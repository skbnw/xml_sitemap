      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton were scheduled to give depositions this week on Capitol Hill about their ties to Jeffrey Epstein, but their appearances have been officially punted into January.</p> 
<p>It sends a strong signal members of Congress will continue to investigate the late, convicted sex offender — even as the Justice Department is due to release a trove of materials related to the Epstein case by Friday.</p> 
<p>House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair James Comer, who is leading the congressional investigation into Epstein, announced the delay in a letter to an attorney for the Clintons, obtained by POLITICO.</p> 
<p>In that letter, Comer maintained that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton must appear before his committee Jan. 13 and Jan. 14, respectively, or risk being held in contempt of Congress.</p> 
<p>“If your clients do not comply with these new dates, the Committee will move immediately to contempt proceedings,” Comer, a Kentucky Republican, wrote. </p> 
<p>Comer noted that the Clintons’ attorney had said previously the Clintons were unable to testify this week due to a funeral but declined to provide alternative dates for their depositions, prompting him to unilaterally assigned the former first couple new dates early next month.</p> 
<p>The attorney for the Clintons did not immediately return a request for comment. A spokesperson for Bill Clinton has said the former president disassociated himself with Epstein prior to Epstein’s 2019 arrest and had no knowledge of his crimes.</p> 
<p>Bill Clinton was also featured in a picture as part of a recent trove of photographs handed over to the Oversight committee by the Epstein estate. Oversight Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/trump-clinton-gates-included-in-epstein-photo-trove-00688628" target="_blank">released select photos</a> to the public Friday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a time of choosing for a band of vulnerable House Republicans who have long warned about the expiration of key Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> is barreling toward a Wednesday vote on a health care bill he and other Republican leaders are <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/whats-in-the-gop-health-bill-00689950" target="_blank">presenting as an alternative to the tax credits</a> that are set to expire at the end of the month. They have no plans to allow a vote before then on extending the subsidies.</p> 
<p>The early signs are that the group of GOP moderates who have voiced concern about their constituents’ health care costs — not to mention their own political futures — is preparing to fall in line this week.</p> 
<p>"I haven't seen anything objectionable yet,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.) said Monday. “For me to vote against it, I'd have to find something objectionable. I wouldn't vote against it in protest."</p> 
<p>While he said it would be “a huge mistake” to not include an extension, Fitzpatrick said he votes “for or against legislation based on the merits of the bill.”</p> 
<p>Others in the centrist Republican group said much the same privately — that they are still prepared to vote for the GOP health care bill even with their bid for an amendment vote extending the subsidies apparently doomed.</p> 
<p>“We’re not going to cut off our nose to spite our face,” said one who, like others interviewed, was granted anonymity to comment on private discussions among the group.</p> 
<p>If that sentiment holds, it would be the latest instance of how the group of moderates has largely followed Johnson’s lead in 2025 — voting in lockstep on the party’s domestic policy bill despite objections over Medicaid cuts, for instance, and keeping their names off discharge petitions meant to circumvent the speaker’s control of the House floor.</p> 
<p>But the Obamacare lapse represents a particularly acute test for the group at a sensitive moment — after many of them have spoken out publicly.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a>, a Republican in a highly competitive Virginia district, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/kiggans-house-gop-aca-00561747" target="_blank">warned of the political fallout</a> for House Republicans in a closed-door House GOP conference meeting last week. Fitzpatrick and fellow GOP Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/478639" data-person-id="478639">Rob Bresnahan</a> of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/81211" data-person-id="81211">Nick LaLota</a> and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/390300" data-person-id="390300">Mike Lawler</a> of New York and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/159021" data-person-id="159021">David Valadao</a> of California have been involved in efforts to broker an extension of the subsidies, so far to no avail.</p> 
<p>It was already virtually assured the enhanced tax credits enacted and extended by Democrats under former President Joe Biden would lapse on Jan. 1, given the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/senate-rejects-health-care-bills-00686855" target="_blank">Senate’s failure to act last week</a> on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank">Democratic proposal</a> for a three-year extension.</p> 
<p>Forcing a House vote on the matter this week, however, could put additional pressure on Republican leaders to explore a solution next month that would maintain the subsidies in some form for the 20 million Americans who now use them.</p> 
<p>But the GOP moderates, most of whom hail from purple districts and are at serious risk of losing their seats in the midterms, did not find any sympathetic ears among Johnson or his top leadership allies in the final weeks.</p> 
<p>“They made their case,” one senior House Republican involved in the talks said of the centrists. Their last-minute push for a floor vote wouldn’t change party leaders’ belief that they didn’t have the votes to actually pass an extension of the subsidies, the senior Republican added — especially given divides within their conference over abortion coverage.</p> 
<p>Johnson said in a recent interview <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/mike-johnson-obamacare-dilemma-00687068" target="_blank">he understood the “dilemma”</a> facing some of the moderates who have since launched discharge petitions to try to force a vote on an extension. But privately Johnson’s leadership circle was always skeptical that those petitions would ever garner enough support to force the speaker’s hand.</p> 
<p>One big problem for the centrists: They were too late.</p> 
<p>By the time Fitzpatrick and Kiggans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank">launched separate discharge petitions</a> aimed at extending the subsidies, there were not enough legislative days left to trigger a vote before the House adjourns for the year and the tax credits lapse. Notably, the Republican moderates mostly kept quiet during the entire 43-day government shutdown — and didn’t publicly pressure Johnson and fellow GOP leaders to negotiate as Democrats made the expiring tax credits the centerpiece of the fight.</p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick, a co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, vowed last week to keep pushing to extend the subsidies.</p> 
<p>“They can just dig themselves into an ideological corner all day long — it’s not fixing the problem,” Fitzpatrick said about party leaders in an interview. “We can agree that the current construct is flawed, but that letting them expire is not acceptable.”</p> 
<p>Late last week, he and other moderates pushed Johnson to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/12/congress/house-will-vote-on-obamacare-extension-next-week-00689845" target="_blank">allow a vote on a floor amendment</a> to the GOP health care bill or another outlet that would allow skeptical members an opportunity to express support for extending the subsidies.</p> 
<p>But hammering out that amendment has proven intractable, with Johnson indicating directly to the group that he was trying to make something work while others in the leadership ranks remained skeptical they could.</p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick indicated Monday he plans to propose an amendment in the Rules Committee that would be modeled off his bipartisan bill that proposed a two-year subsidy extension with an income cap and other eligibility restrictions. But as of Monday there was no agreement to allow it to come to a vote, Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a> said.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think the final decision’s been made” on the amendment, he told reporters.</p> 
<p>The group of moderates planned to huddle on the House floor Monday night to finalize their strategy for the Tuesday Rules meeting, according to two people granted anonymity to describe the private plans.</p> 
<p>Separately, Fitzpatrick will meet Wednesday with the Problem Solvers to discuss their next steps on health care, two other people said, and he's invited a bipartisan group of rank-and-file senators who have also been exploring a bipartisan deal.</p> 
<p>Valadao, a senior appropriator who heads the centrist-leaning Republican Governance Group caucus, was among dozens of Republicans who lost their seats in 2018 after Republicans tried to repeal Obamacare. He declined to say in an interview Monday how he would vote on the leadership-backed health bill.</p> 
<p>“We’ll see how the amendment plays out,” he said.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/43694" data-person-id="43694">Richard Hudson</a> of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said in an interview Monday he hasn’t given vulnerable members any advice about how they should be talking about the expiring Obamacare subsidies in their districts.</p> 
<p>“What I’ve been saying to my colleagues is that we’ve all got to do a better job of talking about what we’re for,” Hudson said. “Because we have actual policies that would bring down premiums and make health care more affordable — we just need to be more vocal about it.”</p> 
<p>Asked if he was worried about the expiring subsidies costing House Republicans the majority next year, he said, “No.”</p> 
<p>“Premiums are high — we told them they would be high if Obamacare passed,” Hudson said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Thune eyes spending package to tackle military helicopter safety issue</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> suggested Monday that he wants to tackle a contentious provision on military helicopters in a separate spending package — and not by axing it from the annual defense policy bill that’s set to pass this week.</p> 
<p>That’s a blow to Senate Commerce Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/175665" data-person-id="175665">Ted Cruz</a> (R-Texas) and Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51160" data-person-id="51160">Maria Cantwell</a> (D-Wash.), the committee’s ranking member, who have been calling on their colleagues to help strip the language out of the National Defense Authorization Act. </p> 
<p>The nation’s top transportation accident investigator has complained that the NDAA language would allow certain military helicopters to fly without using an advanced location-broadcasting technology in the Washington area, a safety concern raised following the deadly January crash between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.</p> 
<p>Cruz and Cantwell have filed a pair of amendments to both nix the NDAA provision and attach their ROTOR Act, <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_2503" data-bill-id="US_119_S_2503">S. 2503</a>, to the bill instead.</p> 
<p>Referencing the ROTOR Act, Thune said Monday he thinks the dispute over the NDAA language could be handled by holding a vote on attaching the Cruz-Cantwell legislation to a fiscal 2026 appropriations package.</p> 
<p>“I think we’ll get there on that. But, yeah, it’d be really hard to undo the defense authorization bill,” he said.</p> 
<p>During a separate news conference Monday, Cruz appeared to acknowledge that adding his bill to the NDAA could be a tall order, with only a few days left before Congress leaves for the holidays. Instead, he hinted that he was eyeing other landing spots.</p> 
<p>“I’m seeking a vote on the ROTOR Act as part of any appropriations measure before the current continuing resolution expires at the end of next month,” he said alongside Cantwell. Some relatives of victims from the disaster joined them.</p> 
<p>Cruz was referencing the stopgap funding bill that lapses at the end of January, which is not an annual appropriations package.</p> 
<p><b>What’s next:</b> It's unclear whether there will be votes on the two lawmakers’ NDAA amendments, but Thune’s comments suggest that’s unlikely.</p> 
<p>In response to a question from POLITICO about whether Thune has said if he will allow those amendments to get floor votes, Cruz replied, “We don’t have a firm commitment on that yet, but I’m hopeful that we will.”</p> 
<p>Cruz made the pitch that if senators cut the provision out of the NDAA, which is poised to pass this week, the House would be able to “easily” OK the measure again, given how lawmakers in that chamber recently passed it 312-112.</p> 
<p>When asked if he is focusing on the amendment to nix the NDAA language before then attempting to pass the ROTOR Act in early 2026, Cruz said the bottom line is he wants to “fix this problem, and so procedurally, there are multiple, multiple possibilities.”</p> 
<p>He said he’s discussing the subject with Thune, as well as Cantwell.</p> 
<p><b>Context: </b>Cruz and Cantwell have slammed the provision in question, as has Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, who says it would allow the military to resume flying certain helicopters in the Washington area without using the advanced location-broadcasting technology called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out, or ADS-B Out.</p> 
<p>The House and Senate Armed Services committees have defended the language.</p> 
<p>Cruz told reporters he spoke about the topic with President Donald Trump’s team last week, and that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has committed to him that he won’t oppose the ROTOR Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Banking Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151800" data-person-id="151800">Tim Scott</a> is abandoning a push to hold a committee vote on a major cryptocurrency bill this week, punting the issue to next year.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for the South Carolina Republican said in a statement Monday that the panel “is continuing to negotiate and looks forward to a markup in early 2026.”</p> 
<p>“Chairman Scott and the Senate Banking Committee have made strong progress with Democratic counterparts on bipartisan digital asset market structure legislation,” said the spokesperson, Jeff Naft. “From the outset, Chairman Scott has been clear that this effort should be bipartisan. He has consistently and patiently engaged in good-faith discussions to produce a strong bipartisan product that provides clarity for the digital asset industry and also makes America the crypto capital of the world.”</p> 
<p>The move comes following a frantic week of negotiations between top Banking Committee Republicans and a group of Senate Democrats who are working to strike a deal on the legislation. Democrats have pushed for more time for the talks to play out.</p> 
<p>Scott's decision to punt was previously reported by Punchbowl News.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, the No. 2 House Democratic leader, will face a challenge from the left in 2026.</p> 
<p>Jonathan Paz, an organizer and former Waltham city councilor, announced his campaign against Clark, the Democratic whip, in <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vTsVLm-JnGU" target="_blank">a video posted late Sunday night</a> emphasizing the need to “rebuild” the Democratic party.</p> 
<p>“I’m challenging one of the most powerful Democrats in the House because we need new leadership,” said Paz, whose family immigrated from Bolivia. “Let's just call it what it is: our Democratic leaders are failing us. They're not stopping Trump. They're not making life more affordable. They're not building a party for the working class.”</p> 
<p>Paz, who served for four years on the Waltham City Council, more recently founded Fuerza, a volunteer group that responds to ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in the region.</p> 
<p>Clark is likely to be the highest-ranking House Democrat to face a contested primary. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had faced a run by New York City Council Member Chi Ossé, but Ossé <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/05/chi-osse-ends-bid-to-challenge-jeffries-00679466" target="_blank">dropped the bid</a> earlier this month.</p> 
<p>Clark ran unopposed in 2024 and had more than $1.8 million in her campaign coffers as of the end of September. A spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republicans are set to mark their final session week of 2025 with a muddled health care message that’s poised to have a big impact — a nationwide spike in insurance costs after Obamacare subsidies expire in less than three weeks.</p> 
<p><b>— The plan:</b> GOP leaders are eyeing a Wednesday vote on a package of conservative-friendly health policies they released last Friday (Pro subscribers can read <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/12/whats-in-the-house-gops-new-health-bill-00689839" target="_blank">more of the specifics here</a>).</p> 
<p>The proposal — a narrowly-focused attempt at striking consensus in a divided GOP conference — doesn’t include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits that lapse on Dec. 31. Instead, leadership is expected to throw a bone to anxious rank-and-file members by giving them the chance to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/12/congress/house-will-vote-on-obamacare-extension-next-week-00689845" target="_blank">vote on an amendment</a> that would continue the subsidies — a vote that’s almost guaranteed to fail.</p> 
<p>“I expect people are going to have an opportunity to vote their conscience and then go defend their votes back home like we always do,” House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) said.</p> 
<p><b>— Mods scramble: </b>Moderate Republicans in the House and Senate are privately strategizing about how to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/15/gop-obamacare-message-muddled-00690145" target="_blank">pull off an unlikely last-minute deal</a> to avert a health care price shock that could have big ramifications for the midterms. A number of vulnerable Republicans have argued they will lose their seats if the ACA subsidies aren’t extended.</p> 
<p>The Obamacare amendment that GOP moderates are set to offer this week is expected to be a two-year extension of the subsidies with an income cap and other changes — a plan modeled after a proposal from Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine).</p> 
<p>House Democratic leaders are waiting to see what the final amendment looks like. They could try to tank the bill by helping adopt the amendment, though many Democrats have criticized the Fitzpatrick-Golden plan.</p> 
<p><b>— More unhappy campers:</b> Key GOP hard-liners are upset that Republican leaders are allowing an ACA vote at all, and they know they have leverage. They're pushing for more restrictive language in the Obamacare amendment and want commitments on conservative policy wins in health legislation early next year, in exchange for letting the bill proceed. To shore up support with conservatives, GOP leaders are pairing the health care package with two bills that would limit transgender surgeries for minors.</p> 
<p><b>— Why it matters for the midterms: </b>This week’s vote is clear evidence that the GOP is struggling to define an easily digestible message on health care costs heading into next year’s elections, as Democrats stay mostly unified around extending the ACA subsidies.</p> 
<p>Every Senate Democrat voted to advance an Obamacare tax credit extension last week, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has managed to keep most of his members from endorsing compromise proposals from purple-district Republicans.</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders have been unwilling to rethink a 15-year-old party message that Obamacare is a costly disaster, despite growing anxiety from their members about the electoral consequences.</p> 
<p>The saga has left many House Republicans frustrated even if they share concerns about the cost of the subsidies and the legacy of the ACA.</p> 
<p>“A lot of people are receiving this health care — they don’t need the rug pulled out from under them,” Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) told POLITICO last week. “Definitely should have been done a ways back, we could say, because of the shutdown. But we’ve got to do everything we can and then do more.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t see how we just leave things in limbo.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— House to take up permitting: </b>House GOP leaders are eyeing a Thursday morning vote on bipartisan legislation that would aim to speed up energy project permitting. Republicans are working to shore up their votes, with resistant hard-liners arguing the bill would undermine President Donald Trump’s authority to block offshore wind energy projects.</p> 
<p><b>— Thune’s busy week: </b>Senate Majority Leader John Thune is looking to wrap the NDAA and confirm dozens of nominees before Congress leaves town for the holidays. Potential bonus items include some appropriations action and a war powers vote.</p>

<p>Republicans, meanwhile, have engaged in a wide-ranging blame game while scrambling to coalesce behind an easily digestible plan to lower health care costs. That struggle comes to a head this week as House leaders move to put what they hope will be a consensus GOP plan up for a vote.</p> 
<p>House Republican leaders chose a narrow set of proposals to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/whats-in-the-gop-health-bill-00689950" target="_blank">include in that plan</a>, arguing they lacked broad agreement for a more comprehensive undertaking as they seek to satisfy competing GOP factions, including vulnerable Republicans who’ve argued they will lose their seats if the Affordable Care Act subsidies aren’t extended.</p> 
<p>The upshot is that there is no clear, unified GOP message on health care going into the year-end deadline when the tax credits expire — and no guarantee that Republicans will be able to pass anything this week to address the loss of beefed-up subsidies instituted under former President Joe Biden.</p> 
<p>“I expect people are going to have an opportunity to vote their conscience and then go defend their votes back home like we always do,” House Budget Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259549" data-person-id="259549">Jodey Arrington</a> (R-Texas) told reporters about the GOP’s health care strategy.</p> 
<p>Across the Capitol, there are already clear signs of unease. While Senate Republicans mostly united behind a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank">plan that would expand health savings accounts</a> as an alternative, four GOP senators <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/senate-rejects-health-care-bills-00686855" target="_blank">crossed party lines</a> to advance a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank">Democratic proposal</a> that would simply extend the Obamacare subsidies for three years.</p> 
<p>Now rank-and-file Republicans in both chambers are privately strategizing about how to pull off an unlikely 11th-hour deal to avert a health care price shock that has triggered significant anxiety throughout the party about the political blowback they could face in the 2026 midterms. House GOP moderates negotiated an amendment vote that could tack a subsidy extension onto the leadership-backed health bill, but that vote is expected to fail and only serve as political cover for the vulnerable House Republicans.</p> 
<p>That’s because top GOP leaders have resisted scrambling a 15-year-old message their party has been loath to abandon: Obamacare is a costly disaster, and Americans need better options.</p> 
<p>“There's a couple of [issues] that split our conference — that's one of them,” House Majority Leader<a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655"> Steve Scalise</a> said last week.</p> 
<p>The dissonance within the GOP ranks comes as Democrats remain confident their push to preserve the status quo will resonate with voters — especially after making it a central focus of the shutdown fight that ended last month.</p> 
<p>Party leaders have managed to keep Democrats largely unified behind a three-year extension of the expiring subsidies. Every Senate Democrat voted to advance that proposal Thursday. In the House, Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> has managed so far to keep the vast majority of his members from endorsing compromise extension proposals that purple-district Republicans have introduced.</p> 
<p>“Our message is simple: Republicans have created a health care crisis for American families who are seeing their health insurance <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank">rise by 100 to 300 percent</a>, and the solution has been in front of us for a while,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198769" data-person-id="198769">Brad Schneider</a> (D-Ill.), chair of the centrist New Democrats.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump, the GOP’s master of viral messaging, has not been especially helpful when it comes to health care. Trump has repeatedly referred to Obamacare as a “disaster” and railed against insurance companies who collect the federal subsidies — echoing a favorite conservative talking point.</p> 
<p>But he has yet to lay out a specific alternative beyond giving “money to the people” directly to buy health care. Trump gave a nod to the issue during the annual Congressional Ball at the White House Thursday, addressing “Democrats” in the room: “We’re going to start working together on health care. I really predict that.”</p> 
<p>While some of the Republicans present took the comments to mean Trump might be open to striking a so-far elusive health care deal in January, many Democrats doubt he will be willing to come to the table and extend a framework he has railed against for a decade. Moreover, the party is preparing to use the issue — and Trump’s refusal to engage — to hammer Republicans in the midterms as they show vulnerability on cost-of-living concerns.</p> 
<p>“He doesn’t understand the hell that people are going through as they prepare to pay these hugely high health care costs,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51493" data-person-id="51493">Chris Murphy</a> of Connecticut, a member of Senate Democratic leadership.</p> 
<p>On Capitol Hill this week, familiar divides are likely to play out as Republicans come to terms with the impending expiration of the subsidies, which will mean a much smaller swath of Americans will be eligible for tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office projects millions will choose to drop their coverage rather than pay higher premiums.</p> 
<p>Already concerns about political blowback forced House GOP leaders to backtrack from their initial strategy of simply allowing the Obamacare subsidies to expire. As part of their efforts to pass a package of measures meant to erode insurance regulations enacted in the ACA, "the process will allow" for an <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/12/congress/house-will-vote-on-obamacare-extension-next-week-00689845" target="_blank">amendment vote on extending the subsidies</a>, a Republican leadership aide said Friday.</p> 
<p>But that has rankled conservatives who have publicly criticized those Republicans who are supporting an extension, and top party leaders do not expect the amendment will be adopted.</p> 
<p>“My Democratic colleagues broke health care, and now they are down here saying we must give more money to insurance companies,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/3265" data-person-id="3265">Chip Roy</a> (R-Texas) said Friday on the House floor, “and any Republican who goes along with that needs to answer for doing the same thing.”</p> 
<p>Republicans have health care plans, he added, but “what we don’t have is the backbone and the will power to stand up and deliver.”</p> 
<p>Scores of Roy’s colleagues, however, have taken a more nuanced view — that even though they share concerns about the cost of the subsidies and the legacy of Obamacare, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/no-house-gop-health-plan-00684401" target="_blank">they are frustrated</a> their party appears to be confronting the issue only at the last minute with family budgets at stake for thousands of their constituents.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/306852" data-person-id="306852">Dan Meuser</a> (R-Pa.) said last week he wasn’t completely happy with the situation and that Republicans “need to move this along.”</p> 
<p>“A lot of people are receiving this health care — they don't need the rug pulled out from under them,” Meuser said. “Definitely should have been done a ways back, we could say, because of the shutdown. But we've got to do everything we can and then do more. “I don't see how we just leave things in limbo,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is endorsing firefighter union head Bob Brooks in the state’s 7th Congressional District — the potential 2028 presidential contender putting his thumb on the scale in a crowded primary for a seat that’s among Democrats’ top targets to flip in the midterms.</p> 
<p>Shapiro’s endorsement, shared first with POLITICO, comes as the governor is plotting an aggressive push to help his party wrest back control of the House by turning as many as four Pennsylvania districts blue — throwing his weight behind candidates as other governors attempt to nab seats for their parties via redistricting. It’s a strategy that will serve as a major test of Shapiro’s coattails in a critical swing state in 2026, when he’s also up for reelection. And if successful, it could give him a launchpad for a 2028 White House bid.</p> 
<p>Shapiro helped recruit Brooks into the race and is headlining a <a href="https://x.com/JuliaTerruso/status/1993402862563737754?s=20" target="_blank"><u>fundraiser for Brooks’ campaign</u></a> Thursday in Philadelphia. Brooks is competing in a five-way primary as Democrats attempt to unseat GOP Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, who flipped the Lehigh Valley district last year by one of the narrowest margins in the country.</p> 
<p>“[Brooks] is the fighter our friends and neighbors all across the Lehigh Valley deserve in Washington. Throughout his career, Bob has worked hard for the men and women of organized labor — standing up for higher wages, better healthcare, and safer working conditions,” Shapiro said in a statement. “Bob has always had my back — and I am proud to endorse him in this race and stand with him in the fight to make life more affordable and get stuff done for our communities.”</p> 
<p>Brooks called Shapiro’s support “a powerful vote of confidence in our campaign.” Brooks, the head of the statewide Pennsylvania firefighters union, <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/politics/2022/06/shapiro-picks-big-endorsement-statewide-firefighters-union/368357/" target="_blank"><u>backed Shapiro early</u></a> in his 2022 gubernatorial bid.</p> 
<p>It’s part of a broader undertaking by Shapiro to remake the state Democratic Party and spearhead its midterms efforts. Shapiro has <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-5285-dc40-a1bb-77e578660000" target="_blank"><u>installed allies atop the state party</u></a> and funneled cash into its coffers. He’s already endorsed Janelle Stelson in her repeat bid to unseat GOP Rep. Scott Perry in the state’s 10th District, after she lost by barely a percentage point last year. Formal endorsements of Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti and Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie against vulnerable GOP Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Brian Fitzpatrick, respectively, are expected in the new year.</p> 
<p>Brooks has racked up endorsements from across the political spectrum — from the moderate Shapiro to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).</p> 
<p>But Shapiro’s endorsement is unlikely to clear a field that has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/01/democrats-2026-primaries-house-00670194" target="_blank"><u>divided Democratic special interest groups</u></a> and where another candidate, Ryan Crosswell, has so far been the fundraising leader.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For months, President Donald Trump has used unconventional tactics to install loyalists as top federal prosecutors across the country, and battled challenges to their authority. Now, he appears to be conceding defeat.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has signaled in recent days that it may refocus its efforts on trying to eliminate a Senate procedural tool used to block U.S. attorney nominees, rather than continuing to challenge the disqualifications in court. The move comes after New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/alina-habba-steps-down-as-new-jerseys-top-federal-prosecutor-00680823" target="_blank">resigned from her post</a> following a court ruling upholding <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/01/alina-habba-appeals-court-ruling-00671224" target="_blank">her disqualification</a> along with a handful of other U.S. attorneys who have been stripped of their positions by federal judges.</p> 
<p>On Friday, Delaware U.S. Attorney Julianne Murray also <a href="https://x.com/Murray4DE/status/1999475044494532645" target="_blank">left her post</a>, citing the Habba ruling.</p> 
<p>The administration’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/19/trump-us-attorneys-senate-confirmation-bypass-00515124?cid=apn" target="_blank">tactics with U.S. attorneys</a> — bypassing the Senate or sidestepping federal judges to keep unvetted prosecutors in place — are a crucial component of Trump’s effort to deploy the Justice Department against his perceived enemies. He has relied on loyalist U.S. attorneys to pursue what critics call baldly political investigations and prosecutions, including those against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.</p> 
<p>On Thursday, Trump called the so-called “blue slip” process, in which home-state senators can veto judicial or U.S. attorney nominees, a “scam.” It’s his latest attack after Trump has spent months <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/21/trump-us-attorneys-republicans-00617024" target="_blank">pressuring Senate Republicans</a> to review <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/25/grassley-trump-blue-slip-criticism-00522724" target="_blank">the practice</a>.</p> 
<p>“‘Blue Slips’ are making it impossible to get great Republican Judges and U.S. Attorneys approved to serve in any state where there is even a single Democrat Senator,” Trump wrote in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115701239677984151" target="_blank">a social media post</a>. “So unfair to Republicans, and not Constitutional.” He directed Senate Majority Leader John Thune “to get something done, ideally the termination of Blue Slips.”</p> 
<p>Thune quickly <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/b-00686585" target="_blank">rejected</a> that call, and Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley has indicated <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/25/grassley-trump-blue-slip-criticism-00522724" target="_blank">no interest</a> in scrapping the practice. Grassley also blamed the administration for failing to advance more U.S. attorney nominees, saying he has been “hamstrung waiting for background investigations and other paperwork from the administration.”</p> 
<p>Asked for comment, a White House spokesperson referred to Trump’s public statements.</p> 
<p>Earlier in the week, Trump appeared to acknowledge that the court rulings disqualifying his U.S. attorneys will ultimately force them out of their offices, even though many have remained there following the rulings.</p> 
<p>Trump-installed federal prosecutors in the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/28/judge-los-angeles-top-federal-prosecutor-illegally-appointed-00626804" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a> area, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/us-attorney-nevada-cases-00589343" target="_blank">Nevada</a> and in the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/24/james-comey-letitia-james-cases-lindsey-halligan-00666896" target="_blank">Eastern District of Virginia</a>, for example, have continued working in those offices despite being deemed disqualified. Trump, however, seemed to predict that may not continue.</p> 
<p>“We have about seven U.S. attorneys who are not going to be able to keep their jobs much longer because of the blue slip,” Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHBAMvZ-mc4" target="_blank">told reporters</a> Monday.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Next stop: SCOTUS?</h5> 
<p>Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the administration appears now to have only two options: continue to try to install temporary U.S. attorneys, only to repeatedly have those choices disqualified by courts, or attempt the traditional process of Senate confirmation.</p> 
<p>Tobias said he suspects the administration doesn’t want the U.S. attorney gambit to reach the Supreme Court. “I think the last thing they want is to have the Supreme Court say no, right? Because then the game is over.”</p> 
<p>That way, he said, “they can continue to do what they've been doing, and that is avoiding advice and consent, which is in the Constitution, which they've done in more than half the districts, and continue to play games with the system.”</p> 
<p>But other legal experts said it wasn’t clear how the Supreme Court might rule. Nina Mendelson, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and an expert on acting officials, said she could envision the court leaning either way.</p> 
<p>“If [the administration] does appeal, the Supreme Court may, on the one hand, be interested in preserving the Senate's constitutional function of advice and consent and thus narrowly interpret the President's authority to appoint acting US Attorneys,” she wrote in an email. “On the other hand, the Supreme Court has, in a series of cases, expressed its concern for presidential control and flexibility, which might prompt it to more generously interpret the President's power.”</p> 
<p>Though the administration can appeal the rulings disqualifying the prosecutors, it hasn’t in two key instances. In the Habba case, the Justice Department has said publicly that it will pursue an appeal, but asked the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals for an extension to decide how it will proceed. New Jersey’s Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, have urged the White House to <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/12/booker-kim-ask-white-house-to-discuss-suitable-habba-replacement-00686144" target="_blank">work with them</a> to select Habba’s replacement.</p> 
<p>In the case involving Lindsey Halligan in the Eastern District of Virginia, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in late November that it would pursue an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/01/james-comey-letitia-james-cases-next-00672339" target="_blank">“immediate”</a>appeal — but it hasn’t.</p> 
<p>Instead, it kept Halligan in place and attempted, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/letitia-james-indictment-grand-jury-00678079" target="_blank">but twice</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/letitia-james-indictment-fails-00687508" target="_blank">failed</a>, to re-indict James. On Thursday, in a sign the White House may be adopting a more traditional approach to installing U.S. attorneys, the administration began seeking Senate confirmation for Halligan by <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/halligan_sjq.pdf" target="_blank">submitting her questionnaire</a> to the Judiciary Committee.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for the committee, however, noted that Halligan doesn’t have blue slips from Virginia’s senators, and “nominees without blue slips don’t have the votes to advance out of committee or get confirmed on the Senate floor.”</p> 
<p>The administration is appealing disqualification rulings in the Los Angeles area and Nevada. In the Northern District of New York, a federal judge appears <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/john-sarcone-letitia-james-subpoeanas-00677169" target="_blank">poised to disqualify</a>John Sarcone III, the Trump-aligned U.S. attorney whose office is pursuing a separate investigation of James.</p> 
<p>Despite Trump’s griping about having his choices blocked, he is on pace to match the Biden administration for the number of U.S. attorneys confirmed during its first year. To date, Trump has seen 13 U.S. attorneys confirmed by the Senate, up from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/26/donald-trump-us-attorneys-senate-confirmation-00583005" target="_blank">just two in September,</a> and 18 more are expected to be confirmed next week, bringing the total to 31.</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1999154682246144409?s=20" target="_blank">“ATTN WH; SEND MORE NOMS,”</a> Grassley wrote on social media on Thursday.</p> 
<p>Legal experts said the uptick in Senate-confirmed top federal prosecutors is a welcome development, even if they aren’t in some of the highest-impact districts.</p> 
<p>“That’s promising for the system,” Tobias said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republican leaders plan to take a vote next week on conservative-friendly health policies they’ve pursued for years. It’s the latest GOP counter to Democrats’ push to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>Here is what’s in the bill, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-149e-d5ec-abbb-dc9e1e070000" target="_blank">the text of which was released Friday</a>.</p> 
<p><span class="story-text__heading-medium">CHOICE accounts</span><br>Oklahoma GOP Rep. Kevin Hern’s <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_HR_3799" target="_blank">CHOICE legislation</a> would allow employers to offer workers tax-advantaged funds to pay for individual health insurance, in lieu of offering a traditional group plan. It would also offer tax incentives for employers who adopt the arrangements.</p> 
<p>Both Republicans and Democrats like the concept because it promotes individual choice in health coverage while also encouraging Obamacare sign-ups.</p> 
<p><span class="story-text__heading-medium">Funding cost-sharing reductions</span><br>When Obamacare was first implemented in 2014, the federal government paid insurers directly to offset cost-sharing reductions, or discounts on deductibles that insurers must offer to people making between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level.</p> 
<p>In response to a lawsuit filed by congressional Republicans, a federal judge in 2016 ruled the government’s payments were illegal because the funding wasn’t explicitly appropriated by Congress. The Obama administration appealed, but the first Trump administration dropped the case and stopped the payments.</p> 
<p>Insurers are still required to offer the cost-sharing reductions, they just no longer get reimbursed by the federal government.</p> 
<p>To make up for the loss of federal dollars, insurers substantially increased silver premiums, a process known as “silver loading.” That’s driven up the amount of federal premium subsidies the government pays insurers, because the subsidy amounts are tied to the second-lowest-cost silver plan in the marketplace.</p> 
<p>Republicans now want to put an end to that practice and start funding the cost-sharing reductions again, which is expected to lower premiums for silver plans, thus lowering the amount Obamacare enrollees receive in premium subsidies, regardless of what type of plan they’re enrolled in.</p> 
<p><span class="story-text__heading-medium">Association health plans</span><br>Association health plans enable several small businesses to band together to get health insurance. The framework includes <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_2528" target="_blank">a bill</a> from Education and Workforce Chair Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) that would permit self-employed people to buy an association health plan.</p> 
<p>Democrats oppose the idea. In addition to not guaranteeing essential benefits, the plans can distort the insurance market by drawing away healthy, young people, according to a statement from Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott, the top Democrat on the Education and Workforce Committee.</p> 
<p><span class="story-text__heading-medium">Stop-loss policy</span><br><a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_2571" target="_blank">The Self-Insurance Protection Act</a> from Rep. Bob Onder (R-Mo.) would expand access for employers to “stop-loss” policies that enable them to protect against catastrophic health costs from just a few employees.</p> 
<p>The bill would ensure that such policies are not classified as traditional health insurance by the federal government. But it has generated pushback from Democrats because it can also restrict states from regulating them.<br><span class="story-text__heading-medium"></span><span class="story-text__heading-medium">Pharmacy benefit managers</span><br>The bill aims to overhaul how pharmacy benefit managers operate. Those are companies that negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and large employers. Pharmaceutical companies and lawmakers have long blamed them for high drug prices.</p> 
<p>A push to change the rules governing the PBMs fell apart last year after Trump adviser Elon Musk tanked year-end legislation, but there continues to be overwhelming bipartisan interest in advancing changes that shed light on the PBMs’ business practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has threatened to pursue contempt charges against former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if they do not sit for depositions in Congress’ probe of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p> 
<p>His warning Friday came after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/trump-clinton-gates-included-in-epstein-photo-trove-00688628" target="_blank">the committee released new photos</a> from the estate of the late convicted sex offender, including a signed photo depicting the former president smiling alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for her role in his child sex trafficking operation.</p> 
<p>Comer excoriated the Clintons in a statement for apparently refusing to participate in the investigation. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Clintons in August, and has requested they sit for depositions next week.</p> 
<p>“It has been more than four months since Bill and Hillary Clinton were subpoenaed to sit for depositions related to our investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s horrific crimes. Throughout that time, the former President and former Secretary of State have delayed, obstructed, and largely ignored the Committee staff’s efforts to schedule their testimony,” Comer said.</p> 
<p>He said the House Oversight Committee will seek to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress if they do not appear for depositions or reschedule in the coming weeks. Comer scheduled Bill Clinton’s deposition for Wednesday and Hillary Clinton’s deposition for Thursday.</p> 
<p>“If the Clintons fail to appear for their depositions next week or schedule a date for early January, the Oversight Committee will begin contempt of Congress proceedings to hold them accountable,” said the statement.</p> 
<p>Bill Clinton’s ties to Epstein have been publicly known for years. His association included traveling on Epstein’s private plane after he left office. A spokesperson for the former president has said he cut off ties with Epstein prior to his 2019 arrest and was unaware of Epstein’s alleged crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>House GOP leaders race to release health care package Friday</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republican leaders are rushing to release a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/04/congress/johnson-house-gop-health-care-plan-00676661" target="_blank">new health care package</a> Friday, but a morning meeting with members of key GOP faction left unsettled whether to allow a floor vote on extending expiring Obamacare tax credits.</p> 
<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> and other members of his leadership team want to file text of the health care legislation as soon as possible in order to comply with House notice requirements and prepare it to be take up by the House Rules Committee early next week. But the matter has been held up as they negotiate with conservative hard-liners who are wary of teeing up a vote to extend the expiring insurance subsidies.</p> 
<p>“This is going to be a great piece of legislation that everyone will be united around," Johnson told reporters after the meeting.</p> 
<p>The core package is expected to include an expansion of health savings accounts and association health plans, as well as funding for cost-sharing reductions that help low-income Obamacare enrollees afford their plans. But moderate House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/house-republicans-weigh-vote-on-obamacare-extension-00688189" target="_blank">want an amendment vote</a> to add what is likely to be a two-year extension of the enhanced tax credits that were enacted by Democrats during the Covid-19 pandemic and are set to expire Dec. 31. </p> 
<p>GOP leaders had been planning to let the subsidies expire, but they are now inclined to allow a floor amendment on an extension, according to four people granted anonymity to describe the closed-door Friday morning meeting with Johnson and a swath of senior Republicans.</p> 
<p>The current thinking among House GOP leaders, three of the Republicans said, is that the amendment would fail on the floor. But the GOP moderates who support a subsidy extension would be likely to support the final package anyway, two other Republicans said, believing that voting for something to lower health care costs would be better than nothing.</p> 
<p>One possible wrinkle: Some Democrats could end up supporting the amendment, giving it enough backing for adoption. But that could lead some conservative Republicans to abandon the bill, and Democrats are not likely to support its other provisions — potentially tanking the final product.</p> 
<p>Conservatives, including Budget Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259549" data-person-id="259549">Jodey Arrington</a> (R-Texas), have strongly objected to any attempt to continue the tax credits.</p> 
<p>"I pity the Republican that has to explain why they would propagate or perpetuate, I should say, a fraud-ridden subsidy from the Covid era to prop up a failed health care program," Arrington said Friday, saying it would make Republicans "complicit in propping up the very driver" of rising health care costs.</p> 
<p>But he suggested a vote on an extension would happen regardless: "I expect people are going to have an opportunity to vote their conscience and then go defend their votes back home like we always do."</p> 
<p>House Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a> said the topic was “heavily discussed” in the meeting, which another senior House Republican described as “lively.” Leaving the session, Scalise said leaders would be "making final decisions shortly, because we have to file text later today.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein tie the convicted sex offender to President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, tech billionaire Bill Gates and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.</p> 
<p>These men and others are featured in the roughly 95,000 photos the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has received from the Epstein estate as part of its ongoing investigation. House Democrats released batches of photos on Friday. </p> 
<p>“It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends,” the Oversight Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, said in a statement. “These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.”</p> 
<p>When asked about the latest photos, Trump said he had not seen them.</p> 
<p>"There are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him. So that's no big deal," he told reporters Friday in the Oval Office. "I know nothing about it."</p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson in a statement accused Democrats of "selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions."</p> 
<p>"The Democrat hoax against President Trump has been repeatedly debunked and the Trump Administration has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends," she continued. "It’s time for the media to stop regurgitating Democrat talking points and start asking Democrats why they wanted to hang around Epstein after he was convicted.”</p> 
<p>Jackson also accused House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Del. Stacey Plaskett, Democratic delegate for the Virgin Islands, of maintaining ties with Epstein following his sex trafficking charges. Plaskett was found in a recent release of Epstein emails to have been texting with Epstein during a congressional hearing to get information about the panel's witness, Trump's ex-fixer Michael Cohen.</p> 
<p>A Jeffries spokesperson pointed to a recent CNN interview where the leader said he had no knowledge of email outreach to Epstein, nor did he receive a donation.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Plaskett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Other individuals in the photographs beyond Trump also did not respond to requests for comment Friday. </p> 
<p>The Justice Department is required to release the full tranche of Epstein-related documents by Dec. 19, per the terms of legislation Congress passed last month.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/0e/37/685cef5140028f8517d3b0951d0c/embargo-holdforepsteindocs-016.JPG" alt="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate of Bill Clinton, center, Ghislaine Maxwell, center right, and Epstein, far right, with two unidentified people, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files." data-portal-copyright="House Oversight Committee" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="House Oversight Committee" data-title="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate of Bill Clinton, center, Ghislaine Maxwell, center right, and Epstein, far right, with two unidentified people, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files."/><p>Of the photos shared Friday, one features Trump alongside someone who appears to be a young woman (her face has been redacted). Another shows Trump standing beside Epstein — who died by suicide in his jail cell in 2019 — chatting with a woman, while a third has Trump grinning among a half-dozen women whose faces have also been redacted. In that shot, he appears to have his arm around one woman’s waist.</p> 
<p>There is another photo in the tranche showing pictures of "Trump condoms" being sold for $4.50 each, branded with the words, “I’M HUUUUGE!”</p> 
<p>There is a signed photo from Clinton depicting him smiling alongside Epstein and Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years for her part in the sex trafficking scheme. While Clinton's association including travel on Epstein's plane after the former president left office is well-documented, Clinton has said he cut ties with Epstein before his 2019 arrest and had no knowledge of his crimes.</p> 
<p>The images underscore Epstein’s long and storied network of connections to powerful men across industries, from filmmaker Woody Allen to conservative strategist Steve Bannon. They were sent to Capitol Hill after a subpoena from the Oversight panel for materials from the late financier’s estate, separate from the documents demanded from the Justice Department by legislation.</p> 
<p>While Epstein’s connections with these public figures are far from new revelations, they highlight the extent to which Epstein reveled in his relationships with powerful people.</p> 
<p>Gates, the Microsoft founder, is seen smiling at Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, in one photo and grinning beside a pilot in front of a plane in another. That photo has been published previously.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/19/d4/d433a4794d03843cd6e2aa31900e/embargo-holdforepsteindocs-011.JPG" alt="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate of Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files." data-portal-copyright="House Oversight Committee" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="House Oversight Committee" data-title="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate of Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files."/><p>Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, is seen in one photo on what appears to be a small plane. He and Epstein forged a relationship during Summers' tenure as president of Harvard University, and he's the latest public figure to face fallout from his connections to the financier, including being <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/american-economic-association-imposes-lifetime-ban-on-larry-summers-00673686" target="_blank">banned from</a> the American Economic Association and forced to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/larry-summers-steps-back-from-harvard-responsibilities-00661238" target="_blank">step back from his roles</a> at Harvard.</p> 
<p>In a November statement, Summers said he took "full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein."</p> 
<p>Bannon, who served as Trump’s chief strategist during his first term, is seen in the photos talking with Epstein at a desk and standing beside Epstein in front of a mirror, posing for a selfie. </p> 
<p>In another photo, Bannon appears to be speaking with Allen. </p> 
<p>Bannon has not responded to requests for comment from various news outlets since appearing in some of the earlier Epstein file releases, but over the summer <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/07/14/maga-factions-epstein-fallout-reactions-00452358" target="_blank">told attendees at a Turning Point USA summit</a> that “Epstein is a key that picks the lock on so many things, not just individuals but also institutions.”</p> 
<p>Allen <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/woody-allen-jeffery-epstein-prince-andrew-wife-jrkm02l6l" target="_blank">has said</a> he attended dinner parties with Epstein and said the financier "couldn't have been nicer." He also said he never saw Epstein with underage girls.</p> 
<p>One photo shows Epstein with a smiling Richard Branson, the billionaire businessman who founded the Virgin Group.</p> 
<p>Trump has maintained that he ended his relationship with Epstein years ago and called the efforts clamoring for the release of the files a “hoax.” In a pivot last month, he gave congressional Republicans his nod of approval to vote to release the Epstein files and swiftly signed the legislation into law.</p> 
<p>Those files are due in the coming days, after courts cleared the way for the Justice Department to release grand jury materials and the 30-day clock for Attorney General Pam Bondi to make the contents public is winding down. A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Clinton, meanwhile, has been subpoenaed by the Oversight panel, but a date has not yet been announced for his testimony to congressional investigators. Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/14/trump-epstein-investigation-department-of-justice-00651851" target="_blank">has ordered Bondi</a> to investigate Democrats with ties to Epstein, including Clinton and Summers. Bondi asked Jay Clayton, U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, to lead the charge.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/4a/a8/c17119e94ce886b523c1b2de0178/embargo-holdforepsteindocs-015.JPG" alt="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate of Woody Allen, left, and Steve Bannon, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files." data-portal-copyright="House Oversight Committee" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="House Oversight Committee" data-title="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate of Woody Allen, left, and Steve Bannon, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files."/><p>It's not clear when the rest of the photos will be released, though a Garcia press release noted that Oversight Democrats would be released "to the public in the days and weeks ahead," while remaining "committed to protecting the identities of survivors."</p> 
<p>Speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill Friday, Garcia said his staff had only gone through a small portion of the materials and appropriate redactions would require days and weeks of committee work. Other photos turned over to lawmakers include depictions of women and Epstein's properties, he added.</p> 
<p>"Obviously, there are photos of powerful men and folks that we want to have an opportunity to speak with and ask questions of," said Garcia.</p> 
<p>"The so-called Department of Justice under the Trump administration needs to comply with the law," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at his weekly press conference Friday. "We as Democrats, led by Robert Garcia ... are going to continue to make sure that we're holding this administration accountable."</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for House Oversight Republicans blasted Democrats' unilateral release.</p> 
<p>“Once again, Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Committee Democrats are cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump. We received over 95,000 photos and Democrats released just a handful," the spokesperson said in a statement. "Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we’ve received shows any wrongdoing. It is shameful Rep. Garcia and Democrats continue to put politics above justice for the survivors.”</p> 
<p>Oversight Committee Democrats released several dozen additional photos Friday evening showing what appears to be the Epstein property and a dental chair in a room surrounded by wall-mounted masks of men's faces, as well as a zoom-in of a "massage therapy system" and Epstein himself in a bathtub.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/7e/b1/7bc38c2b4f4d8fb07a85c45fc28b/embargo-holdforepsteindocs-019.JPG" alt="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate shows a massage therapy system, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files." data-portal-copyright="House Oversight Committee" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="House Oversight Committee" data-title="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's estate shows a massage therapy system, released on Dec. 12, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files."/><p><i>Nicholas Wu, Sam Sutton, Lisa Kashinsky, Gregory Svirnovskiy and Faith Wardwell contributed to this report.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Capitol agenda: Johnson stares down another revolt — this time on energy permitting</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 08:00:00 EST</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson is facing another intraparty revolt — one that has nothing to do with health care, defense policy or pay for college athletes.</p> 
<p>Johnson wants the House to vote on a bill next week from Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) that would accelerate the production and delivery of domestic energy. For Republicans, the energy permitting revamp would fulfill a yearslong legislative priority — and for President Donald Trump, his dreams of achieving U.S. energy dominance.</p> 
<p>But some conservatives want to speed up the federal permitting process only for fossil fuels. <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/conservatives-sound-alarm-about-westermans-nepa-bill/" target="_blank">And they’re furious</a> that Westerman’s measure, which advanced out of committee with bipartisan support last month, would ease the path for green energy projects, too.</p> 
<p>The GOP will likely need to supply all the votes on a procedural rule — as per usual in the majoritarian House — to tee up the measure for floor debate. Right now, the votes may not be there.</p> 
<p>“We’re taking in … whether [the legislation] goes far enough to free up all the constraints put on oil, gas and nuclear and whether it’s still promoting too much wind and solar,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who sits on House Rules. </p> 
<p>The meltdown prompted Johnson to delay consideration of the bill from this week to next. But hard-liners have yet to budge, and Westerman told POLITICO Thursday there are no plans to remove some of the most controversial language to appease them.</p> 
<p>Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/12/conservative-lawmakers-warn-trump-against-gop-led-nepa-overhaul-00684686" target="_blank">escalated their campaign against the measure</a> this week in a new letter to Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.</p> 
<p>“Your administration would have fewer tools to rightfully halt offshore wind development, and projects currently being blocked by successful court actions brought by your administration would see a second life,” they warned of the consequences of Westerman’s bill becoming law.</p> 
<p>Van Drew told POLITICO he plans to share his concerns directly with the White House in the coming days.</p> 
<p>For now, Johnson plans to plow ahead as GOP leadership aides work to resolve outstanding issues, three people close to negotiations told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“We are working through it,” Westerman said in an interview. “We’re just taking everybody’s input under consideration right now and focusing on the big picture of getting permitting reform done.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— House moves on health care: </b>Moderate House Republicans are talking with leadership about possibly <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/house-republicans-weigh-vote-on-obamacare-extension-00688189" target="_blank">setting up an amendment vote</a> that could add an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies to a health care package expected on the floor next week, according to four people granted anonymity to describe internal conversations.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders will likely meet with a few more Republican groups Friday morning before finalizing the package. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Thursday he is hoping to file the bills Friday.</p> 
<p><b>— Speaking of health care: </b>The Republican Study Committee is hosting a briefing Friday morning on health care polling with the Foundation for Government Accountability, according to a copy of the event invitation obtained by POLITICO. The invite says the briefing will feature “critical polling showing what the American people really care about when it comes to health care.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hopes for a quick patch saving millions of Americans from sharply higher health insurance premiums have given way to expectations of a long slog on Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>It is now all but certain that enhanced Obamacare subsidies first implemented by Democrats as a Covid relief measure will expire Dec. 31 after the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/senate-rejects-health-care-bills-00686855" target="_blank">Senate voted down</a> competing partisan health plans Thursday and House GOP leaders indicated they had no plans to bring an extension up for a vote this year.</p> 
<p>Less certain is when lawmakers might begin to pick up the pieces — or if they have any hope of finding a solution. A bipartisan group of lawmakers continues to talk about a possible 11th-hour path forward, hoping that the failed votes this week can give them some badly needed momentum. But most of their colleagues are convinced the discussions won’t bear fruit until 2026.</p> 
<p>A major obstacle is that leaders in both parties are, at least so far, prioritizing plans that don't bridge existing political gaps. Top Republicans are putting forward proposals that would not extend the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, while Democrats are sticking to proposals that most in the GOP say they cannot accept.</p> 
<p>“We don’t have a lot of time,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51218" data-person-id="51218">Lisa Murkowski</a>, an Alaska Republican who voted for both parties’ proposals Thursday. She said she was “talking to people of good will and good faith about how we might be able to sketch” out a compromise.</p> 
<p>But Murkowski also said in a subsequent statement that Congress needs to reach an agreement by Jan. 15 — a concession talks are likely to slip into next year.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/221844" data-person-id="221844">Mike Rounds</a> (R-S.D.), who has been involved in loose bipartisan health care discussions for months, said he hoped the failed votes would lead negotiators to “bridge the impasses.” But asked if there was any way to prevent the subsidies from lapsing, he said, “I honestly don’t know.”</p> 
<p>The stakes for American families are considerable. Independent analysts say those who purchase insurance directly from the ACA exchanges could <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank">see their premiums spike</a> by an average of about $1,000 a year. For some, it could be considerably more. The political stakes are also vast, with many moderate Republicans fretting that a lapse would threaten their reelection campaigns and endanger the GOP’s congressional majorities.</p> 
<p>That sense of panic has not trickled up to Republican leaders, who appear ready to send lawmakers home next week until Jan. 6. By that time, the enhanced subsidies will have lapsed — returning the tax credits to prepandemic levels that assist a much narrower swath of Americans. The Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61734" target="_blank">has estimated millions of Americans</a> will go without insurance as people drop their plans to avoid having to pay higher premiums.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> left the door open Thursday to an 11th-hour deal but also acknowledged the obvious: They don't have a lot of time.</p> 
<p>“We’ll see where the discussions go,” Thune told reporters after the failed votes. “I think we’ll get a sense for that here pretty soon.”</p> 
<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, meanwhile, is plowing forward with a plan to hold a vote next week on a House GOP-authored health care framework that, according to three people granted anonymity to describe internal discussions, will not include a subsidy extension. Instead it is likely to mirror aspects of the Senate proposal that mostly united Republicans Thursday but failed to leapfrog the chamber’s 60-vote legislative threshold.</p> 
<p>Yet to weigh in is President Donald Trump. While he voiced support this week for giving federal money “to people,” not insurance companies, he also has avoided taking a firm stance for or against an extension of the subsidies.</p> 
<p>The White House appears to be tacitly on board with Johnson’s decision not to pursue an extension, with administration officials believing that path unifies the GOP.</p> 
<p>"The idea is to put together a package before Christmas that has unity with 218 Republican votes in the House," said a person familiar with health care discussions on the Hill and in the White House who was granted anonymity to discuss them.</p> 
<p>“The biggest threat these days is the discharge petition," the person said, adding that the only way to avoid it is to "put together a consensus plan" among House Republicans.</p> 
<p>It was a reference to ongoing bipartisan effort to circumvent leadership and force floor votes on legislation that would temporarily extend the expiring Obamacare subsidies while imposing new eligibility requirements. Two such petitions have been filed and received Republican sign-ons in recent days.</p> 
<p>Neither petition has yet to garner the sweeping support from Democrats needed to succeed, however. Instead, Democratic leaders are pushing to discharge a bill that would simply extend the current subsidy framework for three years — to the doorstep of the next presidential election.</p> 
<p>“Every single House Democrat is supportive of a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> told reporters Thursday. “All we need are four Republicans to join us.”</p> 
<p>With nothing likely to make it to Trump’s desk by the end of the year, lawmakers are increasingly turning their attention to January. Many view the Jan. 30 government shutdown deadline as the real cutoff for a bipartisan health care deal.</p> 
<p>Some conservative Republicans are pushing their party to simply pursue a partisan health care bill under the budget reconciliation process, which can skirt the Senate’s 60-vote supermajority requirement. They argue that Democrats are not actually interested in compromising and instead want to run their midterm campaigns on the expired subsidies.</p> 
<p>“I know there are some on my side who say 60-vote bills stand the test of time, yadda yadda yadda,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260075" data-person-id="260075">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.) said. “There are not going to be 60 votes. The Democrats think this is a great political issue for them.”</p> 
<p>But others are talking about paths to compromise, even as bipartisan negotiations have struggled to gain traction over months of attempts before, during and after the 43-day government shutdown where Democrats made extending the subsidies the centerpiece of their demands.</p> 
<p>One idea already floating around the Senate Thursday was to merge the GOP plan, which expands health savings accounts, with an extension of the subsidies accompanied by the kinds of restrictions contemplated in the House bills subject to discharge petitions. Thune said he is being kept in the loop on the bipartisan and bicameral conversations about how to quickly come up with a deal before the holidays.</p> 
<p>Few, however, thought that approach could come together that quickly.</p> 
<p>“It would be great if we could get it done next week, but realistically I think we’ve got to look at it as next week but also January,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151837" data-person-id="151837">John Hoeven</a> (R-N.D.).</p> 
<p>Among Republicans, the pressure posed by the subsidy cliff is rivaled by the anxiety they are feeling about the approaching midterms. GOP lawmakers in both chambers are warning that they are handing Democrats’ a political cudgel to use against them next year if the tax credits expire.</p> 
<p>Democrats will pick “sympathetic cases” to use against Republicans, retiring Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907">Thom Tillis</a> (R-N.C.) predicted, “and there will be plenty of them.” Sen. Jim Justice (R-W.Va.) added that if Republicans are not concerned about the midterm implications, “then you're living in a cave.”</p> 
<p>But Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> warned it might already be too late.</p> 
<p>“The toothpaste is out of the tube,” he said Thursday. “Once Jan. 1 comes and everyone is locked into their insurance proposals, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moderate House Republicans are talking with GOP leaders about possibly setting up an amendment vote that could add an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies to a health care package expected to move across the floor next week, according to four people granted anonymity to describe internal conversations. </p> 
<p>GOP leaders have been skeptical of such a move. But they’re currently working through whether it could pass muster with other Republicans, and it’s under discussion as centrist House Republicans grow desperate to hold off the expiration of the subsidies that more than 20 million Americans use, the four people said. </p> 
<p>Those leadership conversations also include whether to include Texas Rep. August Pfluger’s bill redirecting the tax credits into health savings account contributions as part of the GOP health package next week. </p> 
<p>Other options are under consideration as GOP leaders continue working on a plan Thursday, with Majority Leader Steve Scalise saying in a brief interview he wants to file the bills Friday. </p> 
<p>Two of the GOP moderates, Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, have launched discharge petitions to force an extension vote, but those are unlikely to succeed before the subsidies expire on Dec. 31. </p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick spoke to Johnson about the push during a meeting in his office Thursday, according to another person granted anonymity to describe the meeting. Fitzpatrick and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) also huddled with Johnson on the floor later Thursday. </p> 
<p>But Republican leaders are still working through what have so far been intractable issues over using the subsidies to fund abortion coverage, which risks the ire of at least some GOP hard-liners. There are fears adding it as an amendment could imperil the entire package, with key conservatives on the Rules Committee opposed to an ACA extension able to block its consideration. </p> 
<p>But many more House Republicans — even some conservatives — believe there needs to be some sort of subsidy extension as a bridge. “I think we have to have that,” one conservative granted anonymity to speak candidly about a possible amendment. </p> 
<p>Rep. Ralph Norman (S.C.), one of the hard-liners on the Rules Committee, said he opposes the inclusion of a subsidy extension but would not say if he would move to block it from getting a vote.</p> 
<p>“I don't want the discharge petition where you won't have anything,” he said. “We'll see how it goes.”</p> 
<p>The House wrangling over an Obamacare patch comes after four Republican senators voted Thursday to advance a Democratic proposal for a three-year subsidy extension. There are ongoing bipartisan conversations among rank-and-file senators about how to get a deal across the finish line before they leave for the holidays. </p> 
<p>Senate Majority John Thune has left the door open to taking up a bill if it can get through the House but said in an interview Thursday evening that he was not personally encouraging House Republicans to send over a bill. </p> 
<p>“I’ve talked to the speaker, and I think he’s trying to gauge where his members are and see what the traffic will bear over there,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem offered an uncompromising defense of the administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement before lawmakers on Thursday, as questions swirl about her future in the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>In her opening remarks at the House Homeland Security Committee’s annual threats hearing, Noem argued that the number of people who have left the United States voluntarily since President Donald Trump took office shows that the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement is working.</p> 
<p>“Under President Trump’s leadership, DHS is securing our borders, we’re restoring the rule of law, and we’re protecting the homeland,” Noem said. “We have sent a strong message to criminal illegal aliens that we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will deport you.”</p> 
<p>In the face of criticism from Democrats about alleged misconduct on the part of U.S. immigration officers, Noem also defended the conduct of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, arguing that Democrats were unfairly villainizing immigration officials and contributing to violence against them and their families.</p> 
<p>The hearing, an annual occasion which sees Homeland Security secretaries and FBI and NCTC directors testify before congressional committees about the threats the country faces, came at a particularly precarious moment for Noem. While Trump reiterated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-declares-support-cabinet-official-after-report-he-considering-replacement" target="_blank">confidence in Noem on Wednesday</a>, Trump allies have floated the names of several potential replacements as frustrations have boiled over in recent months with how DHS has spent money intended to boost the government’s deportation efforts and how DHS has managed federal disaster relief money.</p> 
<p>Democrats took advantage of the rare appearance by Noem on Capitol Hill to re-up allegations that Noem gave a $220 million contract to a firm tied to the spouse of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin and argue that immigration enforcement officers have violated the civil rights and due process of unauthorized immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.</p> 
<p>Ranking member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51647" target="_blank" data-person-id="51647">Bennie Thompson</a> (D-Miss.) and other Democrats called on Noem to resign, arguing that her tenure has been marked by incompetence, corruption and other malfeasance.</p> 
<p>Democrats also noted it was only Noem’s second appearance before the House committee and one of the few times a DHS official had testified before the committee, as they slammed DHS for a lack of transparency with Congress. Thompson claimed that it had been very difficult to secure DHS officials as witnesses for hearings.</p> 
<p>“Never in the history of the committee has a secretary of Homeland Security hidden from congressional oversight like you and your department have, Secretary Noem,” Thompson said at the start of the hearing.</p> 
<p>House Homeland Security Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/240947" target="_blank" data-person-id="240947">Andrew Garbarino</a> (R-N.Y.). also asked Noem to commit to providing more DHS officials to testify before the committee, which the secretary agreed to do.</p> 
<p>Noem received most of the questions from Democrats and Republicans at the hearing, which also included fellow witnesses Michael Glasheen, the operations director of the FBI’s national security branch, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent. The two faced more questions once Noem left the hearing early to helm a FEMA-related meeting.</p> 
<p>In a potential sign that Republicans see Noem’s position as relatively secure, GOP lawmakers went soft on Noem, voicing general satisfaction with the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement and homeland security broadly.</p> 
<p>“The border is secure, the flow of drugs is slowing, and violent criminals are being taken off the streets. America is once again a symbol of global strength,” Garbarino said.</p> 
<p>“Please go back to your agencies and thank the men and women that are serving every day and helping to keep this country safe,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/523822" target="_blank" data-person-id="523822">Tony Gonzalez</a> (R-Texas), who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p> 
<p>But Republicans did push Noem to help them conduct oversight of the department’s work. New York lawmakers from both parties asked Noem to explain why DHS decided to cut counterterrorism grants to the Empire State. Trump reversed that decision following advocacy from New York lawmakers.</p> 
<p>Democrats also confronted Noem with videos and specific cases that they claim demonstrate the excesses of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy toward unauthorized immigration.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/431425" target="_blank" data-person-id="431425">Seth Magaziner</a> (D-R.I.) pointed to a case where a Korean-born U.S. Marine who served in the U.S. invasion of Panama was deported to Korea earlier this year over drug possession charges from the 1990s. His staffer had the Marine join the hearing via Zoom and held up the livestream with the Marine over Magaziner’s shoulder while the Rhode Island Democrat questioned Noem.</p> 
<p>“These people are not the worst of the worst,” Magaziner said. “You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys. Go after the terrorists. Do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”</p> 
<p>Noem pledged to review the individual cases brought up by Magaziner and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189588" target="_blank" data-person-id="189588">Lou Correa</a> (D-Calif.), but reiterated the Trump administration’s view that it cannot, and should not, make distinctions between the levels of criminal wrongdoing foreign nationals have committed.</p> 
<p>“It is not my prerogative, my latitude, or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country and in which broad discretion of the secretary used to follow you can issue,” Noem said.</p> 
<p>Democrats scoffed at that idea.</p> 
<p>“You have broad discretion as the secretary,” Magaziner responded. “You can do all kinds of things. You’re choosing not to.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee voted Thursday to return Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51338" data-person-id="51338">Henry Cuellar</a> to his leadership position on a powerful spending panel following his pardon on federal corruption charges.</p> 
<p>“We got ratified,” Cuellar told reporters following the vote.</p> 
<p>The veteran Texas lawmaker overcame <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/henry-cuellar-appropriations-vote-00685842" target="_blank">private concerns inside his party</a> about restoring him as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security subpanel after President Donald Trump granted him clemency in a surprise move last week.</p> 
<p>But Cuellar remains popular in the Democratic Caucus, particularly among longtime colleagues — some of whom argued that with the pardon wiping away his bribery indictment, the legal process had run its course and there was no reason to bar Cuellar from the post under caucus rules.</p> 
<p>“Just look at the rules,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198762" data-person-id="198762">Lois Frankel</a> (D-Fla.). “There’s nothing more to say.”</p> 
<p>Still, the fact that the vote even happened meant that at least one Democratic appropriator privately objected to reappointing Cuellar by acclamation. If his party retakes the House majority next year, Cuellar would be in line as subcommittee chair to directly oversee more than $60 billion in annual spending on agencies including Customs and Border Protection and ICE.</p> 
<p>Democrats have made a high-profile push in recent weeks to police ethical transgressions in the party’s ranks. Nearly two dozen Democrats led by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/429181" data-person-id="429181">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a> of Washington broke ranks to reprimand Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/304652" data-person-id="304652">Chuy García</a> (D-Ill.) for apparently engineering his retirement announcement to ensure a favored ally would succeed him.</p> 
<p>Illinois Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307305" data-person-id="307305">Lauren Underwood</a> has served as the top Democrat on the subpanel since Cuellar’s indictment last year alleging he took some $600,000 in bribes from foreign entities. Cuellar has denied wrongdoing and cast his indictment under President Joe Biden as political retribution for his moderate immigration stances.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> said Thursday he understands the “dilemma” facing House Republicans who have launched or joined discharge petitions that would <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank">force a vote to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies</a>. But he gave no indication he would change his current course of letting the tax credits expire.</p> 
<p>"Leadership’s never in favor of discharges,” Johnson said in a brief interview Thursday. “I understand the dilemma they see themselves in. But, I mean, I don't endorse it."</p> 
<p>GOP leaders are planning to put <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/no-house-gop-health-plan-00684401" target="_blank">several health care bills up for a vote</a> next week before lawmakers leave Washington for the holidays. But they still have no intention of including a subsidy extension, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal GOP plans.</p> 
<p>The two GOP-led petitions — one put forward by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.), another by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.) — picked up several more Republican signatures Thursday. But neither can trigger a floor vote on an Obamacare subsidy extension this month.</p> 
<p>That’s due both to a waiting period for discharged bills under House rules, as well as the fact that massive support from Democrats will be needed to reach the necessary 218 signatures. Democratic leaders are still deciding whether to support either bill.</p> 
<p>Republican leaders don’t plan to stand in the way if any petition reaches 218 signatures, but they are skeptical that will happen. They face serious challenges in rallying their party around any extension of the subsidies, including the GOP’s long opposition to Obamacare as well as abortion-related divisions within their conference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate rejected dueling health care bills Thursday, all but guaranteeing that Obamacare subsidies used by more than 20 million Americans will lapse at the end of the year.</p> 
<p>Senators voted 51-48 on advancing a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank"><u>GOP health care plan</u></a> that would have expanded health savings accounts as an alternative to the expiring tax credits. <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank"><u>Democrats’ plan</u></a> to extend the Covid-era enhanced subsidies for three years also received a 51-48 vote. Both proposals fell well short of the 60 votes needed to vault a key procedural hurdle.</p> 
<p>The votes both went largely, but not entirely, along party lines. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to oppose the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/cassidy-crapo-unveil-alternative-to-obamacare-subsidies-00682315" target="_blank"><u>GOP plan</u></a>. Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Dan Sullivan of Alaska voted to advance the Democrats’ health care plan. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who would have voted for the GOP plan, missed the votes. </p> 
<p>Paul said his party’s bill, written by Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho, amounted to “Obamacare lite,” while Collins, Hawley and Murkowski have expressed sharp concerns about allowing the subsidies to expire.</p> 
<p>“Unfortunately, the votes that we have just had — neither one kind of gets us there. But there are elements in both that I support,” Murkowski said about her votes to advance both bills. </p> 
<p>Sullivan said he voted to open debate on the Democratic proposal but wanted to make changes to it. Meanwhile, Hawley said that while both parties' proposals would need changes, “I just think we’ve got to do something." </p> 
<p>"So I'm in the all-of-the-above category,” he said.</p> 
<p>Thursday’s Senate votes were part of a deal Senate Majority Leader John Thune made with Democrats to end the government shutdown that ended last month. Senators have widely acknowledged for weeks that the votes were aimed more at messaging than forcing through passable bipartisan compromise.</p> 
<p>Still, a deal in the Senate was likely Congress’ best shot at preventing the subsidies from lapsing and raising premiums for many Americans who buy their insurance directly through Affordable Care Act exchanges. While the lapse will not completely eliminate the tax credits, they will revert back to pre-pandemic levels and <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank"><u>many families could still see their premiums rise</u></a> by $1,000 a year or more.</p> 
<p>“Our bill is the last train leaving the station,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote, urging Republicans to support the Democratic bill.</p> 
<p>The House is similarly riven by partisan divides. Republican leaders have no plans at the moment to put a subsidy extension up for a vote before adjourning for the year next week. Democratic leaders in the chamber, like Senate Democrats, want to extend the expiring tax credits by three years; two bipartisan bills proposing shorter extensions are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank"><u>subject to discharge petitions</u></a> that could force action — but not until next year.</p> 
<p>Thune said if a bill is able to pass the House, “obviously we’ll take a look at it.” But he shared a note of skepticism, saying, “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”</p> 
<p>Rank-and-file senators are leaving the door open to trying to strike a last-minute bipartisan deal, but they are effectively out of time. The Senate is expected to adjourn next week until January, and, while bipartisan talks are ongoing, they’ve failed to gain momentum. </p> 
<p>After Thursday’s failed votes, senators were already floating trying to merge the health savings account flexibility in the GOP bill with an extension of the subsidies with an income cap and other eligibility restrictions. But multiple sticky political fights, including a clash over abortion restrictions, would need to be resolved in a passable deal.</p> 
<p>“I hope that after today they will feel like they’ve checked the messaging box and will get serious about actually doing something about the spiraling health care costs under Obamacare,” Thune said ahead of the vote. “Republicans are ready to get to work. I’m not sure yet if the Democrats are interested.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said she was open to negotiating long-term health care reforms but added that with time running short, extending the credits is the “easiest” immediate solution.</p> 
<p>“We need to act now,” Shaheen said. “I know there are members in both parties who want to find a responsible path forward.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maryland Democrat David Trone, a former three-term House lawmaker who left his seat to launch an ill-fated Senate run in 2024, is making a play for his old job in a primary challenge against first-term Rep. April McClain Delaney, he announced Thursday.</p> 
<p>The battle — in a blue-leaning district Republicans have targeted in the past — could set up an extraordinarily expensive primary between Trone and Delaney, both of whom have multimillion-dollar fortunes.</p> 
<p>Trone hopes his opposition to President Donald Trump will help drive his campaign.</p> 
<p>“Watching Trump and Republicans’ assault on our democracy — weaponizing the government and tearing apart families — is intolerable and goes against everything we stand for,” he said in a statement. “Our fundamental freedoms are being dismantled piece by piece. The people of Maryland’s 6th District need a fighter who will stand up against these attacks every single day.”</p> 
<p>The wealthy wine magnate has self-funded his runs for office before. Trone <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/04/total-wine-trone-maryland-senate-campaign-00095218" target="_blank">spent some $17 million in his successful 2018 House campaign</a>. He then parted ways with more than $60 million in the 2024 Senate primary, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/14/angela-alsobrooks-wins-messy-democratic-senate-primary-in-maryland-00158054" target="_blank">which he lost by more than 10 points to then-Prince George’s County Executive</a> Angela Alsobrooks.</p> 
<p>But McClain Delaney, the wife of former House lawmaker and onetime presidential candidate John Delaney, isn’t ready to go quietly.</p> 
<p>“David Trone thinks I should ‘step aside’ so he can have his old office back after he abandoned the district to run and lose for Senate,” she said in a statement Thursday. “He has the arrogance of a Trump.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of House Republicans is trying to bait President Donald Trump into the permitting wars on Capitol Hill, arguing that legislation up for a vote as soon as next week could green-light something he hates with fury: offshore wind power.</p> 
<p>Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) wants the House to pass his bill that would accelerate energy projects of all kinds, which would give him leverage in expected negotiations with the Senate in the coming months on overhauling the federal permitting process.</p> 
<p>But the legislation has drawn sharp opposition from conservatives who claim it could benefit renewable energy projects already benefitting from tax incentives, plus limit the Trump administration’s ability to block projects like offshore wind.</p> 
<p>“Believe me, nobody hates wind turbines more than me — except the president of the United States,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.). "We all need assurances."</p> 
<p>He paused, and added: "Assurances sometimes just aren't good enough."</p> 
<p>Van Drew and Reps. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) teamed up with House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) in writing a letter to Trump this week that warned the Westerman bill — which passed out of committee with bipartisan support — "undermines your stated policy agenda of rightfully ending offshore wind development and other 'Green New Scam' projects approved under the poor leadership of the Biden Administration, particularly development off the Atlantic Coast."</p> 
<p>They are mainly concerned about language added to the bill during the recent Natural Resources markup of the Westerman measure that could limit the administration’s ability to scrap an already-issued permit — a provision members on both sides of the aisle support.</p> 
<p>Van Drew said in an interview he had heard that the White House wanted to make sure the legislation would not promote offshore wind, which could make this bipartisan amendment problematic in a final product.</p> 
<p>But Westerman and other lawmakers want any permitting overhaul bill to be “technology neutral” after criticizing Democrats for putting policies in place that would benefit renewable energy.</p> 
<p>Westerman defended his product Wednesday, saying the White House has been briefed and is “well aware of where we are.”</p> 
<p>He added, “I expect the administration to still support the bill. I haven’t gotten any indication the administration isn’t supportive of the bill.”</p> 
<p>A White House spokesperson did not return a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), one of the House's most conservative voices, has also expressed reservations about the Westerman legislation.</p> 
<p>"I don’t want to fast-track any of the wind and solar. It’s still not a neutral playing field because it’s subsidized," said Roy, who pushed — unsuccessfully — for the immediate repeal of renewable energy credits in the GOP megabill enacted over the summer.</p> 
<p>Although some Democrats support the bill — including co-sponsor Jared Golden of Maine — others want stronger language to prevent the president from scrapping permits, among other changes.</p> 
<p>The League of Conservation Voters is urging lawmakers to vote “no,” arguing that “the biggest problem right now is the fact the Trump administration is not allowing any wind, solar or battery projects to move forward in the permitting process.”</p> 
<p>This means opposition from even a handful of Republicans could tank a vote on a procedural rule to take up the bill on the chamber floor, which are typically party-line affairs.</p> 
<p>Westerman said earlier this week that he was looking to meet with bill critics. Indeed, he was seen chatting with Smith on the House floor Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>“Hopefully we’ll work through it and get to a point where we can get the bill on the floor and get a good vote on it,” Westerman said.</p>

      <title>Senate GOP still not interested in nixing blue slips, Thune says</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune poured cold water on a fresh call by President Donald Trump for Republicans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/21/trump-us-attorneys-republicans-00617024" target="_blank">nix the "blue slip" practice</a> that gives senators an effective veto over presidential nominees to certain posts in their states.</p> 
<p>“There are many Republican senators, way more Republican senators who are interested in preserving that than those who aren’t," Thune told reporters. He comparing it to the overwhelming GOP sentiment in favor of keeping the 60-vote filibuster rule, which Trump also opposes.</p> 
<p>The blue slip precedent applies to nominees to serve as district judges, U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals. Among the Trump appointees who have not gotten Democratic assent is Alina Habba, his pick for U.S. attorney in New Jersey who was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/alina-habba-steps-down-as-new-jerseys-top-federal-prosecutor-00680823" target="_blank">recently disqualified from her acting role</a> by a federal court.</p> 
<p>Opposition from Democrats is not the only obstacle to confirming more Trump appointees, however: Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said during a committee meeting Thursday he would like to process more judicial nominees but is waiting on Trump to send them.</p> 
<p>According to his prepared remarks, Grassley said he would also like to advance more U.S. attorney picks, but “I’m hamstrung waiting for background investigations and other paperwork from the administration.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republicans just showed how divided they are over health care. Thursday's Senate votes could expose the party’s strife even further.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans know both parties’ health care proposals are doomed Thursday. But as Democrats prepare to unite behind a three-year extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson can’t get Republicans on the same page.</p> 
<p><b><i>—&nbsp;</i>In the Senate: </b>Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is the only definite GOP defector on Thursday’s vote on a framework by Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that would <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/cassidy-crapo-unveil-alternative-to-obamacare-subsidies-00682315" target="_blank">expand health savings accounts</a> rather than extend the enhanced Obamacare tax credits.</p> 
<p>But a handful of Republicans have not yet said how they would vote, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. And Florida Sen. Rick Scott — who has a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/20/congress/rick-scott-releases-obamacare-subsidy-alternative-00664146" target="_blank">competing proposal of his own</a> — said he’s still reviewing the Crapo-Cassidy bill.</p> 
<p>Thune is already messaging around Thursday’s near-certain failure and suggesting it’ll spur more serious negotiations.</p> 
<p>“When we get through this exercise this week the question is, ‘Are there enough Democrats who want to fix the problem?’” he told reporters Wednesday. “I think there’s a path forward. ... Obviously we don’t have a lot of time to do this, but I think there are ways in which you could, where there’s a will.”</p> 
<p><b>— In the House:</b> At least 10 Republicans on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank">signed a bipartisan discharge petition</a> authored by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine) that would extend the enhanced tax credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) also moved Wednesday to file a discharge petition on <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/new-aca-subsidy-extension-bill-draws-16-gop-co-sponsors-00685285" target="_blank">their own proposal</a> that would extend subsidies for a year with new guardrails.</p> 
<p>Both efforts are direct challenges to House leaders who appear determined to let the subsidies lapse. But they would likely need all House Democrats — and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is pushing a measure to compel a vote on a three-year extension. Asked if he would support Fitzpatrick’s bill Wednesday night, Jeffries said he had not had the opportunity to look at it yet.</p> 
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told POLITICO he’s “not a fan of discharge petitions,” adding that the extension framework being proposed in the Fitzpatrick-Golden bill is one of many that has split the GOP conference.</p> 
<p>But Golden and other centrists are urging leaders not to brush off brewing discontent.</p> 
<p>“Leadership, no matter who they are, in both parties, House and Senate, should pay attention to what’s going on with discharge petitions,” Golden said.</p> 
<p><b>— From the White House: </b>Meanwhile, lawmakers are getting mixed signals about whether President Donald Trump wants Republicans to utilize the filibuster-skirting process of reconciliation to advance a party-line package to address affordability concerns, including health care.</p> 
<p>Asked Wednesday if he wants to see another megabill move through the Hill next year, Trump <a href="https://x.com/MicaSoellnerDC/status/1998866841314455599?s=20" target="_blank">told reporters</a> “we don’t need it.” But hours later, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair <a href="https://x.com/semafor/status/1998899662145646906?s=46&amp;t=ncdqfRV74gcQrRg3XkYQbA" target="_blank">told Semafor</a> the administration “would love to do” another reconciliation bill.</p> 
<p>“That’s really a partisan tool, and then obviously there’s bipartisan pathways too,” Blair said. “Which one opens up is largely contingent on whether or not the Democrats want to work on anything.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Democrats are uneasy about a push to restore Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51338" data-person-id="51338">Henry Cuellar</a> to a powerful committee role following a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/henry-cuellar-pardon-reelection-party-00674518" target="_blank">pardon from President Donald Trump</a>, potentially complicating his bid to regain influence over federal spending.</p> 
<p>Cuellar relinquished his post as the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee overseeing Homeland Security funding in 2024 after he was indicted on federal corruption charges. But following Trump’s pardon last week, party leaders have indicated that he is now eligible to retake the post under caucus rules.</p> 
<p>But not all of his fellow House Democrats are comfortable with a lawmaker accused of bribery and other offenses regaining direct control over more than $60 billion in annual spending, especially with a parallel Ethics Committee investigation still in motion. Compounding these concerns are Cuellar’s relatively conservative views on border policy and his potential sway over the budgets for agencies including Border Patrol and ICE.</p> 
<p>The matter is in the hands of the 27 Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee, who are set to take a secret ballot vote Thursday to determine Cuellar’s future on the panel.</p> 
<p>Several have private misgivings, and the fact that the vote is even happening means at least one Democratic appropriator privately objected to Cuellar’s return as ranking member. Otherwise, he would have been approved by acclamation.</p> 
<p>“That position is critical — it's Homeland Security,” said a Democratic appropriator granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations. “Your moral values are important — at least mine are — and I can't look at myself in the mirror and vote for him.”</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307305" data-person-id="307305">Lauren Underwood</a> of Illinois, who has served as the top Democrat on Homeland Security since Cuellar was indicted, could vote to keep Cuellar out so she can keep the job. Another appropriator, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196272" data-person-id="196272">Grace Meng</a> of New York, said Wednesday she was undecided on the matter.</p> 
<p>Other wild cards include Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/429181" data-person-id="429181">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a> of Washington, who led a push to formally reprimand a Democratic colleague last month, and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/75165" data-person-id="75165">Mike Quigley</a> of Illinois, who might vote in state solidarity with Underwood. Quigley had <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/03/congress/mike-quigley-takes-a-shot-at-house-democratic-grandees-00382170" target="_blank">been leapfrogged</a> by a more senior lawmaker who returned to the panel and has voiced criticism of Democratic leaders since then.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Cuellar declined to comment.</p> 
<p>The veteran Texas Democrat has been quietly canvassing members about regaining his role and reassuring those in his party who question the optics of wiping away an indictment sought by former President Joe Biden’s Justice Department at a time when the party is focusing on Trump’s alleged ethical violations.</p> 
<p>Top party leaders have not weighed in directly on the matter. House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> said Tuesday that Cuellar was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/henry-cuellar-appropriations-00683379" target="_blank">likely to regain</a> his committee leadership position, citing the caucus rules, while Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51351" data-person-id="51351">Rosa DeLauro</a> of Connecticut, the top Appropriations Democrat, in a statement merely acknowledged the Thursday vote.</p> 
<p>“We are holding a meeting tomorrow to discuss several issues, including who will serve as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee,” the statement said.</p> 
<p>The dilemma comes as some Democrats are making a high-profile push to police ethical transgressions in the party ranks. Last month, almost two dozen Democrats led by Gluesenkamp Perez <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/12/congress/mgp-vs-chuy-garcia-00650119" target="_blank">broke ranks to reprimand</a> outgoing Illinois Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/304652" data-person-id="304652">Chuy García</a> for apparently engineering his surprise retirement announcement to ensure a favored ally would succeed him.</p> 
<p>Democrats have railed against Trump’s use of his clemency powers, which has benefited political allies and major donors. Cuellar’s pardon puts him in the company of such figures as former Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich and ex-Rep. George Santos, who are odious to Democrats.</p> 
<p>“I've had nothing but good interactions with Henry in Congress, but we can't be the party of following the law and say it's just fine to break it and get a pardon from Trump,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227127" data-person-id="227127">Seth Moulton</a> (D-Mass.), who is running for Senate.</p> 
<p>Several other Democrats this week aired criticism of Trump’s pardons without specifically commenting on Cuellar and his bid to regain power inside the Democratic Caucus.</p> 
<p>“President Trump's continued efforts to pardon politicians that are either convicted or accused of corruption is just wrong,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/25648" data-person-id="25648">Andy Kim </a>(D-N.J.). “And this is exactly the kind of problem that causes so many Americans to lose trust and faith in our politics.”</p> 
<p>Kim, a former member of the House, succeeded Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who is currently serving a prison sentence for bribery and other charges.</p> 
<p>“I don’t agree with any of the president’s pardons of members of Congress,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259488" data-person-id="259488">Angie Craig</a> (D-Minn.), who is also running for Senate.</p> 
<p>Cuellar was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/03/congress/cuellar-indicted-00155977" target="_blank">indicted on federal corruption charges</a> that alleged he took some $600,000 in bribes from foreign entities. Still, the veteran lawmaker remains largely popular with his fellow Democrats, some of whom argued that with the indictment wiped away, the process had run its course.</p> 
<p>“Under our system of laws, you're still innocent until proven guilty,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/251521" data-person-id="251521">Troy Carter</a> (D-La.). “He was indicted but never went to trial — was never proven to be guilty, never proven to be innocent, because there was no trial, but the pardon overrides that. That’s how the ball bounces.”</p> 
<p>Others deflected criticism to Trump, who suggested in social media posts after the pardon that he expected Cuellar to retire or switch parties and run as a Republican in a gesture of gratitude. Instead Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat almost immediately after the pardon came through, and with the legal cloud over his campaign lifted, it increases the chances his seat will remain in Democratic hands in 2026.</p> 
<p>“Nothing else seems to compare to this president and the abuse of the pardon power to get things he wants, including potentially people switching their party affiliation,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/422519" data-person-id="422519">Greg Landsman</a> (D-Ohio).</p> 
<p>Cuellar’s allies quietly insist he shouldn’t be sidelined given his unique ability to win a South Texas district that Republicans have targeted for years — and recently redrew in hopes of ousting him. Now, with the pardon, even some Republicans acknowledge he’s in prime position to remain in Congress — and potentially hold a gavel next year if the majority flips.</p> 
<p>“He’s going to have a very merry Christmas,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51507" data-person-id="51507">Michael McCaul</a> (R-Texas).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of House Republicans moved to force a vote on extending Obamacare health insurance subsidies that will expire in just three weeks, directly challenging party leaders who appear <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/gop-obamacare-subsidies-expire-00684115" target="_blank">determined to let them lapse</a>.</p> 
<p>At least six Republicans signed a discharge petition filed Wednesday on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6501" target="_blank">bill</a> authored by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/179757" data-person-id="179757">Jared Golden</a> (D-Maine) that would extend the expiring tax credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. The subsidies are currently used by more than 20 million Americans.</p> 
<p>“It's a time-sensitive matter, and it's an existential matter,” Fitzpatrick told reporters after filing the petition. “You try to do things through the normal course. You try to do things through regular order. You know, [when] all those remedies are exhausted, then you’ve got to go this route, unfortunately.”</p> 
<p>Another discharge petition, seeking a vote on a one-year subsidy extension authored by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260077" data-person-id="260077">Josh Gottheimer</a> (D-N.J.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.), was also filed Wednesday and quickly picked up support from several Republicans. </p> 
<p>The moves to sidestep Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> came as a growing number of mainstream House Republicans publicly warned that their leaders’ apparent plan to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/06/obamacare-plans-schumer-trump-congress-00679712" target="_blank">allow the tax credits to expire</a> without a replacement in place will cost them their majority in next year’s midterm elections.</p> 
<p>“If we fumble this health care ball, nothing else is going to matter,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259537" data-person-id="259537">John Rutherford</a> of Florida said. “If we don't win the majority in the midterms, then none of this matters. We can't do anything good then. I think everybody understands that.”</p> 
<p>Johnson did not include a subsidy extension in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/no-house-gop-health-plan-00684401" target="_blank">menu of options he presented to members</a> in a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning, and some conservative hard-liners who attended spoke against the idea.</p> 
<p>But many members in the meeting spoke up to call for an extension, to the point that Republicans leaving the room thought that they had in fact decided to forge ahead with an extension.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196450" data-person-id="196450">Jeff Van Drew</a> (R-N.J.) said it would be a “bad move” for Republicans to allow the tax credits to lapse, adding that he was “worried about my colleagues.”</p> 
<p>“There's a lot of good people who won by one, two, three or four votes,” he said. “Do I think this issue is worth a couple points in an election? Yeah, I do.”</p> 
<p>The Republicans joining Fitzpatrick in signing the discharge petition include Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227109" data-person-id="227109">Don Bacon</a> of Nebraska, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/478639" data-person-id="478639">Rob Bresnahan</a> of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260571" data-person-id="260571">Kevin Kiley</a> of California, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/390300" data-person-id="390300">Mike Lawler</a> of New York and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/194184" data-person-id="194184">Ryan Mackenzie</a> of Pennsylvania, with New York Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/81211" data-person-id="81211">Nick LaLota</a> also indicating he planned to sign. Kiggans signed the petition to discharge her own bill, along with Fitzpatrick, Lawler, Mackenzie and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/159021" data-person-id="159021">David Valadao</a> of California. </p> 
<p>That would be enough to force a vote eventually if all House Democrats sign on to the proposal, but that is by no means assured. House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> is pushing a separate discharge effort on a three-year subsidy extension that does not include new eligibility requirements.</p> 
<p>"There’s one discharge position that I'm committed to at the moment," he said Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Even if either petition garnered the necessary 218 signatures, it would not trigger a vote before the Dec. 31 expiration of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits passed under former President Joe Biden. Either measure is subject to a waiting period of at least seven legislative days under House rules, with only six session days left in the year.</p> 
<p>Golden, a centrist Democrat who is retiring after his term ends, said leaders of both parties should pay heed to this discharge petition and others that have succeeded this Congress.</p> 
<p>“Leadership, no matter who they are, in both parties, House and Senate, should pay attention to what's going on with discharge petitions,” he said.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump has so far not weighed in publicly on the extension of the subsidies, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693" target="_blank">saying only</a> that he “wants to give money to the people,” not to insurance companies. Various GOP plans have been proposed that would direct money to health savings accounts instead of premium subsidies that go directly to insurers.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans are expected to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/senate-republican-heath-vote-00683250" target="_blank">support one such proposal</a> in a Thursday vote, but it’s not clear it can get more support than the three-year clean extension favored by Democrats.</p> 
<p>None of the alternative proposals has reached critical mass inside the House GOP, and without an extension, premiums for some enrollees on Affordable Care Act marketplaces will soar by hundreds of dollars within a matter of weeks, fueling the panic in the Republican ranks.</p> 
<p>While more GOP lawmakers are speaking out about the subsidy cliff, it’s not clear how many more will be willing to sign a discharge petition — which is typically considered a major breach of party loyalty and an option of last resort.</p> 
<p>For instance, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/367391" data-person-id="367391">Monica De La Cruz</a> (R-Texas) said in an interview she wants to lower health care costs and noted she’s signed onto a plan including a two-year subsidy extension.</p> 
<p>But she said she would have to think about whether she would sign onto a discharge petition.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders have argued, including at Wednesday morning’s conference meeting, that the subsidies are wasteful and that there is not enough internal support to extend them. But others in the party ranks have their doubts.</p> 
<p>“I call bullshit on that,” said one conservative House Republican in a deep-red seat who was granted anonymity to speak frankly. “Most people here know we need a bridge.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats negotiating a major cryptocurrency bill told key Senate Banking Republicans this week they hope to strengthen prohibitions on stablecoin yield payments and further address concerns about illicit finance, according to <a href="https://politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-09c4-d5ec-abbb-d9d64a3b0000" target="_blank"><u>a summary of a counteroffer obtained by POLITICO</u></a>.</p> 
<p>The document, which summarizes requests that Democrats sent to Senate Banking GOP negotiators on Monday, came after Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/gop-crypto-compromise-offer-00683813" target="_blank">sent an initial offer late last week</a> for a compromise market structure bill, titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.</p> 
<p>"We have accepted significant portions of RFIA – including meaningful concessions on major elements like token classification – in an effort to meet Republicans where they are," the summary of the Democratic counteroffer said. "However, despite these substantial compromises, the offer Republicans sent on December 4th still fails to meet the core principles Democrats released in September."</p> 
<p>The group of Democrats working on the crypto bill “is concerned that payments of interest or yield on stablecoin balances could pull deposits from the banking system, especially from community banks that play a pivotal role in supporting underserved communities and operate under Community Reinvestment Act obligations,” the document said. “Yield also incentivizes risky behavior and could threaten the financial system if a stablecoin were to lose its value.”</p> 
<p>The document also said the working group is “committed to ensuring full slates of commissioners at the” agencies that will be tasked with overseeing digital assets under the bill, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> 
<p>It also said Democrats are pressing for “limits on elected officials and their families from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets while in office.” It additionally included an array of illicit finance provisions and token classification provisions that Democrats are seeking to include in the measure.</p> 
<p>Banking Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is pressing to hold a markup before lawmakers leave for the holiday break at the end of next week, but Democrats are pushing back, casting uncertainty over the timeline for the effort. Crypto-friendly Democrats exited a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning pessimistic about the possibility of a committee vote next week.</p> 
<p>“We’re not ready for it,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a centrist Nevada Democrat who sits on the Banking panel. “We’ve still got to work through illicit activity, money laundering issues that need to be addressed.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a senior Banking Committee member, said “we have wide swaths where we don’t have agreement — even any language.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Scott said in a statement that “Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee have spent months negotiating in good faith, circulating multiple rounds of bipartisan text, soliciting extensive stakeholder feedback, and feedback from their Democratic colleagues.”</p> 
<p>“Chairman Scott remains committed to a bipartisan path forward, but progress requires coming to a compromise on legislative text, not press statements or shifting objections,” said the spokesperson, Jeff Naft.</p> 
<p>The comments come amid a flurry of crypto activity on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ruben Gallego met Wednesday with White House crypto adviser Patrick Witt, along with staff from the Treasury Department.</p> 
<p>Lawmakers involved in the talks are discussing a potential bipartisan member-level meeting on Thursday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss closed-door negotiations. Democrats are also set to meet separately with big bank CEOs on Thursday about the crypto bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY, New York — The <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/28/new-york-upstate-blue-wave-mamdani-00668749" target="_blank"><u>statewide blue wave</u></a> in which New York Democrats made big gains in nearly every corner of the state this November had one glaring exception: Nassau County.</p> 
<p>While Empire State Democrats scored one of their best election nights on record, Republicans held down America’s archetypal suburb, with GOP candidates notching an 11-0 record in contested executive branch races in Nassau. In the marquee race, County Executive Bruce Blakeman improved on his 2021 performance after four years of wholeheartedly embracing President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>Blakeman is hoping to ride that success into next year: He launched <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/republican-bruce-blakeman-planning-to-enter-race-for-new-york-governor-00681465" target="_blank"><u>a 2026 gubernatorial bid</u></a> Tuesday touting his electability.</p> 
<p>“While Democrats made gains nationwide on election night, the Republican party shined bright on Long Island,” the narrator of <a href="https://x.com/NassauExec/status/1998383059863757225" target="_blank"><u>his launch video</u></a> said. “Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman won a Democrat County by 12 percent.”</p> 
<p>Whether Blakeman’s GOP primary opponent Rep. Elise Stefanik can replicate those numbers will be a key question facing Republican voters next June. Blakeman told POLITICO his recent win came down to holding fast to pocketbook issues, hiring more cops and connecting with groups Republicans have ignored in the past. Others say his decisive victory might simply stem from a strong local party organization.</p> 
<p>Whatever the secret of his success, the importance of Nassau extends far beyond next year’s gubernatorial race. It will also be crucial to determining control of the House. </p> 
<p>And it is not just Republicans whose future stands to be shaped by Nassau’s political trends. Democrats have spent years bickering over whether party members in the county have focused too much on distancing themselves from the far left. Moderate Nassau Democrats say progressives like New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have made their jobs tougher.</p> 
<p>“Most of the television commercials that they put up were all about ‘Mamdani, Mamdani, democratic socialists,’” Nassau Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs said. “Their tagline was, in effect, ‘Vote Republican and save Nassau County from becoming a socialist county.’ That plays well with a moderate audience.”</p> 
<p>Democratic struggles in Nassau County have become a regular through line, revisited with each election cycle. While it was at the heart of the national blue wave in 2017 and 2018, the GOP won big there in 2021 local races. Four years after a 16-point Democratic win in Nassau in the 2018 gubernatorial election, the party suffered an 11-point loss in 2022. Then in 2024, Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Nassau County since 1988.</p> 
<p>How that pattern plays out next year remains an open question.</p> 
<p>Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat in a battleground Nassau swing district, “is the number one target in the country for Republicans,” said Larry Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. “They really think they can win in that district and they’re going to put an unlimited amount of money in.”</p> 
<p>An effective GOP candidate at the top of the ticket would help considerably toward that end.</p> 
<p>Stefanik’s team disputed the idea that Blakeman has a magic formula for electoral success, pointing to his unsuccessful bids for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/nyregion/republicans-pick-challenger-for-state-comptroller.html" target="_blank"><u>state comptroller</u></a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2009/01/07/goper-drops-out-of-mayoral-run/" target="_blank"><u>New York City mayor</u></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/nyregion/04repubs.html" target="_blank"><u>U.S. Senate</u></a>. He last ran for higher office when he lost a congressional bid in 2014 — the same year Stefanik flipped a House seat with a 21-point victory.</p> 
<p>Yet Blakeman believes he has a solid case to make.</p> 
<p>He attributed his success this election cycle to holding true to past promises to not raise taxes and hire more police officers, while also building connections to groups Republicans haven’t focused on in the past. He rattled off a long list of outreach efforts undertaken by the county in recent years, such as a Feliz Navidad celebration and a Lunar New Year festival.</p> 
<p>“We also reached out to the Muslim community and talked to them about things that were important to them,” Blakeman said. “I appointed the first Muslim police chaplain in Nassau County history, and shortly I will be appointing the first Sikh police chaplain.”</p> 
<p>Trump, who has become politically toxic in many New York suburbs, will undoubtedly be a factor in next year’s race. On Monday, he described both Blakeman and Stefanik as “great,” and while he has not yet expressed a preference for either, that could change. And arguably no local official in the northeast has done more to associate themselves with Trumpism than Blakeman.</p> 
<p>Under his leadership, Nassau County <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/long-island-democrats-seek-reimbursement-for-trump-rally/" target="_blank"><u>spent more than $1 million</u></a> on police overtime hosting Trump for a campaign rally last fall. Blakeman has been New York’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/hochul-nassau-transgender-athletics-00142865" target="_blank"><u>most visible opponent</u></a> of letting transgender girls participate in female sports and has had the <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2025/02/nassau-county-deputizes-local-cops-act-ice-agents/402777/" target="_blank"><u>county partner</u></a> with ICE on immigration enforcement efforts. In late November, he announced a <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/28/us-news/nassau-exec-bruce-blakeman-plans-a-wall-of-surveillance-at-nyc-border-after-mamdani-win/" target="_blank"><u>wall of surveillance</u></a> on the Queens border to conduct facial recognition on visitors from Mamdani’s New York.</p> 
<p>“I never ran away from President Trump,” Blakeman told POLITICO. “I supported President Trump, and I was very vocal about my support for President Trump”</p> 
<p>The approach is a far cry from how Nassau County Democrats have handled Mamdani.</p> 
<p>Jacobs, who also serves as chair of the state Democratic Party, famously distanced himself from the mayor-elect in the fall, declining to offer an endorsement after Mamdani became the Democratic nominee. And he’s hardly the only local Democrat who falls into that category: “Mamdani’s reckless agenda filled with unachievable promises and contempt for certain groups threatens NY’s economy and safety,”<a href="https://x.com/LauraAGillen/status/1968005348037476728" target="_blank"><u>Gillen said</u></a> this fall.</p> 
<p>Democrats based in New York City contend this is exactly what their counterparts on Long Island should not be doing.</p> 
<p>“When the leading Democrats in the county are telling everyone that the Democratic Party sucks, it’s hard to convince voters to vote for your party,” said state Sen. Deputy Leader Mike Gianaris, who heads the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm. “They should start looking inside themselves and start trying to make a positive case for Democrats, or I think they can expect this to continue.”</p> 
<p>Unlike in Nassau, Long Island’s neighboring Suffolk County showed significant signs of the pendulum swinging back to the left this November. Democrats grew their share of the vote by 10 or more points in four of the five top town races, and they flipped seats in places like Shelter Island and Riverhead.</p> 
<p>Democrats haven’t been completely without hopeful signs in Nassau either.</p> 
<p>They won a victory last month in a newly-drawn county legislative district, denying Blakeman’s allies a supermajority and giving them the ability to put their foot in the door during budget talks. In 2024, Tom Suozzi broke the Republicans’ hold on four congressional seats by winning a special election. Gillen won another seat later that year, thanks to a two-point victory in a district that favored Democrats by 11 points as recently as 2020.</p> 
<p>But even the good Democratic vibes in the 2024 congressional races underscored a long-standing issue in the county — winning back the seat in Suozzi’s special election would not have been necessary if local Democrats had done opposition research into the now-disgraced former Rep. George Santos before the 2022 election.</p> 
<p>The failure to do so illustrates another reality in the area. After decades of controlling Nassau, Republicans built a well-oiled machine.</p> 
<p>“The relative strength of the organizations — it’s just not even close,” said Levy, who likened the GOP’s political operation to that of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. “At a time when all over the country, political organizations are shrinking in influence for a variety of reasons, Nassau still has an old-fashioned Daley machine-like operation that can get a vote out in ways that the Democrats can’t.”</p> 
<p>Democrats didn’t do much to end that structural disadvantage when they won power in 2017.</p> 
<p>“Arguably the Democrats could have, should have done more to leverage the patronage opportunities to raise money and create more foot soldiers to work politically,” Levy said. But any steps they made in that direction were halted when the political winds started to shift: “Anything that happened before the pandemic almost doesn’t count.”</p> 
<p>Jacobs, who said his party was outspent by a more than four-to-one margin in the county executive’s race, didn’t disagree with the characterization.</p> 
<p>“They raised and spent $15 million. That’s an extraordinary amount of money,” he said. “That was supplemented by both county mailings and town mailings that, in my judgement and other peoples’ judgement, were campaign-like pieces paid for by the taxpayer.”</p> 
<p>That onslaught of ads built off years of tying local Democrats to policies like bail reform or high-density housing or candidates like Mamdani, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Kathy Hochul. The Democratic brand “is really doing poorly” in the area, Jacobs said.</p> 
<p>“People — even at the doors when you’re collecting petitions, even when they’re Democrats — are upset with our party,” he said. “That’s been driven by a really well-funded consistent campaign by Republicans to set the narrative that all Democrats are either wild extremists themselves or so afraid of them that they bend to whatever the far left in our party wants. Neither of which is true, but too many people believe it.”</p> 
<p>Nassau Republicans, meanwhile, aren’t shying away from a president whom the opposition characterizes as an extremist.</p> 
<p>“In a county with 110,000 more Democrats, to win by 35,000 votes is something that is very special,” Blakeman said. “You have to be true to your values, and not a phony.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republican leaders presented no firm plan Tuesday for advancing health care legislation as anxiety rises in the GOP ranks over the impending expiration of key Obamacare subsidies at the end of the year.</p> 
<p>Instead, Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> presented attendees of a closed-door conference meeting with list of 10 possible policies that could get votes in the coming weeks or months, according to five Republicans in the room. </p> 
<p>Some were more specific, such as an expansion of health savings accounts and an overhaul of pharmaceutical benefit manager oversight. Others were vague, including one bullet point that simply said, "Innovation." The list did not include an extension of the expiring tax credits.</p> 
<p>The presentation was followed by a heated discussion over the path forward on health care for the party, and vulnerable members including Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.) stood up to warn against the political fallout of failing to extend the expiring subsidies.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/0a/78/b9ba80724925888e1393fbcf672c/gop-health.jpg" alt="A slide on GOP health care legislative options presented at a House Republican Conference meeting on Dec. 10, 2025." data-portal-copyright="House Republican Conference" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="A slide on GOP health care legislative options presented at a House Republican Conference meeting on Dec. 10, 2025."/><p>Some later expressed their dismay at how poorly they believe GOP leaders have handled the topic.</p> 
<p>“There was a general uneasiness because nothing is coming together,” said a House Republican, one of several granted anonymity to speak candidly about the private meeting.</p> 
<p>“We wasted so much time,” one conservative Republican said, also lamenting the lack of a unified GOP plan with just seven session days left in the year. </p> 
<p>More than 20 GOP members spanning various factions inside the conference lined up at microphones to weigh in at one point. Hard-liners, for instance, raised opposition to any extension of the subsidies if they don't include further restrictions abortion coverage, a view that clashes with Republicans in at-risk districts next fall. </p> 
<p>“There was no consensus,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/195970" data-person-id="195970">Ralph Norman</a> (R-S.C.) said.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders continue to believe they are on track to vote on several bills next week on some less controversial items, such as the HSA expansion and funding a program to reduce out-of-pocket costs for Obamacare enrollees. But an extension of the expiring tax credits is not in the cards, according to three other Republicans granted anonymity to describe leadership thinking.</p> 
<p>Johnson indicated in the meeting that Republicans could continue working on health care into the first half of next year — just ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are requesting the Justice Department and FBI hand over internal records related to six Democratic members of Congress with military and law enforcement backgrounds who filmed an anti-Trump video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.</p> 
<p>It comes after some of the Democrats who appeared in the video <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/democrats-fbi-trump-00668584" target="_blank">disclosed late last month</a> that the FBI had contacted the House and Senate sergeants at arms requesting voluntary interviews. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has separately requested a briefing by Dec. 10 of the review into the military record of one of the Democrats, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a Navy veteran.</p> 
<p>“We write with grave concern that the Trump Administration is weaponizing the Federal Bureau of Investigation against federal lawmakers who merely restated current law,” reads the letter, spearheaded by top Senate Judiciary Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-05f6-d744-a5db-0ff6f0d90000" target="_blank">and obtained first by POLITICO</a>. “This abuse of federal law enforcement authority as an instrument of retribution against the President’s political opponents is a threat to the constitutional freedoms of all Americans.”</p> 
<p>Senators added in the letter that it was "particularly alarming” that the FBI would reportedly push its domestic terrorism agents to open up a seditious conspiracy investigation into the six Democrats — two senators and four House members — who participated in the video message.</p> 
<p>“It is facially unconstitutional to prosecute protected speech, whether that speech is by the American people or their representatives in Congress, and it is absurd to contend that statements reiterating the law alone are a predicate for a seditious conspiracy investigation,” the Judiciary Democrats wrote.</p> 
<p>They added, “The Department of Justice’s resources would be better spent ensuring that the Department of Defense is following the law as it conducts military action.”</p> 
<p>Durbin and his colleagues are requesting Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel hand over any documents or communications by Dec. 29, dating back to Nov. 18, between either of the two agencies and President Donald Trump or other White House officials relating to the six lawmakers’ statements.</p> 
<p>They are also seeking any related documents or communications since Nov. 18 between the DOJ or FBI with the Washington Field Office or the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. They are additionally seeking any similar records between the FBI and Justice Department and the Department of Defense. </p> 
<p>Spokespeople for the FBI and DOJ declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>
