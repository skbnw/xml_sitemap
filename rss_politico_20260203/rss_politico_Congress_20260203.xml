      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the third time in less than a year, a spending deal brokered in the Senate has House Democrats feeling left out — and grumbling about their counterparts across the Capitol.</p> 
<p>This time, the agreement between President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic leaders would spare the vast majority of federal agencies from an extended shutdown. Most would be funded through the end of the fiscal year in September, while Homeland Security funding would extend only through Feb. 13.</p> 
<p>But to Democrats up in arms over Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda, that’s still 10 days of DHS funding too many — assuming the deal passes the House as planned Tuesday — leaving them to vent once again about the other chamber.</p> 
<p>“There are some Senate Democrats who always signal nervousness and are so reluctant to be strong,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/239242" data-person-id="239242">Pramila Jayapal</a> (D-Wash.). “We end up having to answer for what they won't do, and it can be very frustrating.”</p> 
<p>“We are far closer to the people,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/304660" data-person-id="304660">Veronica Escobar</a> (D-Texas), adding that it’s “critically important that House members be brought in” during negotiations over immigration enforcement constraints considering ICE, Border Patrol and other agencies are deployed in their districts.</p> 
<p>The interchamber tensions between Democrats are becoming a regular feature of funding fights in the second Trump term. Lawmakers, strategists and voters alike exploded in anger last March when Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> and a handful of colleagues allowed a spending package to move forward amid the Elon Musk-led DOGE assault on federal agencies. In November, tempers again flared when a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to end a record 43-day shutdown.</p> 
<p>This time, the situation is more nuanced. At stake is <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">$1.2 trillion in full-year funding</a> that was negotiated on a bipartisan basis; Democrats generally support the vast majority of the agreement. But the inclusion of the DHS money has been a sore spot — especially after the killing last month of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>A version of the DHS bill passed in the House before the Jan. 24 killing of Alex Pretti garnered only seven Democratic votes. Senate Democrats immediately declared a no-go on full-year funding for the department after the incident, and Schumer and Trump negotiated a two-week punt to allow for further talks.</p> 
<p>Fewer than half of Senate Democratic Caucus members ultimately ended up voting for the deal, however, and support among House Democrats is considerably more scant.</p> 
<p>Asked if House Democrats were sufficiently read in on the Trump-Schumer deal, Democratic Caucus Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/226960" data-person-id="226960">Pete Aguilar</a> said “no” but added, “I don’t think that that’s surprising.”</p> 
<p>“But I think the split among senators was kind of surprising,” the California lawmaker added. “And so … we'll see what happens.”</p> 
<p>The spending package is headed to the floor Tuesday, where it remains an open question if House Republicans will be able to unite on a key test vote. Late last week — facing dissension in his own ranks over having to pass a bill with only temporary DHS funding — Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> entertained using a bipartisan fast-track process.</p> 
<p>But members of Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries’</a> leadership circle were caught unaware — with some downright livid — at Johnson’s confidence that he could pass the bill under that process — which would require a two-thirds-majority vote, meaning at least 70 Democrats would be needed to get it across the line.</p> 
<p>Such a move generally requires tacit agreement from minority party leaders to supply the votes. But Republicans at that point hadn’t asked their Democratic counterparts for a more formal private count of how many Democrats might support the measure, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.</p> 
<p>Jeffries told Johnson just hours later on a private call that Democratic leadership would not commit to delivering the required votes for a fast-track vote, forcing Johnson to gather GOP votes to jump through a procedural hurdle first. Johnson has since accused Democrats of “playing games” with the shutdown-ending package.</p> 
<p>Those interparty antics have helped deflect attention from internal Democratic tensions over the Senate-brokered funding deal, with Jeffries playing down any such rift Monday.</p> 
<p>“I speak regularly with Leader Schumer, and I speak regularly with Mike Johnson,” he said when asked if House Democrats were properly consulted in the funding package negotiations. “There's no daylight between House and Senate Democrats on accomplishing the objective, which is dramatic reform of ICE.”</p> 
<p>Jeffries opposed the prior package, with full-year DHS funding, but would not say Monday how he intended to vote on the revised bill with the short-term stopgap.</p> 
<p>Schumer, for his part, said he spoke with Jeffries during the negotiations that erupted in the Senate following Pretti’s killing. He said after the Senate vote Friday night that Jeffries had agreed on limiting DHS funding to Feb. 13.</p> 
<p>“This bill was negotiated by … [Senate Majority LeaderJohn] Thune and me,” Schumer said. “But I’ve talked to Hakeem Jeffries. For instance, we talked about how long a [stopgap] should be, because we wanted to limit it greatly.”</p> 
<p>Asked about Schumer’s comment Monday, Jeffries said, “I think what we made clear to the Senate is that the original three-month proposal was completely and totally unacceptable.”</p> 
<p>Behind the scenes, Schumer told the White House and congressional Republicans last week that they would need to talk to Jeffries because the bill was going back to the House, according to a person granted anonymity to disclose a private conversation.</p> 
<p>If Republicans can get the bill over the procedural hurdle Tuesday, more Democrats are expected to support it than the seven who backed the previous version. But the party remained sharply divided Monday.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51351" data-person-id="51351">Rosa DeLauro</a> of Connecticut, the top Appropriations Committee Democrat, said Monday she would support the bill on the floor, while another panel leader, Massachusetts Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51512" data-person-id="51512">Jim McGovern</a> of the Rules Committee, said he would oppose it.</p> 
<p>"I will not vote for business as usual while masked agents break into people's homes without a judicial warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment,” McGovern said.</p> 
<p>Others declined to forecast their plans, including members of the Democratic leadership team. Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189606" data-person-id="189606">Ted Lieu</a> of California, the caucus vice chair, said he planned to attend Tuesday morning’s caucus meeting before deciding.</p> 
<p>Several Democrats said they do not expect party leaders to formally whip votes for or against the funding package, with some acknowledging that it would not be an easy decision for members who support the vast majority of the funding bill and also don’t want to see noncontroversial DHS agencies such as FEMA and TSA shut down.</p> 
<p>And blaming the Senate for having to take a tough note, one Democrat noted, is hardly new.</p> 
<p>“I've been here long enough that people always complain about the other chamber, so that's always an easy out,” Aguilar said.</p>

      <title>House Republicans eye next week for housing bill vote</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House leadership is eyeing the week of Feb. 9 for a vote on a bipartisan housing package, according to four people with direct knowledge of the planning.</p> 
<p>Senior lawmakers have also been mulling whether to consider the widely supported bill under suspension of House rules, which would expedite passage of the legislation, said three of the people who were granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p> 
<p>However, plans for the bill are not locked in and could be subject to change as the House deals with a partial government shutdown.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6644?activeTabs=overview" target="_blank">Housing in the 21st Century Act</a>, which <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/12/house-financial-services-advances-housing-package-community-banking-bills-00695771" target="_blank">overwhelmingly advanced through the House Financial Services Committee in December</a>, is part of a push by Congress to pass legislation that could address a growing housing affordability crisis. The bill includes 25 provisions that aim to increase the housing supply, modernize local development and rural housing programs, expand manufactured and affordable housing, protect borrowers and those utilizing federal housing programs, and enhance oversight of housing providers.</p> 
<p>House Financial Services Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227472" data-person-id="227472">French Hill</a> (R-Ark.) said Friday that he’s pushing for the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6644?q=hr+6644" target="_blank">Housing for the 21st Century Act</a> to receive a floor vote expeditiously.</p> 
<p>”I hope that that bill can come to the House floor in just a few days. I really am pushing for that, I think it’s the right decision,” Hill said on Bloomberg Radio.</p> 
<p>The Senate’s housing bill, the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_2651?activeTabs=overview" target="_blank">ROAD to Housing Act,</a> passed the upper chamber as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act but may be put to a separate floor vote. If the House is able to pass its own version by a wide margin before the Senate, it could have additional leverage for negotiations with the upper chamber for a final bill. Hill and other House Republicans have said the Senate bill, which received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate Banking Committee, has a number of provisions that would <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/newsletter/2026/01/the-long-and-winding-road-to-housing-legislation-00736040" target="_blank">not be acceptable among House GOP members</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee as part of the panel's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> 
<p>It's a remarkable reversal for the former president and secretary of state, who last month chose to defy committee-issued subpoenas and risk imprisonment by the Trump Justice Department — but changed their minds as the House prepared to vote Wednesday to call their bluff and hold them both in contempt of Congress.</p> 
<p>The House could end up considering the contempt resolutions this week, anyway. GOP leaders were, Monday night, not ruling out moving ahead with the votes if they ultimately decide the Clintons are not making a good-faith effort to expeditiously schedule their depositions with Oversight members and staff.</p> 
<p>After months of refusing to cooperate, the Clintons announced they were now willing to comply with the subpoenas as the House Rules Committee was in the middle of meeting to tee up consideration on the contempt resolutions for later in the week. The unexpected turn of events scrambled the GOP’s plans and it’s not quite clear what comes next.</p> 
<p>"I think we need more time … to clarify with the Clintons what they are actually agreeing to,” said Rules Chair Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.). “Accordingly the committee will postpone further consideration of the contempt. However, should there not be substantial compliance and agreement overnight, the committee will return to continue the hearing on the contempt."</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Bill Clinton said in a statement on social media that the former first couple “look forward[s] to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”</p> 
<p>The Oversight Committee voted on a bipartisan basis in January to approve a contempt measure for each of the Clintons after both skipped their scheduled depositions earlier this year.</p> 
<p>Although both have said they had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, they have maintained that the subpoenas were not tied to a legitimate legislative purpose, rendering them invalid. Bill and Hillary Clinton also argued that the GOP-led exercise was designed to embarrass and put them in jail.</p> 
<p>“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a statement Monday. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”</p> 
<p>Some Democrats warned House Republicans not to proceed.</p> 
<p>"If you try to move forward, that would be insane," the top Democrat on House Oversight, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, told reporters. "I mean, that would be unprecedented. It would be clearly — it would be clearly a demonstration that [Chair James] Comer is actually not interested in hearing the Clintons, but he's only interested in political games. I think that would be a huge disservice to the survivors and to the investigation.”</p> 
<p>Rep. Suhan Subramanyam (D-Va.), a member of the Oversight panel, also said he feared Republicans would still go through with the House vote for a political end.</p> 
<p>"The Republicans want to give Trump the ability to prosecute and put the Clintons in jail," he said in a brief interview. "That's what this is really about. This isn't about the Epstein investigation.”</p> 
<p>Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested to reporters the Clintons were in a lose-lose situation no matter what happens.</p> 
<p>“This is a snake pit. It's a snake pit,” she said. ‘So it's not a question of whether you have to come in. That’s just the way it is.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior House Democrats are going in different directions on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">massive funding bill</a> headed to the House floor as soon as Tuesday, underscoring the sharp divisions inside the Democratic ranks on the $1.2 trillion spending package.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51351" data-person-id="51351">Rosa DeLauro</a> of Connecticut, the Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Monday she would vote for the funding package when it goes to the floor Tuesday — breaking with a large swath of colleagues who oppose the measure over its extension of Homeland Security funding, including immigration enforcement operations.</p> 
<p>"I will support this package," DeLauro said during Monday meeting of the Rules Committee. She noted it secures funding for the five-full year, bipartisan bills and extends funding at current levels for DHS for 10 days.</p> 
<p>DeLauro said without the DHS stopgap Democrats "won't be able to bring the kinds of pressure" necessary to make changes to the full-year DHS bill they're negotiating with the White House.</p> 
<p>But Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51512" data-person-id="51512">Jim McGovern</a> of Massachusetts, the top Rules Democrat, said he was dead-set against the bill due to the DHS funding.</p> 
<p>"I will not vote for business as usual while masked agents break into people's homes without a judicial warrant, in violation of the Fourth Amendment," he said.</p> 
<p>Neither leader, however, is expected to vote for a key procedural measure setting up a final debate and approval for the massive bill, which passed the Senate on Friday. That measure, known as a rule, is also expected to tee up contempt-of-Congress votes on Bill and Hillary Clinton over their decision not to fully cooperate in a Oversight Committee probe into Jeffrey Epstein. GOP leaders are scrambling to build support for that measure as some in their ranks agitate for amendments, including the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/02/congress/mike-johnson-save-act-spending-00760523" target="_blank">attachment</a> of a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_22" target="_blank">partisan elections bill</a>.</p> 
<p>“Republicans have a responsibility to move the rule, which, by the way, includes a wide variety of other issues that we strongly disagree with," House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> told reporters Monday.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> is pushing forward with a plan to get a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">massive funding package</a> through the House without changes Tuesday, ending a brief partial government shutdown.</p> 
<p>Johnson met with Rules Committee Republicans Monday, shortly before the panel convened to take up a floor plan for the funding bill. The meeting was expected to include discussion of how to handle conservative hard-liners’ demands to attach a partisan elections bill to the $1.2 trillion spending package.</p> 
<p>But any change to the bill could add days more to the three-day partial government shutdown that Johnson is hoping to end Tuesday with House approval of the Senate-passed legislation that combines five full-year funding bills with a two-week extension of Homeland Security spending.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/364729" data-person-id="364729">Anna Paulina Luna</a> (R-Fla.) is vowing to block any move to tee up the Senate-approved package for a final vote unless Johnson moves to attach the elections bill, known as the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_22" target="_blank">SAVE Act</a>. With a razor-thin majority, Johnson can afford no more than one Republican defection on a party-line vote.</p> 
<p>Johnson came out of the Rules meeting Monday playing down the possibility that the elections bill would be added. </p> 
<p>“We all want the SAVE Act. We also look at the reality of the numbers here," he said. "But this is a funding package right now, and I don't think we need to be playing games with government funding. We still have winter storms. We've FEMA and TSA and troop pay and everything else wrapped into this. So we need to get the job done.”</p> 
<p>Johnson got a helping hand Monday from President Donald Trump, who posted on Truth Social that he wanted the funding bill "through the House and to my desk, where I will sign it into Law, IMMEDIATELY!"</p> 
<p>"There can be NO CHANGES at this time," he wrote. "We will work together in good faith to address the issues that have been raised, but we cannot have another long, pointless, and destructive Shutdown."</p> 
<p>House Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a> told reporters Monday that GOP leaders haven’t made any final decisions on how to handle the SAVE Act but Trump emphasized in a recent Oval Office meeting that he wanted the funding legislation quickly passed.</p> 
<p>“The president obviously really wants this,” he said.</p> 
<p>The SAVE Act, which <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2025/04/14/the-house-passed-the-save-act-what-comes-next-00288458" target="_blank">passed the House</a> with scant Democratic support last year, would require citizenship documentation to register to vote and several cut back on mail voting. A new version of the bill would also require photo ID to vote.</p> 
<p>Tacking it on to the funding package would essentially guarantee that the government shutdown Johnson and Trump are desperately trying to end as quickly as possible would continue for days — or longer. Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> warned Monday that the SAVE Act was “dead on arrival” in the other chamber, with Democrats arguing it creates unnecessary barriers to voting.</p> 
<p>“If House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown,” Schumer said.</p> 
<p>Luna said in an interview Monday that her position has not changed as Johnson faces a growing pressure campaign from both his own members and an army of hard-right online influencers pressing for the election bill’s inclusion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House GOP leaders face an uphill battle to pass the revamped government funding package from the Senate, potentially dragging out the shutdown.</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to pass the five full-year funding bills and the two-week DHS stopgap Tuesday relying only on Republicans, after Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told him he wouldn’t help secure the Democrats needed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/31/shutdown-tuesday-house-votes-00759001" target="_blank">to expedite the legislation</a>. GOP leaders will have to quell an internal Republican revolt before they get there.</p> 
<p>Here’s how things are shaping up ahead of Tuesday:</p> 
<p><b>— Democrats divided, Republicans seek unity: </b>Most House Democrats who spoke during a private caucus call Sunday evening were against <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">the package</a>, which was negotiated by Senate Democrats and the White House. House Homeland Security ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) was among the Democrats urging members to oppose it in a Dear Colleague email Sunday night.</p> 
<p>But some senior Democrats on the call said they supported the legislation, including Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and New Democrat Coalition Chair Brad Schneider of Illinois, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the conversation. The disconnect between leadership and other senior members is triggering some hand-wringing among frontline Democrats about what to do next.</p> 
<p>Even though some Democrats are signaling they’d vote for the package in the end, it’s not clear whether Johnson can get past the procedural step of adopting a rule with GOP support still uncertain and Democrats unlikely to bail him out.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders and White House officials are trying to convince key hard-liners to get on board.</p> 
<p>Reps. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) are among the Republicans who want to attach legislation aimed at preventing noncitizens from voting in elections. Some ultra-conservatives oppose the Senate agreement overall and would prefer a Homeland stopgap that lasts six weeks or longer.</p> 
<p>Luna said Sunday night that “<a href="https://x.com/RepLuna/status/2018144774662832275?s=20" target="_blank">these appropriations bills will FAIL</a>” if the election citizenship legislation isn’t included.</p> 
<p><b>— Bigger DHS deal looks tougher:</b> Key lawmakers continue to raise red flags about striking a deal on a full-year DHS funding bill by the time the two-week CR expires.</p> 
<p>Johnson on Sunday <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/mike-johnson-government-shutdown-by-tuesday-00759107" target="_blank">panned Democrats’ demands</a> to bar federal immigration enforcement officers from wearing masks and to require them to wear identification. He also signaled unwillingness to negotiate on tightening requirements for judicial warrants for immigration operations. Jeffries is insisting that an agreement on judicial warrants is “a condition of moving forward.”</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune doesn’t believe Congress can pass a Homeland Security deal in two weeks, telling reporters late last week that “a two-week CR probably means there’s going to be another two-week CR and then maybe another two-week CR after that.”</p> 
<p>“I just think it’s going to be really, really hard to get anything done and then actually execute on the procedures and process we have in the Senate, even if there’s an agreement,” he said.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Johnson to swear in new Dem: </b>Johnson plans to swear in Houston Democrat Christian Menefee before votes Monday night, pending final certification of his special runoff victory to serve out the rest of the late Rep. Sylvester Turner’s term. Once Menefee joins the House, Johnson will have a single-vote buffer with 218 Republicans and 214 Democrats.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is confident Congress can end the partial government shutdown "by Tuesday" despite steep opposition from Democrats and turmoil within the GOP conference.</p> 
<p>Johnson is under pressure to unite his caucus, with lawmakers <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/government-shutdown-dhs-minnesota-00748628" target="_blank">raising concerns</a> about funding for the Department of Homeland Security as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/white-house-reckons-with-gop-backlash-after-federal-agents-kill-a-second-person-in-minneapolis-00746737" target="_blank">faces scrutiny</a> over its nationwide immigration crackdown that has at times turned violent.</p> 
<p>House Republicans are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/31/shutdown-tuesday-house-votes-00759001" target="_blank">hoping to take up</a> the $1.2 trillion funding package passed by the Senate on Tuesday following a House Rules Committee meeting Monday. The partial shutdown began early Saturday.</p> 
<p>GOP leadership in the House <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/30/congress/shutdown-house-spending-suspension-00758522" target="_blank">originally hoped to pass the bill</a> under suspension of the rules, an expedited process that requires a two-thirds-majority vote, but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told Johnson on Saturday that Democrats would not help Republicans acquire the necessary support for the spending bill.</p> 
<p>"I'm confident that we'll do it at least by Tuesday,” Johnson said in a Sunday interview on NBC's "Meet the Press.” “We have a logistical challenge of getting everyone in town, and because of the conversation I had with Hakeem Jeffries, I know that we've got to pass a rule and probably do this mostly on our own. I think that's very unfortunate."</p> 
<p>The Senate voted Friday to pass <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">a compromise spending package</a> after Senate Democrats struck a deal with President Donald Trump to extend DHS funding for two weeks. The move bought Congress more time to work out a compromise on reforms for Immigration and Customs Enforcement after federal officers <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minnesota-tim-walz-shooting-minneapolis-00745570" target="_blank">fatally shot</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/minneapolis-immigration-crackdown-shooting-00714034" target="_blank">two people</a> in Minnesota last month.</p> 
<p>Speaking to host Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press,” Johnson acknowledged that “there's been tragedies in Minnesota” — but he also blamed Democrats in the state for “inciting violence,” even as the Trump administration attempts to tamp down pressures in the state.</p> 
<p>Johnson praised <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/trump-border-czar-minneapolis-00746125" target="_blank">Trump’s decision to send</a> White House border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis, a step <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/26/congress/tom-homan-gop-support-00746206" target="_blank">widely seen as a deescalation</a> from the aggressive tactics favored by Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.</p> 
<p>“[Trump] was right to deputize him over that situation,” he said of Homan on NBC. “He has 40 years of experience in Border Patrol and these issues. So I think that this is going to happen, but we need good faith on both sides. Some of these conditions and requests that they've made are obviously reasonable and should happen. But others are going to require a lot more negotiation.”</p> 
<p>Johnson pushed back in particular on Democratic calls to bar federal immigration enforcement officers from wearing masks and require them to wear identification, telling Fox's Shannon Bream: “Those two things are conditions that would create further danger.” </p> 
<p>He also signaled an unwillingness to negotiate on Democratic demands to tighten requirements for judicial warrants for immigration operations.</p> 
<p>Still, House Democrats remained opposed to passing the funding package as is, with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) saying Sunday: “I'm not just a no. I'm a firm no.”</p> 
<p>“I just don't see how in good conscience Democrats can vote for continuing ICE funding when they're killing American citizens, when there's no provision to repeal the tripling of the budget,” Khanna said in a Sunday interview with Welker on NBC. “I hope my colleagues will say no.”</p> 
<p>Jeffries also signaled Sunday that a wide gap remains between his conference and House Republicans, telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that the House must reach an agreement on judicial warrants “as a condition of moving forward."</p> 
<p>“The one thing that we've said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,” Jeffries said on ABC’s “This Week.” “The administration can't just talk the talk, they need to walk the walk. That should begin today. Not in two weeks, today.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The partial government shutdown that began early Saturday morning is on track to continue at least into Tuesday, which is the earliest the House is now expected to vote on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">$1.2 trillion funding package</a> due to opposition from Democrats and internal GOP strife.</p> 
<p>House Republican leaders have scheduled a Monday meeting of the House Rules Committee to prepare the massive <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">Senate-passed spending bill</a> for the floor. According to two people granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, the procedural measure teeing up a final vote would not happen until Tuesday, with final passage following if that is successful.</p> 
<p>That's one day later than GOP leaders had hoped. Their previous plan was to pass the bill with Democratic help under suspension of the rules, a fast-track process requiring a two-thirds-majority vote.</p> 
<p>But that plan was complicated by Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> telling Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> in a private conversation Saturday that Democratic leadership would not help Johnson secure the 70 or so Democratic votes to get the measure over the line, according to the two people and another person granted anonymity to discuss the matter.</p> 
<p>The Tuesday plan remains tentative as GOP leaders scramble to navigate tensions inside their own conference, which could make passing the procedural measure difficult. Some conservative hard-liners, for instance, want to <a href="https://x.com/repluna/status/2017776647424913616?s=46" target="_blank">attach a sweeping elections bill</a> to the package.</p> 
<p>Jeffries said in a MS NOW interview Saturday that Republicans "cannot simply move forward with legislation taking a my way or the highway approach" while noting that House Democrats are set to have "a discussion about the appropriate way forward" in a Sunday evening caucus call — first reported by POLITICO.</p> 
<p>He did not rule out that Democrats might support the Senate-passed spending package, which funds the majority of federal agencies through Sept. 30 while providing a two-week extension for the Department of Homeland Security — including controversial immigration enforcement agencies.</p> 
<p>Democrats, Jeffries said, want "a robust, ironclad path to bringing about the type of change that the American people are demanding" in immigration enforcement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government funding is set to lapse at midnight Friday for the military and many domestic programs, but cash will continue to flow at a slew of federal agencies Congress already funded.</p> 
<p>House leaders are aiming to send a funding package to President Donald Trump Monday, days after the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">Senate passed the legislation</a> just before the deadline to avert a partial shutdown. </p> 
<p>The effect on most federal programs is expected to be minor, and employees who are furloughed would miss just one day of work if the House acts on schedule — <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/30/congress/shutdown-house-spending-suspension-00758522" target="_blank">which is not assured</a>.</p> 
<p>This time, many of the services that have the greatest public impact when shuttered — like farm loans, SNAP food assistance to low-income households and upkeep at national parks — will continue. That’s because Congress already funded some agencies in November and earlier this month, including the departments of Energy, Commerce, Justice, Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs, as well as military construction projects, the EPA, congressional operations, the FDA and federal science programs.</p> 
<p>Still, the spending package congressional leaders are trying to clear for Trump’s signature next week contains the vast majority of the funding Congress approves each year to run federal programs, including $839 billion for the military.</p> 
<p>Besides the Pentagon, funding will lapse for several major non-defense agencies beginning early Saturday morning. </p> 
<p>That includes federal transportation, labor, housing, education and health programs, along with the IRS, independent trade agencies and foreign aid. The departments of Homeland Security, State and Treasury will also be hit by the shutdown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate passed a compromise spending package Friday, clearing a path for Congress to avert a lengthy government shutdown.</p> 
<p>The 71-29 vote came a day after Senate Democrats and President Donald Trump struck a deal to attach two weeks of Homeland Security funding to <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">five spending bills</a> that will fund the Pentagon, State Department and many other agencies until Sept. 30.</p> 
<p>Only five of 53 Republicans voted against it after Trump publicly urged lawmakers Thursday to approve the legislation. Democrats were split, with 24 of 47 caucus members opposing the package.</p> 
<p>The Senate’s vote won’t avert a partial shutdown that will start early Saturday morning since House lawmakers are out of town and not scheduled to return until Monday.</p> 
<p>During a private call with House Republicans Friday, Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> said <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/30/congress/shutdown-house-spending-suspension-00758522" target="_blank">the likeliest route to House passage</a> would be bringing the package up under a fast-track process Monday evening. That would require a two-thirds majority — and a significant number of Democratic votes.</p> 
<p>The $1.2 trillion package could face challenges in the House, especially from conservative hard-liners who have said they would vote against any Senate changes to what the House already passed. Many House Democrats are also wary of stopgap funding for DHS, which would keep ICE and Border Patrol funded at current levels without immediate new restrictions.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> said he had been in constant contact with Johnson “for better or worse” about getting the funding deal through the House, predicting that the Louisiana Republican is “prepared to do everything he can as quickly as possible.”</p> 
<p>“Hopefully things go well over there,” he added.</p> 
<p>If the Trump-blessed deal ultimately gets signed into law, Congress will have approved more than 95 percent of federal funding — leaving only a full-year DHS bill on its to-do list. Congress has already funded several agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs and Justice.</p> 
<p>“These are fiscally responsible bills that reflect months of hard work and deliberation from members on both parties and both sides of the Capitol,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51168" data-person-id="51168">Susan Collins</a> (R-Maine) said before the final vote.</p> 
<p>The Office of Management and Budget has issued shutdown guidance for agencies not already funded, which include furloughs of some personnel.</p> 
<p>Republicans agreeing to strip out the full-year DHS bill and replace it with a two-week patch is a major win for Democrats. They quickly unified behind a demand to split off and renegotiate immigration enforcement funding after federal agents deployed to Minnesota fatally shot 37-year-old U.S. citizen Alex Pretti last week.</p> 
<p>Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a>, who helped negotiate the final deal, took a victory lap after the vote, saying “the agreement we reached today did exactly what Democrats wanted.”</p> 
<p>But Democrats will still need to negotiate with the White House and congressional Republicans about what, if any, policy changes they are willing to codify into law as part of a long-term bill. Republicans are open to some changes, including requiring independent investigations. But they’ve already dismissed some of Democrats’ main demands, including requiring judicial warrants for immigration arrests.</p> 
<p>“I want my Republican colleagues to listen closely: Senate Democrats will not support a DHS bill unless it reins in ICE and ends the violence,” Schumer said. “We will know soon enough if your colleagues understand the stakes.”</p> 
<p>Republicans have demands of their own, and many believe the most likely outcome is that another DHS patch will be needed.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51186" data-person-id="51186">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.), for instance, wants a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/30/congress/lindsey-graham-amendments-funding-00757533" target="_blank">future vote on legislation</a> barring federal funding for cities that don’t comply with federal immigration laws. Other Republicans and the White House have pointed to it as a key issue in the upcoming negotiations.</p> 
<p>“I am demanding that my solution to fixing sanctuary cities at least have a vote. You're going to put ideas on the floor to make ICE better? I want to put an idea on the floor to get to the root cause of the problem,” Graham said.</p> 
<p>The Senate vote caps off a days-long sprint to avoid a second lengthy shutdown in the span of four months. Senate Democrats and Trump said Thursday they had a deal, only for it to run into a snag when Graham delayed a quick vote as he fumed over a provision in the bill, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/29/congress/senate-poised-to-repeal-payout-provision-00756723" target="_blank">first reported by POLITICO</a>, related to former special counsel Jack Smith’s now-defunct investigation targeting Trump.</p> 
<p>Senate leaders ultimately got the agreement back on track Friday afternoon by offering votes on seven changes to the bill, all of which failed. The Senate defeated proposals to cut refugee assistance, strip out all earmarks from the package and redirect funding for ICE to Medicaid, among others.</p> 
<p>Graham raged against the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/22/congress/house-votes-to-kill-senate-data-seizure-payouts-00740925" target="_blank">House’s move to overturn</a> a law passed last year allowing senators to sue for up to $500,000 per incident if their data had been used in former special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into the 2020 election. But he backed off his threats to hold up the bill after announcing that leaders had agreed to support a future vote on the matter.</p> 
<p>“You jammed me,” Graham said on the floor Friday. “Speaker Johnson, I won't forget this.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> told House Republicans on a private call Friday night he intends to hold a vote on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">sprawling funding package</a> by Monday evening. Leaders are likely to pursue a bipartisan path for passage, he said, rather than relying on the thin GOP majority to approve it.</p> 
<p>The planned vote would end a partial government shutdown after more than two days. The Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">passed the package</a> Friday night, just ahead of a midnight shutdown deadline, but the House has been in recess this week and is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday.</p> 
<p>The vote would happen Monday by 6:30 p.m., Johnson said, according to four people granted anonymity to describe his private remarks. He added he intended to pass it however he could, the people said, but indicated the likeliest route would be bringing it up under suspension of the rules, a fast-track process that requires a two-thirds majority — and hence a significant chunk of Democratic votes.</p> 
<p>The suspension path would avoid a potentially tricky party-line procedural vote, with many conservative hard-liners raising objections to reopening a Homeland Security funding deal — as the Senate bill would do. The House Rules Committee had planned to meet Sunday night and hasn't yet notified members those plans had changed, but Republicans say it is likely.</p> 
<p>House Democrats have been wary of providing any support for the Department of Homeland Security amid President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement surge, and it could be difficult for party leaders to summon the scores of votes needed to pass the deal, which was negotiated between Senate Democrats and the White House.</p> 
<p>The agreement splits off DHS funding from the larger package but still funds the department for two more weeks, allowing time for negotiations on new enforcement restrictions.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> indicated there was no agreement between Democratic and Republican leaders about providing votes for the funding bill. The caucus is likely to be sharply divided on the question, many Democrats say privately. Just over half of Senate Democratic Caucus members — 24 of 47 — voted against the package Friday, most over the DHS funding.</p> 
<p>House Democrats are expected to hold a Sunday evening caucus call to discuss the vote, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of a formal announcement.</p> 
<p>Jeffries has been publicly aligned with Senate Democratic leaders on a push for stronger warrant requirements, banning agents from wearing masks and requiring them to use body cameras. He said in a statement Friday that House Democrats would "evaluate the spending legislation passed by the Senate on its merits and then decide how to proceed legislatively."</p> 
<p>He called on the Trump administration to "set forth an ironclad path that dramatically reforms ICE and other DHS agencies that the American people know have become lawless and heavy-handed" and said it would "in the best interest of the country that this is done before the Congress reconvenes on Monday evening."</p> 
<p>Johnson on the call emphasized that Trump supports the deal, and the House needs to pass it. GOP leaders also pressed members to get into Washington as soon as Sunday night.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham laid out a path to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/30/congress/shutdown-deal-lindsey-graham-dhs-00756840" target="_blank">pass a funding deal Friday</a>, potentially defusing a standoff that threatens to extend a potential government shutdown set to begin within hours.</p> 
<p>Senate Republican leaders believe they can move forward with approval of the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">spending agreement</a> notched by President Donald Trump and Senate Democrats by arranging for future votes demanded by the South Carolina Republican — one on legislation addressing cities that don’t comply with federal immigration laws and two others related to the defunct investigation into the 2020 election led by former special counsel Jack Smith.</p> 
<p>Graham signaled during a floor speech Friday that he could settle for the votes at a later date, instead of as part of the pending spending bill. A spokesperson said Graham is not asking for votes today. </p> 
<p>Senate Republican leaders believe they can move forward with approval of the spending agreement notched by President Donald Trump and Senate Democrats by offering votes on amendments demanded by the South Carolina Republican — one related to cities that don’t comply with federal immigration laws and two changes related to the defunct investigation into the 2020 election led by former special counsel Jack Smith.</p> 
<p>Giving Graham those amendment votes would require sign-on from all 99 of his colleagues.</p> 
<p>“I'm asking this body to guarantee me that vote, and we move forward,” Graham said about his sanctuary cities proposal.</p> 
<p>Addressing the Smith language, which would have allowed senators to sue for up to $500,000 per incident in damages, Graham said he wants the Senate to vote on substitute language expanding who can sue if their phone records are seized and requiring notification when senators are impacted.</p> 
<p>"We'll fix the $500,000 — count me in — but you took the notification out,” Graham said. “I am demanding a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”</p> 
<p>The apparent pathway to Senate passage represents a reversal from Thursday night, when the chamber appeared stuck after Graham railed against the spending bill as a “bad deal” and vowed to block its speedy approval.</p> 
<p>While there were multiple resolved sticking points as of Thursday night, Graham’s objections were widely viewed as the main obstacle.</p> 
<p>Graham’s rebellion is tied to the spending legislation including a House-passed provision undoing a law allowing senators to receive cash payouts if they had their phone records seized by Smith’s investigation.</p> 
<p>The provision’s inclusion in the Senate funding agreement <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/29/congress/senate-poised-to-repeal-payout-provision-00756723" target="_blank">was first reported by POLITICO</a>.</p> 
<p>Graham, who was among the senators who had records subpoenaed, railed against the provision on Thursday night — though he argued his interest was not personal.</p> 
<p>“It’s not about me — 190 private groups had their phone records messed with. I want notification,” Graham said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and state Attorney General Keith Ellison will testify March 4 before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.</p> 
<p>The announcement of their joint appearance by by Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) is the latest development in his panel's investigation into welfare fraud in Minnesota, a scandal that has become a rallying cry for Republicans amid the administration’s highly controversial immigration operation in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>“We look forward to questioning Governor Walz and Attorney General Ellison under oath about this scandal to ensure transparency and accountability for the American people, and to advance solutions to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse and impose stronger penalties on those who defraud taxpayers,” Comer, who threatened to subpoena both men earlier this month, said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Walz, the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president who recently announced he would not seek reelection to continue serving as his state's chief executive, last testified before Comer’s panel this past June alongside other Democratic governors about their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement activities.</p> 
<p>Ellison is a former Democratic member of Congress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Capitol agenda: Senate shutdown deal hits a Lindsey Graham snag</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A partial shutdown of multiple federal agencies is just 16 hours away as the Senate deals with a Lindsey Graham-sized snag and House Republicans face pressure from President Donald Trump to expedite whatever the other chamber sends their way.</p> 
<p>Here’s the latest on the stop-start drama around the government funding deal:</p> 
<p><b>— Graham's revenge:</b> It sure seemed like the Senate was ready to vote Thursday night after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/shutdown-spending-deal-trump-00756372" target="_blank">Trump and Democrats struck a compromise</a> — enactment of five of the full-year appropriations bills and a two-week Homeland Security stopgap — to buy time for both sides to negotiate new guardrails for the administration’s immigration enforcement activities after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>Then Graham made his move. He refused to go along with the plan <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/29/congress/senate-poised-to-repeal-payout-provision-00756723" target="_blank">over a House-backed provision</a> that would repeal a law allowing senators to receive cash payouts if they had phone records seized by former special counsel Jack Smith — the South Carolina Republican included.</p> 
<p>The Senate could move ahead as soon as Friday, though there are currently no votes on the schedule as leadership works to resolve holdups. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said there were issues coming from members of both parties, though Graham appears to be the main problem.</p> 
<p>“Hopefully by sometime tomorrow we’ll be in a better spot,” Thune said leaving the Capitol Thursday night. “Tomorrow’s another day, and hopefully people will be in a spirit to try and get this done.”</p> 
<p><b>— What's next in the House:</b> Assuming the Senate can send a funding package across the Capitol in short order, House GOP leaders are planning for a vote in their chamber as soon as Monday. Though if Trump wants a shorter partial shutdown, he could pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to call his members back earlier.</p> 
<p>The full House GOP conference will hold a call at 4:30 p.m., after postponing from 11 a.m. Leaders are expected to try and rally support, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss private plans. </p> 
<p>They’re likely to get an earful from hard-liners, who opposed separating DHS out from the larger funding package from the start and don’t want to negotiate with Democrats on restricting Trump’s deportation agenda.</p> 
<p>Other Republicans could cause problems with their own eleventh-hour wish lists. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is insisting the House amend the appropriations package to tack on the SAVE America Act, which would require proof of citizenship when registering to vote. That would require sending the funding legislation back to the Senate yet again, further prolonging a shutdown.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders were already talking with some House Republican factions Thursday night about the funding deal in an effort to get members on board ahead of what’s expected to be a party-line procedural rule vote — and they’ll soon only have a one-vote margin majority.</p> 
<p>If enough hard-liners hold up the bill during that vote, GOP leaders might look to pass it via suspension, which requires a two-thirds affirmative vote of members present.</p> 
<p><b>— What that means for the DHS bill:</b> Should the DHS stopgap make its way to Trump, two weeks could prove to be a tight window to sort through a host of tough asks from members who want to put their stamp on the full-year funding bill. Graham, for instance, is pushing for his bill to end sanctuary cities to be included in the revamped DHS measure.</p> 
<p>Some Republicans are bracing for the possibility of another weekslong funding patch for DHS if a deal isn’t reached by mid-February, with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) predicting that “part of the government is just going to stay shut down” indefinitely.</p> 
<p>But Republicans’ biggest fear is it could all end with Democrats jamming the GOP with their demands, which include tighter warrant rules, a ban on masks and a requirement for body cameras and independent investigations.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Johnson’s margin narrows: </b>This Saturday’s special election runoff in Texas between two Democrats vying to fill the seat left vacant by late-Rep. Sylvester Turner will cut further into Johnson’s already-tiny margin — and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is warning the speaker not to delay the winner's swearing-in.</p> 
<p>Whoever wins the seat — either Amanda Edwards or Christian Menefee — will, once seated, bring the balance of the House to 218-214. When that happens, Johnson will only be able to afford a single defection on party-line votes, which could be especially critical next week assuming government funding legislation heads back to the House.</p>

      <title>Senate expected to repeal law allowing lawmakers to sue over data seizures</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate is expected to swallow a House-passed provision that would nix a law that allows senators to receive cash payouts if they had their phone records seized by former special counsel Jack Smith.</p> 
<p>Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview Thursday night he currently anticipates the repeal language to remain a part of the government funding package the Senate hopes to pass in the coming hours, but which has not yet been unveiled.</p> 
<p>A second person granted anonymity to disclose private discussions confirmed that the House provision is likely to be preserved. A third person, a Senate aide, also said the expectation is that the House language stays in.</p> 
<p>It goes back to the spending agreement Congress cleared last November to end the record-breaking government shutdown. At that time, the Senate quietly inserted a new policy into the legislation which would have the effect of allowing certain Republican senators to sue the federal government for hundreds of thousands of dollars if they had their electronic records seized without prior notification during Smith’s 2021 probe of President Donald Trump’s attempts to subvert the results of the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>House members of both parties <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/house-votes-to-overturn-thunes-controversial-subpoena-measure-00661169" target="_blank">were horrified</a> by the language, which they learned about only after the fact, and quickly passed legislation unanimously to undo it. They took steps last week to tuck that repeal into a separate, six-bill government funding package the Senate will need to pass before the end of the day Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p> 
<p>But now the chamber is preparing to strip out the Homeland Security appropriations bill to negotiate new provisions around immigration enforcement activities and pass the other five, and it has been an open question throughout the day Thursday whether the repeal provision would remain intact.</p> 
<p>While the funding agreement hasn’t been announced yet on the Senate floor — meaning it could still change as leaders try to wrangle holdouts, whose blessing they need in order to speed up a passage vote before the shutdown deadline — senators were sending signals that there was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/senate-gop-split-over-how-to-amend-the-jack-smith-phone-data-measure-00660149" target="_blank">a bipartisan appetite to keep it.</a></p> 
<p>“I think it was politically tone deaf to put a monetary penalty in there,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has been leading the charge to re-investigate the work of Smith’s office.</p> 
<p>Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who had expressed frustration that he was not consulted on the initial measure as ranking member of the relevant appropriations subcommittee, said he would advocate for the repeal provision to be included in any funding bill the Senate considers this week.</p> 
<p>“I think it should be part of anything we vote on,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump and Senate Democrats reached an agreement to fund the federal government as a Friday midnight deadline for a partial shutdown approaches.</p> 
<p>But the Senate’s hopes of quickly passing the deal, text of which is yet to be unveiled, ran into a snag Thursday night, with leadership sending senators home around 11 p.m. Senators hope to pass the deal Friday, but votes aren’t yet scheduled.</p> 
<p>“Hopefully by sometime tomorrow we’ll be in a better spot,” Majority Leader John Thune said as he left the Capitol. “Tomorrow’s another day, and hopefully people will be in a spirit to try and get this done tomorrow.”</p> 
<p>Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was more blunt: “Republicans need to get their act together.”</p> 
<p>Thune said there were unresolved issues on both sides of the aisle. But the main sticking point appears to be Sen. Lindsey Graham’s decision to block a quick vote on the deal because it includes a House-passed provision undoing a law that allows senators to receive cash payouts if they had their phone records seized by former special counsel Jack Smith.</p> 
<p>The provision’s inclusion in the Senate funding agreement <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/29/congress/senate-poised-to-repeal-payout-provision-00756723" target="_blank">was first reported by POLITICO</a>.</p> 
<p>Graham (R-S.C.), who was among the senators who had records subpoenaed, said Thursday night his interest was not personal: “It’s not about me — 190 private groups had their phone records messed with. I want notification.” Graham’s objection comes even after Trump urged support for the agreement.</p> 
<p>"I am working hard with Congress to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay," Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115980912926614287" target="_blank">posted on Truth Social</a>. "Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan 'YES' Vote."</p> 
<p>Even if the Senate passes the deal Friday, a partial government shutdown could still happen early Saturday morning, since the House is in recess and not scheduled to return until Monday. Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://x.com/ZachSchermele/status/2017028033408897052" target="_blank">said at an event Thursday night</a> that is the earliest the House could vote, though House Republicans will hold a conference call Friday morning where leaders could recalibrate.</p> 
<p>Leadership aides reiterated after Trump’s announcement that they still expect the earliest they will be able to hold votes on the agreement is next week, which would guarantee a brief partial shutdown.</p> 
<p>Stripping the full-year DHS bill out of the larger six-bill package is a victory for Senate Democrats, who are unified behind demands for enforcement policy changes after federal agents deployed to Minnesota fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti last week.</p> 
<p>But Democratic leaders are still in negotiations with the White House over exactly what <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/28/congress/democrats-dhs-minnesota-shutdown-00753256" target="_blank">policy changes</a> they want signed into law in return for their support for a long-term bill. Though Republicans have signaled they are open to some of the ideas Democrats have proposed, including requiring independent investigations, some in the GOP are raising warning flags about a fight to come.</p> 
<p>Graham told reporters Thursday that while he was “willing to entertain some reforms … the cancer that we're dealing with is sanctuary-city policy.” He wants a vote on legislation cracking down on those jurisdictions that don’t comply with federal immigration laws, an idea Trump also backed this month.</p> 
<p>Republicans are already bracing for the possibility of another weeks-long stopgap for DHS if a deal isn’t reached by mid-February. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) went further, predicting that after the two-week stopgap “part of the government is just going to stay shut down.”</p> 
<p>If Thursday’s deal is enacted, Congress will have approved full-year funding for more than 95 percent of the agencies it funds on an annual basis — leaving unfinished only the DHS spending measure.</p> 
<p>If the package isn’t enacted before the Friday night deadline, a shutdown will hit all federal agencies that weren’t covered in the six funding bills Congress already enacted for the current fiscal year.</p> 
<p>Agencies already funded include the departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, Justice, Interior, Commerce and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs, federal science initiatives, the FDA and the operations of Congress itself.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A panel of House lawmakers found “substantial evidence” that Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/314122" data-person-id="314122">Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick</a>, who's facing federal fraud charges, committed conduct outlined in the indictment against her.</p> 
<p>The investigative subcommittee under House Ethics found violations of campaign finance laws and regulations; criminal laws; the Ethics in Government Act; the Code of Ethics for Government Service; and House rules. The Florida Democrat <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/florida-democrat-indicted-on-federal-fraud-charges-00661162" target="_blank">has already been indicted</a> for siphoning FEMA funds for her campaign, taking part in a straw donor scheme and tax fraud.</p> 
<p>“The ISC’s investigation has revealed substantial evidence of conduct consistent with the allegations in the indictment, as well as more extensive misconduct as laid out in the following Statement of Facts in Support of Alleged Violations related to violations of federal laws and regulations, as well as ethical standards,” a report from the investigative subcommittee stated.</p> 
<p>A lawyer for Cherfilus-McCormick, Michael Stroud, responded to panel lawmakers by requesting that they pause their proceedings while the criminal case plays out and dismiss the investigation that began in June.</p> 
<p>“Representative Cherfilus-McCormick disputes and refutes the allegations and report of the Ethics Committee’s Investigative Subcommittee,” Stroud wrote to the panel.</p> 
<p>Stroud did not immediately return a request for comment. </p> 
<p>The subcommittee reviewed over 33,000 documents, conducted dozens of interviews, issued 59 subpoenas and met 12 times. Although initially cooperative, Cherfilus-McCormick ultimately invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p> 
<p>An adjudicatory subcommittee will hold a hearing in her case in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the No. 3 Democratic Party leader, made her <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/amy-klobuchar-minnesota-governor-00754285" target="_blank">bid for Minnesota governor</a> official Thursday morning, presaging a leadership shakeup in the caucus.</p> 
<p>Klobuchar was viewed as a potential contender to succeed Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin as Democratic whip after Durbin — who has held the No. 2 position for two decades — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/dick-durbin-retiring-from-senate-illinois-00305833" target="_blank">announced his retirement</a> last year.</p> 
<p>But Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii moved quickly to lock down support to succeed Durbin, and Klobuchar never threw her name in. Even so, she was seen as a credible successor to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is planning to run again for leader but has faced calls to step down from outside the caucus.</p> 
<p>Klobuchar’s announcement comes amid a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/senators-block-funding-package-amid-dhs-standoff-00754927" target="_blank">fight on Capitol Hill</a> about President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement agenda in her home state. The killing of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis has thrown federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security into question ahead of a Friday midnight shutdown deadline.</p> 
<p>With the funding fight in full swing and the internal leadership election not taking place until after the November elections, other Democratic leaders aren’t yet jumping to declare their interest in moving up the ranks.</p> 
<p>“Let’s talk about it after,” Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, the No. 4 Democratic leader, told reporters Thursday. “I am really just focused on an agency out of control.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, another member of Senate leadership and the top Democrat on the Homeland Security funding panel, said he isn’t focused on how leadership ranks will shift.</p> 
<p>“We got other big things we’re doing today,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kazmierczak apparently responded, “She’s not resigning. You’re splitting Minnesotans apart,” according to video evidence reviewed by the FBI.</p> 
<p>Kazmierczak was tackled by two security guards and later arrested by the Minneapolis Police Department. During his initial court appearance on Thursday, Kazmierczak was ordered detained pending a detention hearing on Feb. 3.</p> 
<p>A hazardous materials specialist later identified the substance from the syringe as water and apple cider vinegar, with Kazmierczak allegedly admitting to squirting Omar with vinegar at the time of his arrest, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.231039/gov.uscourts.mnd.231039.1.1.pdf" target="_blank">an affidavit</a>.</p> 
<p>At a Wednesday press conference, Omar — who has been a frequent target of Donald Trump's criticism — blamed the president for threats against her.</p> 
<p>“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” she said.</p> 
<p>The attack came less than a week after Trump wrote in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115941130299210878" target="_blank">a social media post</a> that Omar “should be investigated for Financial and Political Crimes, and that investigation should start, NOW!” Trump has criticized her many times on social media.</p> 
<p>Shortly after the incident, Trump reiterated his criticism of the Minnesota Democrat, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hints-relaxed-federal-tactics-minnesota-after-shootings/story?id=129626425" target="_blank">telling ABC News</a>: “I think she's a fraud.” He also alleged, without evidence, that Omar may have “had her herself sprayed.”</p> 
<p>Kazmierczak, who has been arrested twice for driving under the influence and was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, apparently told a close associate that “someone should kill” Omar several years ago, per the affidavit.</p> 
<p>He also has a history of pro-Trump social media activity. In one October 2021 Facebook post, he shared a political cartoon depicting Omar holding a sign that reads “Defund police” and saying: “Security for me, none for thee.” The cartoon also depicts a security officer holding a bag of money that reads: “Omar and the squad spent a combined $100,000 on security last quarter,” an apparent reference to the young progressive group of House Democrats.</p> 
<p>Kazmierczak also repeatedly posted in defense of Kyle Rittenhouse, the man who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/19/rittenhouse-not-guilty-in-kenosha-murder-case-523049" target="_blank">shot three people</a> — killing two — at a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight Republicans joined every Senate Democrat to block sweeping government funding legislation from advancing Thursday amid ongoing negotiations around a potential offramp to avert a lengthy shutdown of several agencies.</p> 
<p>The Senate voted 55-45 against moving forward with a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">six-bill package</a> that would fund, among other things, the departments of Homeland Security, State and Health and Human Services, as well as the Pentagon.</p> 
<p>The measure accounts for more than 75 percent of discretionary spending across the federal government, and programs relying on this money will shutter if Congress cannot reach a deal by 12:01 a.m. Saturday.</p> 
<p>The House already passed these bills, then left town for recess. The Senate was on track to clear them without much drama. But then came last weekend’s killing in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, at the hands of Border Patrol agents.</p> 
<p>The incident has fueled new scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement activities, including from some of President Donald Trump’s more reliable GOP allies on Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>Democrats now say they will oppose advancing the funding measure as long as <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7147" target="_blank">funding for DHS</a> is included — or until Republicans agree to legislation that would put new guardrails around ICE.</p> 
<p>The current DHS bill would reduce the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts but also hand ICE $10 billion for the remainder of the fiscal year. It would require DHS to use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on defusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide a separate $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.</p> 
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote Thursday that Democrats remain ready to pass the other five funding bills included in the package as he engages in discussions with the White House on what further changes could be made to the DHS bill to address Democrats’ concerns.</p> 
<p>The New York Democrat said “strong legislation to rein in ICE” is necessary.</p> 
<p>“Congress has to step up to the plate,” Schumer added. “The Republican majority must step up to the plate.”</p> 
<p>Democrats across Congress want rules tightened around the use of warrants and identification of DHS agents conducting immigration enforcement operations, among other things.</p> 
<p>Many of Democrats' requests for changing the DHS bill were pursued earlier in the process at the committee level, but didn’t have the support to make it into the bipartisan and bicameral compromise package.</p> 
<p>Republicans and Democrats are talking, according to a person granted anonymity to speak freely, but a deal is not done.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview Thursday before the doomed procedural vote that he believed the negotiations were “trending in the right direction.”</p> 
<p>After the vote went down, Thune moved to lay the groundwork to quickly bring the package back up if Democrats and the White House can reach a deal. He voted “no” to give himself the option to force reconsideration later.</p> 
<p>Republican Sens. Ted Budd of North Carolina, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rick Scott and Ashley Moody of Florida were the other GOP lawmakers who voted “no.” Some are seeking a potential opportunity to reshape the Department of Homeland Security funding bill; others are looking to secure further spending cuts.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, Congress appears likely to barrel over the shutdown cliff for at least some amount of time, as the House is out of town until Monday and hard-liners in that chamber have already vowed to complicate leadership’s ability to pass the funding bills a second time. House GOP leaders are set to meet later Thursday to discuss options, two people familiar with the private deliberations said.</p> 
<p>The other person granted anonymity to share details of private party dynamics said Democrats could be willing to shore up the votes for a short-term spending patch — as long as it is very brief for the sole purpose of allowing more time to close out negotiations on a new DHS bill.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans believe the administration is open to making changes to the House-passed DHS measure in the wake of the backlash over Pretti’s death. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins also announced Thursday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem had informed her that ICE had ended its enhanced operations in Maine at the Republican lawmaker’s request — another sign the White House could be ready to cooperate.</p> 
<p>Members of both parties want to move quickly. Though the congressional fight has been focused on immigration enforcement activities, the DHS bill also would fund the Coast Guard, FEMA, TSA and other critical agencies through Sept. 30.</p> 
<p>Some Democrats had raised concerns in particular about FEMA funding as a significant swath of the country continues to recover from a widespread winter storm from this past weekend.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines Thursday to advance a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_DRAFT19" target="_blank">landmark cryptocurrency bill</a>, sending the measure to the Senate floor without bipartisan backing.</p> 
<p>The committee voted 12-11 to advance so-called crypto market structure legislation, which would create new rules governing how digital tokens are regulated. The bill that the Ag panel approved Thursday, which would grant new crypto regulatory authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, would need to eventually be merged with a second part of the bill dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that falls under the Senate Banking Committee’s jurisdiction.</p> 
<p>The party-line vote came after months of negotiations between Ag Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51287" data-person-id="51287">John Boozman</a> (R-Ark.) and Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/211545" data-person-id="211545">Cory Booker</a> (D-N.J.) failed to yield a bipartisan deal. Boozman plowed ahead with a GOP-only bill, saying “there were fundamental policy disagreements” between the two sides and it is now “time to move this process forward.”</p> 
<p>“The CFTC is the right agency to regulate the spot trading of digital commodities,” he said in an opening statement. “At a high level, this bill provides a clear definition of a digital commodity, protects innovation and technology, establishes consumer protection safeguards, and equips the agency with the necessary resources to take on this new responsibility.”</p> 
<p>Booker, who is a member of a Senate Democratic working group that is negotiating with Republicans on the market structure bill, said Republicans were “walking away from the bipartisan process that produced” <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/11/senate-ag-releases-long-awaited-crypto-bill-draft-00641759" target="_blank">a Boozman-Booker discussion draft</a> last year.</p> 
<p>“That frustrates me because I see a bipartisan glide path to land this plane, to punch through the end zone,” Booker said.</p> 
<p>Boozman said that he remains “committed to continue working with” Democrats on the bill as it moves toward the floor, adding that “what we want is a bipartisan bill.”</p> 
<p>The panel voted down several amendments offered by Democrats along party lines, including a provision from Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/69394" data-person-id="69394">Michael Bennet</a> (D-Colo.) that would ban federal officials and their families from issuing or endorsing digital assets. Ethics issues have been a major sticking point in market structure negotiations, as Democrats have pressed for language targeting the Trump family’s crypto businesses.</p> 
<p>Republicans also voted to reject a pair of amendments from Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51180" data-person-id="51180">Dick Durbin</a> (D-Ill.) that would seek to crack down on crypto ATM fraud and ban some crypto firms from receiving a federal bailout, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As White House officials and Senate Democrats scramble to nail down a last-minute deal to salvage a massive spending package, an internal GOP battle is brewing in the House over whether to accept any compromise.</p> 
<p>At stake is whether a partial government shutdown set to kick off early Saturday morning would last just a few days or much longer. The House is in recess and currently not expected to reconvene until Monday.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders expect President Donald Trump will have to lean heavily on House Republicans to get any Senate-approved agreement through the other chamber. Earlier this week, conservative hard-liners <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/freedom-caucus-dhs-ultimatum-00749816" target="_blank">threatened to oppose</a> the potential plan — suggesting a shutdown could drag on for weeks if leaders aren’t careful.</p> 
<p>The Senate talks have revolved around splitting off Homeland Security funding from a larger six-bill package the House sent across the Capitol last week and passing a stopgap measure to keep DHS agencies open while additional strictures on immigration enforcement are negotiated.</p> 
<p>A White House official granted anonymity to comment on the pending negotiations said Trump “wants the government to remain open” and confirmed the administration is “working with both parties to ensure the American people don’t have to endure another shutdown.”</p> 
<p>Privately, some GOP hard-liners are open to the possibility of a DHS stopgap, according to three people granted anonymity to describe internal conversations, with one saying it was “not an automatic no.”</p> 
<p>But their support would depend on the length of the stopgap and whether any Democratic policies are included as part of the agreement. That person added that a two-week punt negotiators are discussing would be “ridiculous.” Ultra-conservatives would prefer one lasting six weeks or longer.</p> 
<p>Democrats want to move in the opposite direction, with Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/282320" data-person-id="282320">Tina Smith </a>of Minnesota <a href="https://x.com/SenTinaSmith/status/2016873883559686445" target="_blank">calling for a negotiation</a> of “days, not weeks.”</p> 
<p>In any scenario, GOP leaders will likely need Trump’s involvement to get the DHS stopgap and the remaining five bills passed in the House and signed into law, which would keep the vast majority of federal agencies — including the Pentagon — open through Sept. 30.</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson already is dealing with a razor-thin margin, and a special election in Texas over the weekend is expected to complicate matters. If the Democratic nominee wins as expected, Johnson could spare only a single defection on a party-line vote.</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders are set to discuss their plans Thursday afternoon, including whether they would need to call the House back earlier than currently planned Monday night, according to two other people granted anonymity to describe private deliberations. But that will depend on how quickly the Senate can pass any agreement.</p> 
<p>Another complication is that a huge swath of House Democrats would likely oppose stopgap funding for DHS, which would keep ICE and Border Patrol funded at current levels without immediate new restrictions. That could prevent GOP leaders from trying to pass the spending legislation on a bipartisan basis under suspension of the rules, which requires a two-thirds majority vote.</p> 
<p>On a caucus call Wednesday night, House Democrats aired concerns their Senate counterparts might accept a deal that does not put real guardrails on DHS agents, according to three people granted anonymity to describe the private meeting. Their leaders haven’t been included in the talks with the White House so far.</p> 
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday his caucus would "evaluate" whatever emerged out of the Senate on DHS funding and signaled they might settle for a stopgap funding bill for the agency while broader negotiations come together.</p> 
<p>"If we're on a path to a dramatic, immediate, transformative change, then I'm sure that will be a part of what heavily weighs into our discussion," he said.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a>, asked Thursday about how soon a potential agreement could get final House approval, said his “hope and expectation” is that the other chamber will do “what's necessary to keep the government funded.” He added that the House plan would be up to Johnson, whom he has spoken with, while acknowledging that having to abandon the six-bill package was “not ideal, for sure.”</p> 
<p>“We'd hoped to process all the six bills and send it to the White House, but we are where we are, and so we got to try and sort it out and get the best possible outcome given the hand we've been dealt,” Thune added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats and the White House are in intensive negotiations over how to avert an extended partial shutdown of the federal government that is set to start early Saturday morning.</p> 
<p>The two sides haven’t yet reached an agreement, according to a person granted anonymity to describe the private discussions.</p> 
<p>Even if Democrats and the White House reach an agreement, Congress is still expected to blow past the Friday midnight shutdown deadline, since the House is in recess until Monday and is not expected to reconvene earlier to ratify any changes to the six-bill funding package it sent to the Senate last week.</p> 
<p>The person with knowledge of the discussions characterized them as “ongoing and moving in Democrats’ direction.” A White House official granted anonymity to comment on the pending negotiations said Trump “wants the government to remain open” and confirmed the administration is “working with both parties to ensure the American people don’t have to endure another shutdown.”</p> 
<p>Democrats have unified behind a demand that Republicans agree to remove Department of Homeland Security funding from the six-bill package following the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis man, by federal agents Saturday.</p> 
<p>The Senate is set to vote on that package Thursday morning, with Democrats expected to block it absent an agreement with the White House. Were the Senate to agree on splitting apart the bills, it’s unclear if or how quickly the House could act to send them to President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>Democrats want to renegotiate the DHS bill to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/28/congress/democrats-dhs-minnesota-shutdown-00753256" target="_blank">include new restrictions and rules</a> for immigration enforcement activities, including tightening rules for warrants and requiring independent investigations.</p> 
<p>But Democrats are open to a “very-short term extension” of DHS funding in order to give Congress and the White House time to renegotiate the bill, the person added.</p> 
<p>White House border czar Tom Homan, who has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/white-house-banks-on-homan-to-help-avert-shutdown-00754083" target="_blank">tasked by Trump with overseeing the DHS enforcement operation</a> in Minnesota, is set to address reporters Thursday morning in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>Separately, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced early Thursday that ICE has ended its “enhanced activities” in Maine, citing a conversation with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p> 
<p>“There are currently no ongoing or planned large-scale ICE operations here,” Collins said.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Key crypto markup: </b>The Senate Agriculture Committee will mark up landmark cryptocurrency legislation at 10:30 a.m. The big question is whether any Democrats will back the so-called crypto market structure bill coming out of committee.</p> 
<p>Chair John Boozman (R-Ark.) negotiated for months over the proposal with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), but is moving forward with a GOP-only bill that doesn’t currently have any bipartisan backing. That could set the stage for a party-line vote Thursday — or Democrats could vote for it and push for further changes before it hits the floor.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rand Paul made his name as a gadfly preaching about the dangers of a tyrannical federal government. Now, after the killings of two Minnesota residents at the hands of Homeland Security agents, the Kentucky Republican has a chance to do something about it.</p> 
<p>The 63-year-old, who spent years on the outskirts of the party, is now at the center of the Senate’s response to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which have sparked new criticism of the administration’s immigration enforcement policies and raised <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-trump-administration-dueling-accounts-minneapolis-shooting-00745811?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">many of the same civil liberties</a> questions Paul has long been asking.</p> 
<p>As chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, he’s already forced a trio of top immigration officials to agree to testify, publicly criticized the administration’s response to the Pretti shooting and even raised the possibility Congress might step in if the administration refuses to conduct an independent investigation of that incident.</p> 
<p>“For people to have confidence in government and confidence in law enforcement … we have to be very honest,” Paul told reporters. “I don’t think anybody in America believes he was assaulting those officers, so we have to tell the truth.”</p> 
<p>But Paul — who is already in President Donald Trump’s doghouse as an inconsistent GOP ally — is still walking a fine line.</p> 
<p>He repeatedly refused this week to weigh in on if Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should leave the administration, saying he was “reserving judgment for now.” And he has also taken pains to separate himself from some of DHS’s most aggressive Democratic critics, telling reporters he is “for restoring trust in ICE” — not abolishing it.</p> 
<p>Were Noem to depart, Paul could find himself in an especially precarious position. As chair of the Homeland Security panel, he would essentially serve as gatekeeper for the confirmation of any replacement. A single Republican defection on the committee could block any Trump nominee who does not have Democratic support.</p> 
<p>Speaking to reporters, he connected his skepticism about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement practices to his longstanding ideological crusade.</p> 
<p>“I mean, it's something I've been concerned with the whole time I've been here,” he said. “What are the rights of individuals? Who can you kill? When can you kill them? What is war? What is not war? What is due process? When do you have Fourth Amendment protections? So all these things are incredibly important.”</p> 
<p>For now, it’s an open question as to how far he is willing to risk his political career to push back against Trump’s historically aggressive agenda — with GOP colleagues skeptical he would block a Cabinet pick.</p> 
<p>He might not have to go to such extremes. After Paul publicly questioned why the DHS agents involved in the Pretti shooting were still on the job Tuesday, the department announced Wednesday they had been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/minnesota-shooting-agents-leave-00753083" target="_blank">placed on leave</a> — though no steps have been publicly taken toward the independent probe the senator is seeking.</p> 
<p>While Paul’s skepticism of federal power, both domestically and abroad, has long made him suspect in the eyes of Trump loyalists, his decision to use his committee gavel to seek answers from DHS is earning support from fellow Republicans — many of whom are uneasy over the administration’s enforcement surge in Minnesota, even if they aren’t willing to go as far as Paul.</p> 
<p>“Terrible — I mean, this is why there needs to be a full investigation as the president said,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of the Homeland Security panel, told reporters earlier this week. “I’m a firm believer in qualified immunity for law enforcement, but qualified immunity isn’t total immunity.”</p> 
<p>Hawley added that the Feb. 12 hearing, under Paul’s direction, would be “thorough.”</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has disagreed plenty with his libertarian-leaning GOP colleague, also backed up Paul’s decision to have the hearing with the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p> 
<p>“I think it's important,” Thune said.</p> 
<p>Underscoring the unusual role Paul occupies in the Senate, Democrats also view him as a potential ally who might help them force answers out of top administration leaders. While the Kentucky Republican frequently clashes with Democrats, especially on fiscal matters, he’s teamed up in recent weeks on bipartisan efforts to check the president’s war and tariff powers.</p> 
<p>Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.), another member of the Homeland panel, praised Paul’s decision to call in the administration officials to testify.</p> 
<p>“We've had a number of other experiences where there have been issues that are very much on the people's minds, and Congress and colleagues have not called in the administration,” he said in an interview. “This is a good sign from his proactive nature.”</p> 
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also praised Paul as an example of a Republican who understands that “the American people demand truth and accountability right now.”</p> 
<p>Paul, however, is making clear his concerns about the administration’s response to Saturday’s shooting aren’t personal against Trump. And there are signs his orbit is treading lightly around the Minnesota crisis.</p> 
<p>After Pretti’s killing Saturday, Doug Stafford — Paul’s longtime chief strategist — <a href="https://x.com/adamwren/status/2015192154528731585" target="_blank">posted on X</a>, questioning why Border Patrol officers were in a city nowhere near the border and “when did it become illegal to carry a gun in America.” </p> 
<p>He later deleted the post. A spokesperson for Paul’s office did not respond to a request for comment on that decision.</p> 
<p>“[Paul is] not a partisan voice,” said Brian Darling, a lobbyist who previously worked for Paul in the Senate. “He’s somebody who is going to look at the issue and look at it from a conservative perspective. And look at it from the perspective of preserving liberty. That’s the way he analyzes issues.”</p> 
<p>In the case of the Minnesota shooting, Darling said Paul would not simply look the other way because of his Republican colleagues.</p> 
<p>“He’s not going to play team ball on an issue where he sees important issues like the Fourth Amendment, the Second Amendment at risk,” he added.</p> 
<p>Often a maverick among the Senate GOP, Paul was cast aside as the party crafted Trump’s landmark domestic policy bill last year. As Homeland chair, Paul had jurisdiction over one of the legislation’s central pillars — a surge in new spending on border security.</p> 
<p>But he clashed with the Trump administration and Senate leadership over how much to give the agencies in question. Members of his panel, at the time, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/20/rand-paul-trump-republican-border-00414101" target="_blank">suggested Paul was operating</a> without consulting his peers.</p> 
<p>His legislative text was rejected. Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has a history of butting heads with Paul, instead led the drafting of the language.</p> 
<p>As the fury mounted over Pretti’s killing Monday and Democrats started uniting around blocking funding for ICE, Paul offered a public reminder of how much funding the agency already had.</p> 
<p>“The Senate is debating another $10B for ICE. But Congress already locked in nearly $19B a year for four years,” he <a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/2015890857241579689" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “Even if this fails, ICE will still have about 87% more funding than last year.”</p>

      <title>Senate Democrats float DHS changes in shutdown stalemate</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats on Wednesday revealed the DHS restrictions they need in exchange for helping Republicans avert a shutdown Friday night, including the tightening of rules on warrants.</p> 
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outlined the asks after a closed-door caucus meeting, telling reporters that Democrats were united around “common sense and necessary policy goals.”</p> 
<p>The list – featuring several demands previously <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/government-shutdown-dhs-minnesota-00748628" target="_blank">reported by POLITICO</a> — also included a prohibition on agents using masks, mandates for body cameras and IDs and a “uniform code of conduct and accountability,” including requiring independent investigations of incidents like Saturday’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.</p> 
<p>“Republicans must work with Democrats to find legislative solutions,” Schumer said.</p> 
<p>Wednesday’s caucus meeting was the first time Senate Democrats had gathered in person and talked strategy since the killing of Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>The shooting and the initial response by top administration officials have fueled widespread calls for changes to the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement strategy. On Capitol Hill, it has upended the debate over government funding ahead of Friday’s midnight shutdown deadline.</p> 
<p>The Senate will vote Thursday on a six-bill package that would fund several departments, including DHS. But Democrats have demanded that Senate Majority Leader John Thune strip out the DHS bill and negotiate new policy changes for immigration agencies. Senators are widely expecting the bill to fail to advance Thursday, which would force them to pivot to a Plan B. </p> 
<p>“There has to be accountability,” Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said. “This is not like some wish list. This is like really practical, common sense stuff that would actually go a long way towards minimizing the harm that we’re seeing in Minnesota right now.”</p> 
<p>Republicans are loath to strip out the Department of Homeland Security bill because any changes to the funding package would require it to go back to the House, where GOP hardliners are already vowing to throw up roadblocks.</p> 
<p>Though talks have been ongoing between Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, Republicans have been waiting for Schumer to outline specifically what Democrats want.</p> 
<p>“There's been overtures and attempts to try to connect on what they want and then see if it's something the administration could accommodate without having to change the language of the bill,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters.</p> 
<p>But Schumer said the “White House has had no specific, concrete ideas.”</p> 
<p>Without a deal to pass the funding package as is, a partial government shutdown will start Saturday. Privately, Republicans are hoping if there is a partial shutdown that they would be able to negotiate an off-ramp by Monday or early next week.</p> 
<p>Republicans have floated that the administration could take executive actions to address some of Democrats' concerns.</p> 
<p>But Smith dismissed that Wednesday, adding, “If you believe that I’ve got a bridge.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Republicans set to make ‘best and final’ Obamacare offer, Moreno says</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GOP Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/398933" data-person-id="398933">Bernie Moreno</a> said that Republicans will make their “best and final” offer after weeks of bipartisan talks to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/07/congress/senate-deal-obamacare-subsidies-00714048" target="_blank">revive lapsed Obamacare subsidies</a>.</p> 
<p>“It’s going to be in the hands of the Democrats very shortly. … Here’s the exact thing that we think is the maximum we can sell our conference,” Moreno told reporters.</p> 
<p>“This would be it,” the Ohioan added. “This is the best and final” offer.</p> 
<p>Moreno is one of the lead GOP negotiators involved in months of talks about a potential two-year revival of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits that lapsed Jan. 1. The senators involved have discussed immediate new restrictions such as an income limit, as well as more sweeping changes kicking in the second year, including expanding the use of health savings accounts.</p> 
<p>Moreno separately told reporters the group is proposing to maintain the status quo on the Hyde amendment, which restricts the use of federal dollars on abortion services.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/197755" data-person-id="197755">Angus King</a> (I-Maine), who has been involved with the talks, appeared optimistic about the chances of a deal, telling reporters Wednesday he expected to receive text later in the day. The health care discussions have been largely back-burnered as Congress has spent recent weeks dealing with an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/government-shutdown-dhs-minnesota-00748628" target="_blank">approaching government shutdown deadline</a>.</p> 
<p>“I think we’re very close,” said King, who caucuses with Democrats. “We have a solid bipartisan group, and hopefully we can move the bill once we get through this budget situation.”</p> 
<p>But others involved in the negotiations have been surprised by Moreno’s comments about the impending release of a bill, noting that Democrats had not seen or signed off on anything yet, according to two people granted anonymity to speak candidly about the talks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration’s decision to work with the remnants of ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s regime on Wednesday, as Democrats raise questions about the timeline for elections and a transition to democracy in the South American petrostate.</p> 
<p>Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio reiterated previous statements that the ultimate goal in Venezuela is to restore democracy, but emphasized that the country needs to stabilize so that the opposition can actually participate in free and fair elections.</p> 
<p>“You can have elections, you have elections all day, but if the opposition has no access to the media, if opposition candidates are routinely dismissed and unable to be on the ballot because of the government, those aren't free and fair elections,” Rubio said. “That's the end state that we want: a free, fair, prosperous and friendly Venezuela. We're not going to get there in three weeks. It's going to take some time.”</p> 
<p>Rubio has consistently pushed the need for elections in Venezuela, though without giving a timeline. His comments suggest that a ballot could be well into the future. Some others inside the administration have argued that elections aren’t needed, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/05/trump-demands-venezuela-leader-00711728" target="_blank">as POLITICO has reported</a>.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump’s comments around U.S. access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and his praise of acting Venezuelan leader Delcy Rodriguez have raised questions about how much democracy in Venezuela is a priority for the administration.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Rodriguez, long an ally of Maduro who rose up the ranks in Caracas, has in recent days said her country will not take orders from Washington. Her comments have rankled the Venezuelan opposition and their friends in Washington, who already see the longtime regime official as an untrustworthy partner for the United States.</p> 
<p>Rubio’s comments Wednesday make clear the administration’s view that a pragmatic course is necessary to restore democracy in Venezuela. Rubio, who noted he’s meeting later Wednesday with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, said that the administration does want to see more progress towards stabilizing the country over the next few months.</p> 
<p>But Rubio reiterated that more steps need to be taken, including reopening the U.S. embassy in Caracas.</p> 
<p>“One thing is for me to pick up the phone and talk to Delcy Rodriguez three times a week,” Rubio said. “Another thing is to have someone on the ground on a daily basis that's following these events, is talking to civil society, but also engaging with interim authorities.”</p> 
<p>In the face of sharp questions from Democrats — who’ve argued Rodriguez staying in power reflects an impediment to a transition to democracy — Rubio also insisted that working with Rodriguez is a necessary step.</p> 
<p>“No one here is telling you this is what we want to see in the long term,” Rubio said. “Whether we like it or not, the elements of control in that country — the people with the guns, the people that control the guns and the institutions of government there — are in the hands of this regime.”</p> 
<p>It was the first time the secretary of State and acting national security adviser had spoken to lawmakers in a public hearing since the campaign against Venezuela began months ago. Republicans largely praised the operation and focused questions on the structures to open up access to Venezuela’s oil reserves.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats used that setting to criticize the administration for a lack of transparency around the military operations in Venezuela. Democrats had protested that only Republicans were directly briefed by Rubio in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 3 operation to capture Maduro — and that all briefings occurred after the operation had begun.</p> 
<p>“Consulting with Congress is not just some high-minded principle, not some abstract thing, not a nice-to-have. It's a got-to have,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151823" data-person-id="151823">Chris Coons</a> (D-Del.).</p> 
<p>Democrats and Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/175586" data-person-id="175586">Rick Scott</a> (R-Fla.) also raised questions about the timeline for future elections in Venezuela. The administration has not committed to a hard plan to see elections in the South American petrostate, but worries have mounted on both sides of the aisle that a long wait for elections may allow Rodriguez and the remnants of the Maduro regime to entrench their grip on power.</p> 
<p>The secretary of State, who served in the Senate for over a decade before his appointment, received a friendly welcome from Republicans, many of whom took pains to praise the operation and Rubio’s contributions to the administration. Senate Foreign Relations Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66832" data-person-id="66832">Jim Risch</a> (R-Idaho) said Americans were “lucky” to have Rubio as secretary of State. Others, meanwhile, focused their questions on efforts to expand U.S. access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.</p> 
<p>Still, Rubio faced some tough questioning from his former Republican colleagues. Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151828" data-person-id="151828">Rand Paul</a> (R-Ky.), critical of the campaign against Venezuela since the U.S. began striking alleged drug boats off Venezuelan waters, needled the secretary on the legal basis of the operation and whether Congress should have authorized it.</p> 
<p>Rubio responded that the short duration of the actual capture of Maduro, coupled with the fact that Maduro faced federal indictment in U.S. courts and was seen as the illegitimate leader of Venezuela, meant the operation did not reflect an act of war such that it would require congressional authorization.</p> 
<p>That answer did not satisfy Paul.</p> 
<p>“We’re in violation of both the spirit and the law of the constitution by bombing a capital, blockading a country and removing elected officials. And we certainly wouldn’t tolerate it, not would I, if someone did it to us,” Paul said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Capitol police report spike in threats made toward lawmakers in 2025</title>
      <link>https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/28/congress/congress-threats-rise-2025-00752137</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Threats toward members of Congress, their families, staff and the Capitol complex surged in 2025, according to the U.S. Capitol Police, with over 5,000 more incidents reported than the previous year.</p> 
<p>The police force’s Threat Assessment Section investigated 14,938 “concerning” statements, behaviors and communications, the agency <a href="https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2025" target="_blank">said in a news release this week</a>.</p> 
<p>It’s a sharp increase from 2024, when 9,474 threats were investigated by USCP. These threats — which include everything from social media posts to more direct targeting of lawmakers — mark the third year in a row that USCP has seen an increase in the number of threats made.</p> 
<p>As the number of incidents continues to rise, Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan said in a statement that USCP has been “strengthening” its partnerships with law enforcement agencies across the country so members can remain safe when they are away from Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>“We want to make sure agencies have the resources they need to be able to enhance protection, which is critical to the democratic process,” Sullivan said.</p> 
<p>In recent years, the nation has seen <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/09/12/charlie-kirk-political-violence-expert-analysis-00558638" target="_blank">an increase in political violence</a>, with some targeting members of Congress.</p> 
<p>On Tuesday, a man was arrested after charging Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and spraying her with an unknown substance <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/ilhan-omar-sprayed-minneapolis-00751540" target="_blank">during a town hall</a>.</p> 
<p>In September, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/10/charlie-kirk-tpusa-shot-00555826" target="_blank">killed while speaking at a college campus</a>. Last summer, a gunman <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/14/minnesota-lawmakers-targeted-shooting-00406125" target="_blank">shot two Minnesota state lawmakers,</a> killing one. Two months before that, an arsonist <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/14/josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-arson-attack-00288601" target="_blank">set fire to the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion</a> while Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside. And during the 2024 presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/15/trump-gunshots-florida-golf-club-00179228" target="_blank">a gunman shot President Donald Trump</a> at a political rally during an attempted assassination.</p> 
<p>USCP on Wednesday said one of the best ways to combat the number of threats facing legislators around the country is to decrease violent political rhetoric — a sentiment both Democrats and Republicans have been urging their counterparts to do each time violence breaks out.</p> 
<p>As Capitol Police continue to monitor threat assessments, the department has expanded its Protective Intelligence Operations Center, which launched in 2024 as a way to process reports regarding the safety of the legislators. The 24/7 center works with the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms to monitor members’ safety, the agency says.</p> 
<p>“We, and both Sergeant at Arms, are seeing an increase of reporting through our outreach efforts with the Congressional Community,” said Jeanita Mitchell, acting assistant chief of police for protective and intelligence operations.</p>]]></content:encoded>
