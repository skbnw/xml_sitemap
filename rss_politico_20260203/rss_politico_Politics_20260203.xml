      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tense Texas Democratic Senate primary has been roiled by yet another online firestorm after an influencer accused state Rep. James Talarico of calling a former opponent a “mediocre Black man” — a claim he said was a “mischaracterization of a private conversation.”</p> 
<p>The influencer, Morgan Thompson, who posts under the username @morga_tt on TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morga_tt/video/7602078773206338847" target="_blank"><u>posted the accusation in a video</u></a> on Sunday in which she claimed that Talarico told her in a private conversation after a Jan. 12 town hall in Plano, Texas, that he had “signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.” That reference was allegedly to former Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), who was in the Senate race until December, when he dropped out right before Rep. Jasmine Crockett joined. Both Allred and Crockett are Black; Talarico is white.</p> 
<p>Talarico pushed back on Thompson’s description of their conversation.</p> 
<p>“In my praise of Congresswoman Crockett, I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre – but his life and service are not. I would never attack him on the basis of race,” Talarico <u>said in the statement</u>.</p> 
<p>Thompson <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morga_tt/video/7602154339192360222" target="_blank">said in a <u>video</u> Monday</a> that she has no recording of the conversation but laid out evidence that she had been in contact with Talarico’s campaign to arrange it, including a photo of her standing with Talarico at the event, along with multiple texts she says were exchanged with an unnamed campaign staffer to plan the interaction. She had endorsed Talarico but said she now supports Crockett.</p> 
<p>In an interview with POLITICO before Talarico issued his statement, Thompson said she anticipated that not having a recording of the conversation with Talarico would raise skepticism of her account, but she still “felt like it was important enough to bring forward, given the nature of everything.” She declined to provide the name and contact information for that staffer so that POLITICO could verify their connection to the campaign.</p> 
<p>The alleged exchange threatens to upend a primary <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/15/talarico-crockett-texas-senate-primary-poll-00730929" target="_blank"><u>in which polls show voters are sharply dividing along racial lines</u></a>, <a href="https://texaspublicopinionresearch.substack.com/p/they-all-want-to-win-new-poll-shows" target="_blank"><u>with most Black voters supporting Crockett</u></a>, and majorities of white and Latino voters supporting Talarico.</p> 
<p>Allred fired back. “James, if you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don't do it while also tearing down a Black man,” he said in a video he <a href="https://x.com/ColinAllredTX/status/2018384625899294820" target="_blank"><u>posted</u></a> to Instagram on Monday.</p> 
<p>“When you make an accusation, you often have a bit of confession in it,” continued Allred, who is now running for Congress in the 33rd District against Rep. Julie Johnson (D-Texas). “Maybe you use the word mediocre because there was something creeping into your mind about yourself.”</p> 
<p>Crockett, in a statement, said that by posting his response video, Allred “drew a line in the sand.”</p> 
<p>“He made it clear that he did not take allegations of an attack on him as simply another day in the neighborhood, but more importantly, his post wasn’t about himself,” she said. “It was a moment that he decided to stand for all people who have been targeted and talked about in a demeaning way as our country continues to be divided.”</p> 
<p>Thompson said in the video that she had been offered the chance to talk to Talarico because she was unhappy that Talarico’s campaign had sent out fundraising messages from Democratic strategist James Carville given Carville’s calls for Democrats to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/opinion/democrats-platform-economic-rage.html" target="_blank"><u>move away from “woke” politics</u></a>. She had previously endorsed Talarico and said she worked with his campaign as part of its content creator outreach program but now supports Crockett.</p> 
<p>It’s the latest online explosion related to the primary. Last month, the hosts of popular podcast “Las Culturistas” urged people not to send money to Crockett because she had a history of “making it too obviously about” herself, a comment from host Matt Rogers that cohost Bowen Yang agreed with. That some of her supporters said the remarks were racist and misogynist, setting off off a fierce debate about what type of Democratic candidate can do well in red states like Texas. The hosts later apologized.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Allred, Sandhya Raghavan, said in a statement that his response to Talarico’s alleged remarks “speaks to a frustration that resonates far beyond this moment.”</p> 
<p>“When a former NFL player, civil rights attorney, and former congressman can be dismissed as ‘mediocre,’ it reveals the impossible standards Black candidates are held to,” she said. “Colin refused to accept that disrespect in silence — and in doing so, he stood up for every Black professional who has had their qualifications unfairly dismissed.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a nine-month stint helping run the FBI, former deputy director Dan Bongino is a podcaster once again.</p> 
<p>On Bongino’s first show back on Monday, President Donald Trump briefly dialed in, offering Bongino — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/dan-bongino-fbi-resignation-00696112" target="_blank">who resigned from the agency in December</a> — well wishes.</p> 
<p>But otherwise, the episode was more of a two-hour monologue that saw Bongino attempting to skewer old enemies — namely the mainstream media — and reconnect with the masses that launched his name, years ago, into the MAGA stratosphere.</p> 
<p>“The podfather is back,” he declared, “and I’m here to take back this movement.”</p> 
<p>Before joining the FBI last year, Bongino was a prolific right-wing podcaster who peddled in deep-state <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/dan-bongino-election-fraud-messaging-437164" target="_blank">conspiracy theories</a>. As the agency’s No. 2, working alongside the real-world powers he used to rail against, Bongino was often caught between his past digital footprint and his new job helping lead one of the nation’s premier law enforcement agencies. </p> 
<p>For years, he entertained <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5407856/conspiracy-theorists-dan-bongino-epstein-fbi" target="_blank">conspiracies about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s</a> death, dismissing the authorities’ claims that the late financier killed himself. Bongino built a fanbase by stoking these very fires — and angered many when, after joining the FBI, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/11/fbi-patel-bongino-epstein-files-00400434" target="_blank">he swiftly backtracked his rhetoric</a>. Online, some of Bongino’s former supporters have slammed him as a sellout.</p> 
<p>The show was a big moment for Bongino, whose tenure at the FBI was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/dan-bongino-weighs-resigning-fbi-heated-confrontation-pam-bondi-epstei-rcna218388" target="_blank">at times chaotic</a>. The show’s launch <a href="https://x.com/dbongino/status/2018409834249331010" target="_blank">included a Times Square billboard</a>, and opened with around 140,000 viewers — according to conservative video platform Rumble’s view count — and peaked at around 220,000.</p> 
<p>After a victory lap around the nation’s top law enforcement agency, Bongino is not returning to the friendliest audience. And he had some choice words for any critics.</p> 
<p>“I want to address the grifters out there who mistakenly thought I wasn’t coming back,” he said during the livestream. “This movement’s been hijacked by a small group of dipshits and bums and losers, who are nothing but doomers under the frame of accountability.”</p> 
<p>This was the throughline for much of the two-hour segment, which saw Bongino ripping into a number of his critics. “Get your lips and just pucker them up and plant a big wet one on my ass,” he told “the libs and their media pals.”</p> 
<p>The “dipshits” in media, he said, remain “totally divorced from reality.”</p> 
<p>And to alleged leakers at the FBI: “You guys destroyed the place, and you tried to destroy us too,” he said. “But I’m back now, and you can go fuck yourself.”</p> 
<p>Bongino, exhaling at the end of his minutes-long diatribe, smiles into the camera: “We’re so back. Aren’t we?”</p> 
<p>But unlike the first version of his podcast, Bongino largely shied away from conspiracy theories — except for when, 15 minutes into the show, his livestream abruptly cut off thanks to a technical glitch. </p> 
<p>“Rumble is under attack, this show is under attack, this is what these scumbags do,” he said. “Can’t have a voice like me speaking out.”</p> 
<p>“They just don’t want me to talk,” he repeated for the rest of the show.</p> 
<p>He also offered “behind the scenes” insights into his time at the FBI, defending himself against critics who misunderstood, he said, the decisions they made — including the agency’s handling of the Epstein files. </p> 
<p>“When you get selected for one of these principal or deputy positions, everything you do is a level 10 decision,” Bongino said. “Find out which one is the shittier decision and avoid it. That’s the best you can do.</p> 
<p>“Here’s the problem with the Epstein mess,” he continued. “The FBI doesn’t have the evidence many thought it did. … There were not tapes with powerful men raping kids. There was not a list. Epstein’s rolodex was already public. The files are largely unreleasable for many reasons.”</p> 
<p>The files didn’t contain the smoking gun people were expecting, Bongino said, but “this administration got you the information.”</p> 
<p>Near the end of the show, Trump — who hand-picked Bongino for his post last year — dialed in for a brief interview, where the two discussed the administration’s crime crackdown, Minnesota’s welfare fraud scandal and National Guard deployments.</p> 
<p>“I’ll tell you what, if I were a Democratic governor and I were in charge of Chicago, as an example, I would be begging Donald Trump to come,” Trump told Bongino.</p> 
<p>Trump took another chance to rail at the results of the 2020 election (“I won in a landslide,” he said), urging Republicans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/02/trump-nationalize-elections-2026-midterms-00760015" target="_blank">“nationalize the voting”&nbsp;and suggesting taking over voting “in&nbsp;at least 15&nbsp;places,”</a> which he didn’t name. And he patted himself on the back for his military actions in Iran and Venezuela, saying the U.S. is “respected again like never before.”</p> 
<p>“Listen, you did great in the FBI,” Trump told Bongino. “I’m very torn. I think, maybe, I’d rather have you where you are. “Very few people can do what you do, and your voice is a very important one.”</p> 
<p>Bongino, who has generally been a reliable supporter of Trump, intends to host his show every weekday. And for those expecting a Bongino chastened by his time in government — or those looking to take his space in the MAGA media sphere — he had a direct closing message.</p> 
<p>“All my bullshit detractors or whatever,” Bongino said at the end of the episode, “don’t know shit about anything. Throwing popcorn from the front row. We’re the number one livestream in the world. … I’m such a target that they came after the whole damn website. That’s how bad they want to keep me off the air.”</p> 
<p>“But I have my first — guys, you ready for this screenshot? — double barrel to those who tried to stop us,” he continued, silently flipping two middle fingers to the camera.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sen. Tina Smith is endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan as her successor over Rep. Angie Craig, taking sides in a hotly contested primary to fill Smith’s Senate seat that’s been roiled in recent weeks by the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.</p> 
<p>“Today, 3,000 federal agents are terrorizing our communities,” Smith said in a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/qYxv_Zhtqqs?feature=share" target="_blank"><u>video announcing her pick</u></a> that was shared first with POLITICO. “I know that right now there is no one that I trust more to stand with Minnesota than Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan.”</p> 
<p>Flanagan, in the video, called it an “honor” to have the retiring senator’s endorsement and pledged to “continue in her footsteps.”</p> 
<p>“We’re going to push back against the status quo and send a progressive fighter to continue representing us in Washington, D.C.,” Flanagan said.</p> 
<p>Smith’s endorsement comes a day before the state’s Democratic and Republican precinct caucuses, the first step in each party’s formal endorsement process.</p> 
<p>In selecting Flanagan, Smith is elevating a fellow lieutenant governor and progressive over Craig, a moderate, for the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/tina-smith-wont-seek-reelection-senate-2026-00204058" target="_blank"><u>seat she has held since 2018</u></a>. Smith is the eighth sitting senator to endorse Flanagan, who also has the backing of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other members of the so-called Fight Club of progressive senators of which they are all a part. Former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who held the seat before Smith, also endorsed Flanagan.</p> 
<p>Craig has some high-profile endorsements of her own, with five senators including Sens. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) in her corner, as well as former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p> 
<p>Smith's decision comes against the backdrop of deadly incidents involving federal agents enforcing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the state that have opened new fissures in the Senate primary. While both candidates have called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s impeachment, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/18/minnesota-ice-midterm-campaigns-00735146" target="_blank"><u>Flanagan has attacked Craig for taking “pro-Trump” immigration votes last year, while Craig has countered that her rival is being “disingenuous”</u></a> about the content and context of the measures.</p> 
<p>Antoine Givens, a spokesperson for Craig’s campaign, said in a statement that Craig “is the only candidate who has proven she can both win tough, competitive races against a Republican and go toe-to-toe with the Trump administration.”</p> 
<p>“From voting to impeach Donald Trump twice and now taking on Kristi Noem and ICE, to writing the law that capped the cost of insulin at $35 for seniors and banning members of Congress from trading stocks, Angie Craig has shown she’s the fighter Minnesotans need to hold the powerful accountable,” Givens said.</p> 
<p>Nonpartisan public polling in the race has been scant. Polling conducted in the past month for Flanagan’s team, as well as a separate survey commissioned by a pro-Flanagan group, shows the lieutenant governor with a <a href="https://x.com/lisakashinsky/status/2014350124999184445?s=20" target="_blank"><u>double-digit lead over Craig</u></a>. A poll commissioned by Craig’s campaign <a href="https://x.com/lisakashinsky/status/2016923932566196478?s=20" target="_blank"><u>showed the race </u></a>within the margin of error.</p> 
<p>Craig has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/senate-fundraising-campaign-finance-fec-00759078" target="_blank"><u>built a fundraising advantage in the race</u></a>, raising $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 and starting the election year with $3.7 million in cash on hand. Flanagan, meanwhile, raised roughly $1 million in that timeframe and ended the year with $810,646 in the bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump on Sunday endorsed former Sen. John E. Sununu in New Hampshire’s open Senate race, boosting a longtime critic over one of his former ambassadors, Scott Brown.</p> 
<p>Trump hailed Sununu, who Republicans see as their best chance to flip the blue Senate seat, as an “America First Patriot” in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115996882630849069" target="_blank">Truth Social post Sunday afternoon</a>. And Trump said Sununu will “work tirelessly to advance our America First Agenda.”</p> 
<p>“John E. Sununu has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN — ELECT JOHN E. SUNUNU,” he posted.</p> 
<p>Sununu, a moderate who has opposed Trump across his presidential runs, thanked him in a statement and quickly pivoted to talking about his priorities for New Hampshire.</p> 
<p>“I want to thank the President for his support and thank the thousands of Granite Staters who are supporting me,” Sununu said. “This campaign has and always will be about standing up for New Hampshire — every single day.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s endorsement further tips the scales in an already pitched GOP primary between Sununu and Brown, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate before moving to New Hampshire and running unsuccessfully for Senate there in 2014. He served as Trump’s ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa in his first term, and has been presenting himself as the more Trump-aligned candidate as he courts the MAGA base.</p> 
<p>Brown vowed to fight on. And he took a veiled shot at Sununu, accusing him of not being sufficiently dedicated to the MAGA movement.</p> 
<p>“I am running to ensure our America First agenda is led by someone who views this mission not as a career path, but as a continuation of a lifelong commitment to service,” Brown said in a <a href="https://x.com/SenScottBrown/status/2018064672117678232?s=20" target="_blank">post on X</a>. “Let’s keep working.”</p> 
<p>The two are competing to take on Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Pappas issued a simple response to Trump’s endorsement of Sununu: “I’m Chris Pappas, and I approve this message,” he <a href="https://x.com/ChrisPappasNH/status/2018056253658849537?s=20" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. His campaign manager, Rachel Petri, said in a statement that Trump’s endorsement “confirms” that Sununu “will sell out Granite Staters to advance his political career.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s support for Sununu once would have seemed unfathomable. The scion of a moderate New Hampshire Republican dynasty, Sununu served as a national co-chair of former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s 2016 presidential campaign and joined his family in backing former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley for president against Trump in the 2024 GOP primary.</p> 
<p>Ahead of New Hampshire’s 2024 presidential primary, Sununu penned an op-ed lambasting Trump as a “loser.” (Trump went on to win by 11 points). And he later derided Trump’s 2020 election conspiracies as “completely inappropriate.”</p> 
<p>Republicans initially were bullish about flipping an open seat in purple New Hampshire that’s already changed hands between parties twice this century — Sununu defeated Shaheen to win the seat in 2002, then lost it to her in 2008 — and coalesced quickly behind the moderate Republican as their best option against Pappas. Sununu received instant backing from the GOP’s Senate campaign arm <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/john-sununu-new-hampshire-senate-00618083" target="_blank">upon his launch last October</a> and has wracked up <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/11/17/trumps-message-to-maga-00654111?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=b3fddf54-40a1-41f4-a5a6-b76118141c45" target="_blank">endorsements from the majority of Republican senators</a>. He’s also won support from Republican leaders in New Hampshire — all of which Trump noted in his Truth Social post Sunday.</p> 
<p>Trump also <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5235266-chris-sununu-potential-senate-bid/" target="_blank">initially supported Sununu's younger brother</a>, former Gov. Chris Sununu, running for the Senate seat. Chris Sununu, also a vocal Trump critic, declined to launch a bid, prompting GOP interest in his brother.</p> 
<p>But some in Trump’s Granite State MAGA base quickly rejected his endorsement of Sununu, calling it a “slap in the face to grassroots supporters” long loyal to the president.</p> 
<p>“The Sununu family openly mocked, degraded, and worked against the America First movement, the President himself, and the policies that energized New Hampshire voters,” a group of MAGA activists <a href="https://x.com/Nh4Trump603/status/2018048300658614638?s=20" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “We will continue and intensify our campaign opposition to the Sununu operation.”</p> 
<p>Sununu holds a wide lead over Brown in polling of the GOP primary. The latest, a University of New Hampshire online <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/survey_center_polls/922/" target="_blank">survey of likely primary voters from mid-January</a>, showed Sununu up 48 percent to 25 percent with 26 percent of likely voters undecided. But Pappas is ahead of both Republicans in hypothetical general-election matchups, leading Sununu by 5 percentage points and Brown by 10 percentage points in the UNH poll. The survey of 967 likely GOP primary voters had a margin of error of +/-3.2 percent.</p> 
<p>Pappas also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/senate-fundraising-campaign-finance-fec-00759078" target="_blank">outraised both Republicans</a>, bringing in $2.3 million last quarter and amassing a $3.2 million war chest heading into the year. Sununu hauled in $1.3 million and had $1.1 million in cash on hand in his primary campaign account while Brown raised $347,000 through his main account and had $907,000 in the bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One bright spot for Democrats as they face a tough path to taking back the Senate this year: Their candidates are raising a lot of money.</p> 
<p>Democrats outraised their GOP counterparts across several of this year’s marquee Senate races heading into 2026, according to new filings submitted to the Federal Election Commission on Saturday.</p> 
<p>Sen. Jon Ossoff, the only Democrat running for reelection in a state Donald Trump won, enters the year with a massive fundraising advantage over any of his GOP rivals in battleground Georgia. Democrats in North Carolina and Ohio also started the year with a major financial edge over their GOP rivals.</p> 
<p>But heated Democratic primaries have helped Republicans maintain a cash advantage in a few key states, including Michigan, Maine and Iowa.</p> 
<p>Strong fundraising will be critical to Democrats’ efforts to hold all their seats — including several that are open following battleground senators’ retirements — while also flipping four Republican ones.</p> 
<p>In a handful of primaries, including the Democratic contests in Michigan and Texas and the Republican lineup in Georgia, fourth-quarter fundraising numbers largely did not show any one candidate majorly distinguishing themselves from the rest.</p> 
<p>Here’s a rundown of what the fundraising looked like in key Senate races.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Georgia</h4> 
<p>Ossoff holds a significant fundraising advantage over his Republican opponents duking it out in the primary. He raised $9.9 million in the final quarter of 2025 and ended the year with $25.5 million in his war chest — numbers that are substantially higher than all of his GOP rivals combined.</p> 
<p>Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter brought in the most in the GOP primary, raising $1.7 million and entering 2026 with $4.1 million cash on hand. Ex-football coach Derek Dooley reported raising $1.1 million, while Rep. Mike Collins raised just shy of $825,000. Dooley ended the quarter with $2.1 million left in the bank, while Collins reported having $2.3 million.</p> 
<p>While Ossoff holds a massive fundraising advantage, the gap is likely to shrink when the Republican nominee is selected in May and the party, including its donors, coalesces around one candidate.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">North Carolina</h4> 
<p>Democratic former governor Roy Cooper maintains a fundraising advantage in North Carolina over former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley.</p> 
<p>Cooper <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/29/roy-cooper-raises-3-4-million-in-first-24-hours-of-his-senate-candidacy-00481528" target="_blank">broke fundraising records</a> when he launched his campaign and has continued to bring in large sums, raising $7 million from October through December last year, according to his filings with the FEC — nearly double the $3.8 million Whatley raised during the same period. Cooper entered 2026 with $12.3 million in his campaign coffers, a sizable haul that will be necessary as he prepares for November.</p> 
<p>Whatley, who has been endorsed by Trump, ended the fourth quarter with $3.7 million in cash on hand. Both candidates — the likely nominees in the state’s Senate race — bring extensive donor networks from their prior roles, setting up North Carolina to be one of the most expensive contests this cycle.</p> 
<p>Operatives in both parties say spending could reach $650 million to $800 million. Democrats are eying the North Carolina seat, left open by the retirement of GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, as one of their best pick up opportunities in November.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Michigan</h4> 
<p>In Michigan, where Democrats are looking to hold retiring Sen. Gary Peters’ seat, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/michigan-senate-mcmorrow-stevens-el-sayed-00758408" target="_blank">three Democratic front-runners are locked in a tight race</a> — and their fundraising reflects it.</p> 
<p>Rep. Haley Stevens holds an early fundraising advantage, raising $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2025 and entered the year with roughly $3 million in the bank. Widely seen as the establishment candidate in the contentious primary, Stevens benefits from being able to tap into her existing donor networks, but her opponents are not far behind. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow and physician Abdul El-Sayed each raised roughly $1.7 million and ended the year with around $1.9 million in the bank.</p> 
<p>With Michigan’s Aug. 4 primary — later than most states — the Democratic candidates will need to sustain strong fundraising numbers through what is shaping up to be a long and expensive intraparty fight.</p> 
<p>Former Rep. Mike Rogers, the frontrunner on the GOP side, raised $1.9 million and ended the fourth quarter with $3.5 million in cash on hand.</p> 
<p>Rogers — the candidate most national Republicans have coalesced around — will benefit from being the main GOP candidate while Democrats get through <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/michigan-senate-mcmorrow-stevens-el-sayed-00758408" target="_blank">their bruising primary</a>. He also ran for the Senate in 2024, giving him a network of donors to tap into. The GOP is eying Michigan — where <a href="https://www.politico.com/2024-election/results/michigan/" target="_blank">Trump won by just</a> over a point in 2024 — as a top pickup opportunity in November.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Maine</h4> 
<p>Political newcomer and oysterman Graham Platner outraised both Gov. Janet Mills, his main Democratic rival, and incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, who is one of the party’s top targets as the only GOP senator representing a state won by Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.</p> 
<p>Platner raised $4.6 million in the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 million for Collins and $2.7 million for Mills, who launched her campaign in mid-October.</p> 
<p>But Collins, who has not formally launched her campaign yet, sits on far more cash than both her Democratic rivals, with a little over $8 million in the bank compared to $3.7 million for Platner and $1.3 million for Mills.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Ohio</h4> 
<p>Former Sen. Sherrod Brown significantly outraised Sen. Jon Husted (R-Ohio) in the fourth quarter, giving Democrats a boost in their longshot bid to flip the Senate seat in the state that has turned increasingly red. Brown raised $7.3 million, while Husted — appointed last year to fill the seat vacated by JD Vance becoming vice president — raised $1.5 million.</p> 
<p>Brown, a prolific fundraiser, began 2026 with $9.9 million in his war chest. He is expected to need deep reserves again, after cryptocurrency-linked groups spent heavily against him during his unsuccessful 2024 reelection bid. Husted started the year with just under $6 million.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">New Hampshire</h4> 
<p>In New Hampshire, Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas continued to comfortably outraise his Republican competition in the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Pappas brought in $2.3 million in the fourth quarter and ended 2025 with $3.2 million cash on hand.</p> 
<p>Former Sen. John Sununu, who was defeated by Shaheen in 2008 and is running with the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, raised $1.3 million and had $1.1 million cash on hand. His Republican primary rival Scott Brown, who briefly represented neighboring Massachusetts in the Senate, raised just $374,000 and had $907,000 in the bank.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Texas</h4> 
<p>Money is flowing into the Democratic primary in Texas, where Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico both raised over $6 million during the fourth quarter.</p> 
<p>Crockett, who launched her Senate campaign in early December, raised $2 million from donors through the end of the month and transferred another $4.5 million from her previous House campaign account. But Talarico, a state representative from Austin, outraised Crockett with a $6.9 million quarter and ended the year with more money in the bank. He started 2026 with $7.1 million in his war chest, compared to $5.6 million for the Dallas-area representative.</p> 
<p>Both candidates outraised the Republican field by a wide margin. On the GOP side, state Attorney General Ken Paxton raked in $1.1 million, while incumbent Sen. John Cornyn raised $1 million for his campaign and another $6 million through two joint fundraising committees, which he has used to run TV ads on his behalf. Rep. Wesley Hunt, polling in third in the GOP primary, raised just over $429,000.</p> 
<p>Cornyn — whose reelection bid has been <a href="https://www.nrsc.org/press-releases/nrsc-chairman-tim-scotts-statement-on-texas-senate-race-2025-04-09/" target="_blank">endorsed by the NRSC</a> — still maintains a huge cash-on-hand advantage for the primary. He has more than $15 million in the bank between his campaign account and two joint fundraising committees, a war chest that could prove pivotal in the final stretch of the March 3 primary — or an extended runoff. He is locked in a neck-and-neck race with Paxton, according to public polls.</p> 
<p>Paxton entered 2026 with $3.7 million in the bank. Hunt had $778,660.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Iowa</h4> 
<p>Democrats duking it out in Iowa’s Senate primary posted modest fundraising hauls in the fourth quarter. State Rep. Josh Turek raised $677,000, while state Sen. Zach Wahls brought in $741,000. Nathan Sage, the third Democrat viewed as competitive for the nomination, brought in $229,000.</p> 
<p>Wahls entered 2026 with the cash-on-hand advantage. He had $733,000 left in his war chest, while Turek had just shy of $400,000. Sage had $86,000 in the bank at the start of the year.</p> 
<p>Whichever Democrats wins will need serious money to try flipping the seat left open by retiring Sen. Joni Ernst.</p> 
<p>Rep. Ashley Hinson brought in $1.6 million and had nearly $5.2 million in the bank at the end of 2025, a substantial fundraising advantage over all of her potential Democratic opponents.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Minnesota</h4> 
<p>In Minnesota, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are front-runners on the Democratic side vying for the open Senate seat. Craig has built a fundraising advantage, raising $2 million in the fourth quarter and ending it with $3.7 million left in the bank, while Flanagan raised roughly $1 million and ended the year with $810,646 in the bank.</p> 
<p>On the Republican side, Michele Tafoya, a former sideline reporter for “Sunday Night Football” and conservative commentator, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/michele-tafoya-minnesota-senate-00738041" target="_blank"><u>launched her bid in late January</u></a>, so her campaign launch fundraising isn’t yet public.Tafoya quickly received the backing of the Republicans' Senate campaign arm after launching her bid, so she is expected to have strong fundraising support to carry her through the August primary and into the general.</p> 
<p>The GOP contest has a handful of other primary contenders, including former Minnesota Republican Party Chair David Hann.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Alaska</h4> 
<p>Former Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola launched her Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/peltola-alaska-senate-2026-midterms-00721596" target="_blank"><u>bid in mid-January</u></a>, so her fourth quarter FEC report did not capture her Senate fundraising. But she raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/14/mary-peltola-alaska-fundraising-00726856" target="_blank"><u>POLITICO previously reported</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Sullivan raised $1.4 million during the fourth quarter, according to his FEC report, and entered 2026 with $5.8 million in his war chest.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DETROIT — As a professional driver navigated a gleaming new Ford Bronco Sport up a steep ridge, Mallory McMorrow found herself pinned in the back seat clinging to the overhead roll bar.</p> 
<p>The Detroit Auto Show course is designed to show off the Bronco’s capabilities — while putting an escapist scare into its thrill-seeking passengers. But it just reminded McMorrow of her day-to-day reality running for Michigan’s open Senate seat.</p> 
<p>“It’s a teeter-totter, man,” McMorrow told POLITICO about her race, after having navigated a very literal giant teeter-totter in the Bronco. “It could go any direction.”</p> 
<p>McMorrow is locked in a tight three-way primary with Rep. Haley Stevens and physician Abdul El-Sayed that has emerged as a test for what the next generation of Democrats will look like — and whether they can win a key swing-state election that will help determine Senate control.</p> 
<p>In recent days, the trio of candidates’ squabbles careened hour to hour from whether they should embrace Medicare for All, to how far Democrats should go in fighting ICE. In fact, the contest has emerged as a catch-all for every question and problem plaguing Democrats politically and tactically: Where should they stand on Israel and Gaza? Should they send their aging congressional leaders packing? What does electability look like in this political environment? Should Democrats tap into the attention economy or focus on traditional campaigning?</p> 
<p>El-Sayed, on the left, has taken consistently maximalist positions fitting for a man who wrote a book titled “Medicare For All: A Citizen’s Guide” and has vocal support from Sen. Bernie Sanders. Stevens, a classic swing-state centrist favored by many establishment Democrats, has taken smaller-bore stances. Between them sits McMorrow, who’s aiming to appeal to voters in both of their lanes.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/5d/32/3fbb1ef0403f9dd7966afb101a27/detroit-auto-show-49568.jpg" alt="Mallory McMorrow listens to a speaker talk about Toyota vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 14." data-portal-copyright="AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="26014822249568" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Mallory McMorrow listens to a speaker talk about Toyota vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 14."/><p>But this three-way battle to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) isn’t just about what direction the Democratic Party takes in Washington — it’s whether they can get there in the first place.</p> 
<p>Democrats think they see a route back to the Senate majority. But if they don’t hold on to their seat in Michigan, that faint path won’t materialize.</p> 
<p>“It's already a long shot, but it's a doable thing — but not without Michigan,” said David Axelrod, the longtime senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.</p> 
<p>Axelrod called it the “most fascinating and consequential primary” in the country.</p> 
<p>Democratic leaders both in Michigan and D.C. are growing more worried by the day that the hard-fought contest, which won’t be decided until the August primary, will exacerbate ideological tensions and leave the nominee in a weakened position heading into a contest against former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.).</p> 
<p>“We're used to having long primaries,” Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) told POLITICO. “No one loves them, but we're used to having them. And I don't think it's insurmountable.”</p> 
<p>For now, the race is wide open.</p> 
<p>Most <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5709140-democratic-senate-race-michigan/" target="_blank">public polls have found</a> a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/14/michigan-senate-race-poll-mike-rogers-haley-stevens-mallory-mcmorrow-abdul-el-sayed/88148893007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z11xx50p119950c119950d00----v11xx50d--65--&amp;gca-ft=169&amp;gca-ds=sophi" target="_blank">tight three-way race</a> in the primary, with Stevens or McMorrow holding a slight lead depending on the survey; in those same polls, Stevens runs slightly ahead of Rogers in the general election, with McMorrow just a bit behind her and El-Sayed a bit further back.</p> 
<p>Stevens has a fundraising edge. According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports, which posted on Saturday, she brought in $2.1 million in the past quarter and has $3 million cash on hand; McMorrow and El-Sayed both raised around $1.75 million and each has just under $2 million in the bank. Rogers raised just under $2 million and has just under $3.5 million cash on hand.<br></p><p>Part of the lack of separation in the polls is that voters haven’t engaged yet. The campaigns don’t expect cleavage until paid media starts happening in full (El-Sayed is the only candidate so far to roll out a statewide ad.)</p> 
<p>“Only the most political have started to click in,” Slotkin said.</p> 
<p>Michigan Democrats also worried about the impact the primary could have on the rest of the party as they fight to hold on to term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office and win back control of the Legislature.</p> 
<p>Whitmer, with her 60 percent approval rating, is facing a pressure campaign from some in the party to endorse either Stevens or McMorrow early in the race to narrow the field, according to two senior Michigan Democratic officials granted anonymity to speak about private discussions. Otherwise, one of them worried, “we could see real losses.”</p> 
<p>Whitmer and El-Sayed duked it out in a 2018 gubernatorial primary, and the officials say bad blood remains between them.</p> 
<p>A Whitmer spokesperson declined to comment.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/2a/84/60dcb5b2431cb454798f01730d41/democratic-national-convention-58746.jpg" alt="Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer is facing a pressure campaign from some in the party to endorse either Haley Stevens or Mallory McMorrow early in the race to narrow the field."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large">A clash of ideologies</h4> 
<p>The candidates have sharp ideological divides on major issues including health care, Israel and Gaza and accepting corporate PAC money.</p> 
<p>After a second person was killed by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, the three candidates' diverging approach to ICE and its funding supercharged the primary.</p> 
<p>While McMorrow and Stevens glad-handed at the Detroit Auto Show and union halls around the MLK holiday, after immigration agents killed Renee Good and before they killed Alex Pretti, El-Sayed, who has championed the Abolish ICE movement since 2018, went to Minneapolis and filmed <a href="https://x.com/AbdulElSayed/status/2013413511624315184?s=20" target="_blank">man-on-the-street</a> interviews for social media that were reminiscent of New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s successful viral campaign videos.</p> 
<p>He told POLITICO he was there to “understand what it looks like when an arm of the government lays siege to a city in America.” (El-Sayed also jetted to California for a fundraiser earlier that week).</p> 
<p>McMorrow has <a href="https://x.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/2015856774931169545?s=20" target="_blank">expressed support</a>for reforms to ICE, such as requiring agents to be unmasked, and argues Republicans and Democrats should “deny DHS one penny more until complete overhaul and accountability of this agency” happens.</p> 
<p>Stevens, meanwhile, is co-sponsoring a bill that would divert what she called ICE’s $75 billion "slush fund" to state and local law enforcement agencies; she has also called for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s impeachment.</p> 
<p>The candidates are also at odds over health care, an issue over which they’ve sparred in recent days.</p> 
<p>In an interview with Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen last week, El-Sayed reignited the health care debate. He said, “if you like your insurance from your employer or from your union, that can still be there for you,” apparently flipping on his stance on Medicare for All. McMorrow and her allies seized on his remarks as El-Sayed seemingly embracing a position he had repeatedly attacked her on. El-Sayed hosted a December <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE43EDDNHw0" target="_blank">health care town hall with Sanders</a> where he contrasted his Medicare for All support with McMorrow’s and Steven’s backing of a public option.</p> 
<p>“It’s wild to call yourself the ‘next generation’ of Democratic leadership and be running AGAINST Medicare for All in 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/AbdulElSayed/status/2005687425260302589?s=20" target="_blank">he posted on X</a> a month ago, quote-tweeting McMorrow.<br></p><p>In an interview with POLITICO after the dustup, El-Sayed declined to discuss specifics of his position on the record. In a statement, a spokesperson said that he supports Medicare for All as a baseline option for everyone, "and if folks want additional private coverage through a union or an employer then that can be there for them too."</p> 
<p>The conflict in Gaza has also led to sharp divisions in the race.</p> 
<p>El-Sayed, who is the son of Egyptian immigrants, has been an outspoken critic of Israel, which he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan-democratic-primary-gaza-genocide-00594679" target="_blank">has long said</a> was committing genocide in Gaza. That’s a major issue in a state with the highest percent of Arab-Americans in the country; more than 100,000 people voted “uncommitted” instead of backing then-President Joe Biden in the 2024 primary over his administration’s support of Israel — an effort El-Sayed helped lead.</p> 
<p>He told POLITICO that when he talks about U.S. tax dollars “being misappropriated to weaponize food against children and to subsidize a genocide, rather than to invest in real people in their communities and their kids and their schools and their health care, it is the single biggest applause line in every speech.”</p> 
<p>McMorrow took a bit more time to come to that view. In October, when asked whether she thought the conflict was a genocide, she paused for several seconds, exhaled, and responded, “Based on the definition, yes.” Her campaign said her view was informed by a September <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds" target="_blank">United Nations Commission of Inquiry report</a>.</p> 
<p>Stevens has been more supportive of Israel, and has the support of AIPAC, the politically influential pro-Israel lobby. Some senior Michigan Democrats have expressed concern that an AIPAC independent expenditure campaign backing Haley could make the primary even more toxic ahead of the general election. Asked about their plans, an AIPAC spokesperson told POLITICO they had no updates.</p> 
<p>Asked by POLITICO in November whether she was comfortable with AIPAC support, Stevens dodged, saying she’s delighted to “see the hostages get home,” and added she “wanted to see an enduring ceasefire where Hamas surrenders and so that we can get the people of Palestine and Israel in long standing peace, living peacefully, side by side with one another.”</p> 
<p>Stevens' campaign also attacked both El-Sayed and McMorrow's record on manufacturing, a sector that employs some 600,000 in Michigan. She told POLITICO that McMorrow "has a history of criticizing Michigan's key industries" and that El-Sayed "supports policies that would decimate Michigan's manufacturing economy," citing his support for the Green New Deal.</p> 
<p>“I’m going to call out what isn’t working for Michigan’s manufacturing economy, whether it is Mike Rogers or members of my own party,” Stevens said in an interview in the conference room of the Teamsters Local 234 union hall in Plymouth.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/3b/e9/f1daf64949928b1776673a1caba2/u-s-congress-37720.jpg" alt=" Some senior Michigan Democrats have expressed concern that an AIPAC independent expenditure campaign backing Rep.

Haley Haley could make the senatorial primary even more toxic ahead of the general election."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Old school vs. new school</h4> 
<p>The race is also shaping up as a test of offline coalitional politics at a moment increasingly defined more by viral videos than baby-kissing and union hall campaign stops.</p> 
<p>Stevens has leaned hardest into traditional brick-and-mortar campaigning, while El-Sayed has been much more focused online, with McMorrow’s approach once again falling between them.</p> 
<p>McMorrow’s biggest splash of the campaign so far came with a <a href="https://x.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/1964673063175307685?s=20" target="_blank">viral video</a> that attacked NFL RedZone for adding ads as “the latest example of corporate greed,” and tied it to spiking grocery costs. It earned nearly 2 million views.</p> 
<p>El-Sayed has built a national profile and fundraising network in part with a health care-focused podcast on Crooked Media, the network run by the Pod Save America team made up largely of former Obama senior advisers. At least three members, Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Ben Rhodes, appeared as hosts on an invite to El-Sayed’s fundraiser earlier this month in California.<br></p><p>Stevens has taken a different tack, putting more focus on campaign stops and meat-and-potatoes fights for local industry, especially auto and other factory jobs.</p> 
<p>In a year-out-from-election day memo, Stevens’ campaign argued that her “strength with Black Michiganders and union workers, her relentless focus on lowering costs and protecting Michigan manufacturing, and her record fighting for Michiganders — which has led to her winning tough primaries and general elections — will propel her to victory.”</p> 
<p>Campaigning at a Teamsters Local 234 union hall in Plymouth, she spent a lot more time talking about a local labor contract dispute than national concerns.</p> 
<p>“Look, manufacturing might not light up the internet, but it fuels a lot of jobs here,” she told POLITICO afterward.</p> 
<p>That dogged approach helped her flip and <a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2020-11-05/stevens-wins-second-term-in-us-house-11th-district" target="_blank">hold a swing seat</a>, then <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/rep-haley-stevens-beats-levin-in-battle-of-democratic-incumbents-00049449" target="_blank">win a tough incumbent-on-incumbent primary</a> in 2022, and is one she thinks will pay dividends now.</p> 
<p>“I’ve had a couple of tough primaries before, and I’m just out here trying to win it for Michiganders,” she said.</p> 
<p>But it remains unclear how well it will translate in a statewide campaign.</p> 
<p>“Haley seems to have more institutional support — whether or not it’s admitted as such — and that is a strength, but it also could be a weakness,” said a longtime Michigan Democratic operative who remains neutral in the race and was granted anonymity to assess the primary. “Her presence on the campaign trail I’m not sure is one that’s really like, <i>Man, I got to be with her.”</i></p> 
<p>Stevens has earned criticism over whether she can galvanize the online, grassroots activists, or electrify crowds on the trail. “She's [an] uneven campaigner when it comes to the retail stuff,” said Adam Jentleson, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist who<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/us/politics/democrats-liberals-jentleson-searchlight.html" target="_blank">is pushing for the party to break more with left-wing interest groups</a> and focus more on expanding the party’s coalition to win (he also voiced concern about El-Sayed as a general-election candidate).</p> 
<p>Right now, both El-Sayed and Stevens have been training most of their fire on McMorrow rather than each other, seeing her as the bigger threat to their potential voting coalitions.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/c5/8a/6b1ce2b846acbe373c2d5ba562ff/michigan-governor-2018-30366.jpg" alt="Abdul El-Sayed, left, is running with the support of progressives such as Sen.

Bernie Sanders, who also supported him in his 2018 run for governor."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Insiders and outsiders</h4> 
<p>Stevens’ electoral track record is part of why many establishment-leaning Democrats in D.C. prefer her in the race.</p> 
<p>Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) invited her to attend a fundraising retreat in Napa Valley that featured a crypto roundtable, but Stevens told POLITICO she did not attend due to the government shutdown.</p> 
<p>In an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/14/schumer-thinks-these-four-states-will-deliver-for-dems-in-november-00727181" target="_blank">interview with POLITICO</a>, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was bullish on defending Michigan but declined to appraise any individual candidacies; a DSCC spokesperson declined to comment on whether the committee would officially endorse in the race.<br></p><p>McMorrow has taken a very different approach to D.C.’s Democratic leadership.</p> 
<p>She<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/25/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan-senate-chuck-schumer-00246369?utm_campaign=5/16/25++AM:&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=Punchbowl+AM+and+Active+Subscribers+from+Memberful+Combined" target="_blank">told POLITICO last March</a>, before she was even officially a candidate, that she wouldn’t vote for Schumer as party leader should she win her Senate seat. She also previously penned a scathing letter to Biden following his disastrous debate with Donald Trump, urging him to drop out.</p> 
<p>“We’re drawing a contrast that is really about defining my lane,” McMorrow said in an interview at a campaign stop at a park in Grand Rapids late last year, suggesting Stevens, without naming her, was running “an uninspiring campaign that’s right out of the D.C. playbook” and that El-Sayed, also without naming him, was campaigning on the idea “that there’s just one weird trick to fix democracy.”</p> 
<p>Stevens has said it’s too early to determine whether to would back Schumer; she has called him “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/video/sotu-panel-breaks-down-democrat-infighting-after-shutdown-battle" target="_blank">a great leader.”</a></p> 
<p>El-Sayed also hasn’t said whether he’d back Schumer for leader. But he’s made it clear he is running headlong against the Democratic establishment.</p> 
<p>“The movement we’re building is about taking a bet on the divide in our politics not really being about left versus right, but being about the folks who are locked out and the folks who are locking them out,” El-Sayed told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>About the only thing the candidates can all agree on is the stakes of the contest.</p> 
<p>“The future of this party is going to be based on what happens in this race,” McMorrow said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump’s political war chest grew dramatically in the second half of 2025, according to new campaign finance disclosures submitted late Saturday, giving him an unprecedented amount of money for a term-limited president to influence the midterms and beyond.</p> 
<p>Trump raised $26 million through his joint fundraising committee in the back half of last year, and another $8 million directly into his leadership PAC. And a super PAC linked to him has more than $300 million in the bank.</p> 
<p>All together, a web of campaign accounts, some of which he controls directly and others under the care of close allies, within the president’s orbit have $375 million in their coffers.</p> 
<p>The funds far outstrip those of any other political figure — Republican or Democrat — entering 2026, and have no real historical precedent. And Trump could put them to use this year for the midterms, or to shape future elections, even as he cannot run for president again.</p> 
<p>Trump continues to outpace any other Republican in raising money, both from large and small-dollar donors. His joint fundraising committee — Trump National Committee, which pools fundraising for a variety of Trump-aligned groups — accounted for 1 in 8 dollars raised on WinRed, the primary Republican online fundraising platform, during the second half of 2025, according to a POLITICO analysis.</p> 
<p>And no super PAC raised even half as much in 2025 as the $289 million from MAGA Inc., the Trump-aligned super PAC that both the president and Vice President J.D. Vance appeared at fundraisers for last year.</p> 
<p>Trump has given few clues as to how he might put the funds to use. Trump National Committee primarily sends funds to the president’s leadership PAC, Never Surrender, with a bit of money also going to the Republican National Committee and Vance’s leadership PAC, Working For Ohio.</p> 
<p>Candidates cannot use leadership PAC money for their own election efforts. But the accounts — which are common across Washington and have long been derided by anti-money in politics groups as “slush funds” — allow politicians to dole out money to allies or fund political travel.</p> 
<p>Never Surrender spent $6.7 million from July through December, with more than half of that total going toward advertising, digital consulting and direct mail — expenses typically linked to fundraising.</p> 
<p>So far, Trump’s groups have held their powder in Republican primaries. While Trump has endorsed against a handful of Republican incumbents now locked in competitive primaries — including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — and threatened others, he hasn’t used money. A super PAC targeting Massie, MAGA KY, is run by Trump allies but has largely been funded by GOP megadonor Paul Singer.</p> 
<p>MAGA Inc.’s only election-related spending last year was to boost now-Rep. Matt Van Epps in the special election in Tennessee’s 7th District.</p> 
<p>Trump’s massive war chest makes him a political force, independent of the traditional party infrastructure. The RNC — which derives a significant portion of its fundraising from Trump — had $95 million in the bank at the end of the year, roughly a quarter of what the Trump-linked groups have.</p> 
<p>And their rivals at the Democratic National Committee are far worse off — at just over $14 million, while owing more than $17 million in debt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, a Democrat, won a special runoff election on Saturday to serve the remainder of former Texas Rep. Sylvester’s term, who died last year.</p> 
<p>The Associated Press projected that Menefee beat Amanda Edwards, an attorney and former member of the Houston City council, after a protracted process to fill the central Houston seat after Turner's death in March 2025. The process was drawn out by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott’s refusal to quickly schedule a special election following Turner’s death and a crowded field that triggered a runoff following the first round of voting in November.</p> 
<p>But the contest between the pair will continue: Both Menefee, 37, and Edwards, 44, are participating in the March primary for a newly refashioned 18th Congressional District, going up against Rep. Al Green, 78. That winner will be heavily favored to win a full two-year term in November.</p> 
<p>The March primary is the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/31/texas-18-runoff-dems-00758614" target="_blank"><u>latest example</u></a> of the generational change debate animating the Democratic Party, as the two young Democrats take on progressive icon Green, who has been in Congress for more than two decades. It's a fight that’s taking place nationwide, pitting young and old factions of the party against each other as they both argue they’re better fighters against Republicans.</p> 
<p>Residents in this district have been without consistent representation since former Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee died in 2024. Lee held the seat for three decades.</p> 
<p>Green’s current district was scrambled by the Texas GOP’s redistricting, prompting him to jump into the race to represent a new district that contains many of his constituents.</p> 
<p>Menefee’s victory is a huge boost to his public profile ahead of the primary. Early voting begins in two weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech mogul Elon Musk poured $10 million into two major Republican super PACs at the end of last year, according to campaign finance disclosures submitted Saturday, as he once again <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/elon-musk-gop-comeback-00751572" target="_blank">takes a more active role</a> in GOP politics.</p> 
<p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who had a public falling out with President Donald Trump last spring and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/20/elon-musk-political-spending-00358398" target="_blank">said he was giving up on political spending</a>, gave $5 million in December to each of the Congressional Leadership Fund and Senate Leadership Fund, two groups that aim to help the GOP keep control of Congress this year.</p> 
<p>It was Musk’s second round of donations to both groups this cycle, having <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/31/elon-musk-donations-clf-slf-00487699" target="_blank">previously given in June</a>, amid his feud with Trump. Those contributions came shortly before Musk floated starting his own political party, an initiative that never seemed to gain much headway.</p> 
<p>But Musk and Trump have patched up their differences more recently, with the tech CEO joining Trump for dinner at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month. Musk has also been back to advocating for Republican politics on X, which he owns, pushing for senators to pass a plussed up version of the SAVE Act, a bill that would require states to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2025/04/14/the-house-passed-the-save-act-what-comes-next-00288458" target="_blank">collect proof of citizenship</a> from people registering to vote.</p> 
<p>Musk has thrown his support behind a version called the SAVE Act Plus, calling for ID requirements and a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2013271550636826797?s=20" target="_blank">ban of mail voting</a> for most Americans along with other changes to election administration.</p> 
<p>Musk was the biggest individual donor to political committees during the 2024 election cycle, spending roughly $290 million, mostly through his own super PAC, America PAC, in support of Trump.</p> 
<p>In the first few months of the Trump administration, he played an active role with the Department of Government Efficiency, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/03/elon-musk-trump-bill-00382653" target="_blank">began fighting with Trump</a> and Republicans around the president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Musk also threw himself into a Wisconsin Supreme Court election in April where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/elon-musk-wisconsin-loss-reaction-00006129" target="_blank">his preferred candidate lost by 10 points</a>.</p> 
<p>Musk’s funds accounted for just a fraction of total fundraising for both SLF and CLF. SLF raised nearly $77 million in the final six months of 2025 and had $100 million cash on hand, while CLF raised over $38 million over that period and had more than $54 million cash on hand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic state election officials say the Justice Department’s letter to Minnesota over its voter rolls represents a significant escalation, with several warning that the Trump administration could use immigration enforcement to exert influence over November’s midterm elections.</p> 
<p>The officials are baffled by the Trump administration’s continued demand for access to state voter information and refuse to comply, telling POLITICO they view the requests as part of a broader effort by the administration to insert itself into state election proceedings.</p> 
<p>Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, has been at the center of the push after Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26508586-bondiwalzltr012426/?q=voter&amp;mode=document#document/p3" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Gov. Tim Walz that one condition of restoring “law and order” in the state amid the administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown would be for Minnesota to turn over its voter rolls to the federal government.</p> 
<p>Minnesota — one of two dozen states, along with the District of Columbia, sued by the administration — has rejected the request, prompting an unprecedented legal clash between the Justice Department and state election officials.</p> 
<p>“To me, [it] seems to be a project in service of the president's longstanding but false view that election systems around the country are rigging elections,” Simon told POLITICO. “And this project seems to be in service of that, and that's the best I can tell.”</p> 
<p>Simon said he has not heard back from the Trump administration since responding to the Bondi letter. “This was already a dispute, but it was a dispute being fought where it belongs, which is in a court of law,” he said.</p> 
<p>Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat running for reelection this year, called the letter to officials in Minnesota “extortion” and echoed the suggestion that the effort was aimed at something beyond voter rolls.</p> 
<p>"The voter roll stuff is not about voter rolls. There’s something bigger going on,” Fontes said in an interview this week, as dozens of secretaries of state gathered in Washington for a meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State. “They’re bits and pieces, interchangeable in this jigsaw puzzle, and we're being told something that's not true,” he added.</p> 
<p>The highly unusual push for access to states’ voter rolls is part of a yearlong campaign by the Trump administration, which says it is seeking to ensure that states’ voter registration practices comply with federal law and safeguard election integrity. The White House has requested voter records from nearly every state and Washington, D.C. The move comes as Trump frequently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/trump-2020-election-prosecutions-00738778" target="_blank">repeats his false claim</a> that the 2020 presidential election was “rigged.”</p> 
<p>The White House said it was authorized to make the requests under longstanding laws such as the Civil Rights Act.</p> 
<p>“The Civil Rights Act, National Voting Rights Act, and Help America Vote Act all give the Department of Justice full authority to ensure states comply with federal election laws, which mandate accurate state voter rolls. President Trump is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.</p> 
<p>The Justice Department did not immediately respond to POLITICO’s request for comment.</p> 
<p>At least 11 states have complied with the administration’s request, according to the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/tracker-justice-department-requests-voter-information" target="_blank">Brennan Center</a>.</p> 
<p>Wyoming is one of the states that complied, and its secretary of state, Chuck Gray, a Republican, told reporters on Friday that it has been “very disturbing” to watch Democrats rebuff the administration’s request to engage in what he described as regular upkeep of voter rolls.</p> 
<p>“We've been engaging in routine voter list maintenance that people support in making sure the voter lists are clean,” he said.</p> 
<p>The Justice Department has sued the 24 states — most, but not all, of which are helmed by Democrats — that have refused to comply, with most citing concerns over exposing sensitive voter information.</p> 
<p>“I'm certainly concerned that people may fear that the Department of Justice having access to the voting rolls might make them a target in some way,” said Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows.</p> 
<p>“This Justice Department has weaponized its office to target people based on identity and based on political affiliation,” she said.</p> 
<p>Uzoma Nkwonta, a partner at Elias Law Group, which is representing voters and civic organizations in several states who are also trying to prevent the release of voter rolls, called the effort “another example of overreach by the Department of Justice and the federal government.” “The fact that DOJ officials have stated publicly that they expect to see hundreds of thousands individuals removed from the rolls once they have this data … should set off a red flag,” Nkwonta said, noting that maintaining voter registration lists is a responsibility for the states, not the federal government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BANGOR, Maine — The federal immigration crackdown in Maine may have ended, but the political fallout could continue to reverberate through the 2026 election.</p> 
<p>Democratic Gov. Janet Mills <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/janet-mills-tv-ad-ice-00756765" target="_blank">launched her first Senate campaign ad on Friday</a> — and it’s focused on attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Political newcomer Graham Platner, competing with Mills for the Democratic nomination, held an anti-ICE protest at Sen. Susan Collins’ offices in Maine on Thursday, calling for her to block funds for the agency.</p> 
<p>The message from both Democrats was clear: Immigration enforcement politics is not going away, and they think it could be a winning issue as they look to unseat the only Republican senator up for reelection this year in a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024.</p> 
<p>But Collins’ Thursday announcement that ICE was ending its immigration enforcement campaign in Maine — dubbed Operation Catch of the Day by the Department of Homeland Security — released some of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/susan-collins-dhs-ice-shutdown-00751545?utm_content=topic/politics&amp;utm_source=flipboard" target="_blank">pressure that had been building</a> in the state for more than a week, with local leaders expressing an initial sense of relief.</p> 
<p>That campaign had left the state’s immigrant communities hiding in fear and Democrats and activists raging at their treatment. The surge disrupted life for many in southern Maine, with decreased attendance in schools, legal immigrants afraid to go to work and observers trailing ICE agents in the state.</p> 
<p>Now, in the aftermath of an operation that led to more than 200 arrests and prompted widespread protests, lawmakers and community leaders are navigating the upheaval left behind. The political impact continues to ripple.</p> 
<p>Collins' announcement Thursday morning, which implied her conversations with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had helped sway the decision, is emblematic of how she wants voters to think of her: a powerful pragmatist who can get results, including by standing up to her own party. And it was a high-profile reminder of her longstanding case that her senior role in Washington helps her deliver for the Pine Street State.</p> 
<p>Still, Democrats and activists, buoyed by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/republicans-trump-immigration-midterms-00754270" target="_blank">rapidly shifting public opinion around immigration enforcement</a> after videos of violent arrests and two fatal shootings in Minneapolis, are redoubling efforts for broader restrictions on ICE and its funding — along with a reckoning on what happened in Maine. Reports of the end of the operation in Maine, they said, are not enough.</p> 
<p>“Senator Collins is going to try to use this moment to trick us. To say that she, somehow, used her power to impose upon ICE,” Platner said in protests at the senator’s Portland and Bangor offices on Thursday, held hours after the end of the surge was announced.</p> 
<p>He mocked what he called a “pinky promise” she received from Noem to cheers from dozens of supporters who had gathered in Bangor in single-digit temperatures. “We all know it’s nonsense. What she is actually doing is trying to justify to us why she is about to try to give them 9 billion more dollars in funding."</p> 
<p>Platner demanded that Collins, the Senate’s top appropriator, cut off funding for ICE entirely, saying the Trump administration could not be trusted to follow the law.</p> 
<p>Collins advocated for passing a DHS funding bill that Democrats blocked this week, citing its funding for body cameras for federal officers as well as de-escalation training. Negotiations are likely to continue in Washington after lawmakers agreed to pass just a two-week stopgap. Failure to pass DHS funding would not stop ICE, as the agency is well-funded from Trump’s major budget bill last summer, but Democrats are hoping to leverage anger at the agency to pressure the GOP for reforms. A Collins spokesperson declined to comment for this story.</p> 
<p>The Maine senator’s positioning still held her somewhat as an outlier. Maine Republicans largely expressed support for federal immigration operations in the state while accusing Mills and Democrats of ginning up conflict with law enforcement. Local Republicans were largely quiet about Collins’ news of the drawdown.</p> 
<p>Mills, in an interview earlier in the week, derided Collins’ calls for retraining ICE officers, telling POLITICO that the “horse was out of the barn already.” On Thursday, she characterized the drawdown of ICE operations as insufficient, calling for Noem’s removal at DHS as well as congressional action to halt ICE funding until measures are in place at the agency to prevent what she characterized as “abuses of power.”</p> 
<p>“Until there are substantive measures and changes in place, no state — including Maine — is protected from the weaponization of Federal law enforcement agencies against its own citizens by the Trump Administration,” she said in a statement on Thursday.</p> 
<p>Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, a Democrat, sent a letter to Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons on Friday demanding information about the immigrants arrested in the state and where they are now.</p> 
<p>Community leaders and lawmakers are also working to understand what the drawdown means in practice, what happened to those detained by ICE and how to begin restoring trust among immigrants who have barely left their homes in weeks.</p> 
<p>“It is welcome news. ICE operations in Maine have failed to improve public safety and have caused lasting damage to our communities,” said Carl Sheline, the mayor of Lewiston, which is home to a large Somali American population and was one of the Maine cities to see significant ICE activity. “We will continue working to ensure that those who were wrongfully detained by ICE are returned to us.”</p> 
<p>Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat from Biddeford, said among those detained by ICE was a man named Marcos, whom Fecteau had previously employed as a contractor working on his home. Fecteau said he talked on Thursday to the man’s wife, who said he was at an ICE facility in Arizona two days earlier, but the ICE database was no longer showing his whereabouts.</p> 
<p>“Over the last week and a half there have been people in Maine who have been arrested and detained unlawfully. We want answers for those people. Who they are, where they are, what was the reason for their detention. Those things need to be answered,” Fecteau said. “I hope that Senator Collins, who clearly has some influence here — she spoke with Kristi Noem yesterday — I hope that was part of the conversation as well.”</p> 
<p>In Augusta on Thursday, Maine lawmakers heard testimony over a bill that would require ICE to obtain judicial warrants to search private spaces of schools and health care facilities, among other locations.</p> 
<p>Mills on Thursday threw her weight behind the new bill, citing in part the destabilizing effects of the recent surge. It was a notable move for the former prosecutor, who faced heat from progressives and Platner for not taking a stronger stance last year when she allowed a bill limiting law enforcement cooperation with ICE to go into effect without her signature, rather than signing it outright.</p> 
<p>Activists and observers who had been trailing ICE in Maine noted some agents appeared to be off duty on Thursday, reflecting the drawdown.</p> 
<p>“It's good news. I hope it's true. I hope that we can all find peace and rest in the next coming days,” Eric Nathanson, an activist with Jewish Action Maine who was arrested alongside other faith leaders earlier in the week while protesting at Collins’ Portland office. “If the surge is on pause, we reiterate the goal of no additional funding even more strongly.”</p> 
<p>But the images and experiences from the past week were not easily forgotten.</p> 
<p>“Three people in the past week were abducted in front of my workplace. My coworkers had to watch an ICE agent beat and drag people out of cars,” Nathanson said. “We will stay strong and stay vigilant.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOUSTON — House Republicans’ slim majority will be even leaner after Saturday, when Democrats vote to fill the Texas seat left open when Rep. Sylvester Turner unexpectedly died last year.</p> 
<p>But the vote will just be the next step in choosing who ultimately represents Texas’ 18th Congressional District for a full two-year term — and sets up the next generational change debate that has roiled the party nationwide.</p> 
<p>Just five weeks after Saturday’s special election runoff, voters in this Democratic hub of Black political power will return to the polls for a March primary to pick someone to represent the district after the seat was redrawn as part of Texas’ redistricting.</p> 
<p>On Saturday, voters are choosing between Harris County attorney Christian Menefee, 37, or former Houston City Councilmember Amanda Edwards, 44, to fill the current seat. The pair emerged as the top two vote-getters in a crowded 16-person primary in November, with Menefee finishing ahead of Edwards by 3 percentage points.</p> 
<p>The winner will then hold the incumbency for just a few weeks before challenging activist icon Rep. Al Green, 78. That March election, all three candidates argue, is about choosing the best fighter to stand up to House Republicans, the Trump administration and the Texas GOP, which has been encroaching on Houston’s autonomy in recent years as Republicans try to weaken Democrats’ influence in the one of the nation’s largest cities.</p> 
<p>“It’s going to be a fight between generations,” said Marc Campos, a longtime Democratic consultant in Houston, who is unaffiliated with any campaign.</p> 
<p>Saturday’s oddly timed runoff is occurring after months of delays by Gov. Greg Abbott, who didn’t call for the special election to fill the seat until eight months after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/texas-democrat-sylvester-turner-dies-00213068" target="_blank">Turner's death</a>. Turner, in 2022, revealed he had been recovering from bone cancer and his family said he died from “enduring health complications.” He had been elected to replace former Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/20/texas-rep-sheila-jackson-lee-dies-at-age-74-00169909" target="_blank">died in office</a> in 2024 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She served the district for nearly three decades.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/9f/7f/011bbdc14490b3132df6ffc7fe1d/election-2025-congress-texas-71344.jpg" alt="Democratic 18th Congressional District candidate Christian Menefee greets voters near a polling place on Nov. 4, 2025, in Houston. " data-portal-copyright="Ashley Landis/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="25308654371344" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Democratic 18th Congressional District candidate Christian Menefee greets voters near a polling place on Nov. 4, 2025, in Houston. "/><p>Abbott justified the special election hold up by saying he didn’t trust Harris County to conduct a swift and valid election. The governor, who has set his sights on flipping the county in November, has <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-calls-for-investigation-of-harris-county-elections" target="_blank">claimed for years</a> that there are widespread problems with electoral administration in Houston.</p> 
<p>Texas Democrats said Abbott’s foot-dragging to fill the seat — which has advantaged House Republicans' paper-thin majority in Washington — is another example of GOP meddling with Democratic power in major cities. Republicans’ off-cycle redistricting last year scrambled Democratic seats in Houston, Dallas and Austin. Green, a towering figure in Houston political circles, jumped into the race for the newly gerrymandered 18th seat after the neighboring district he held for more than 20 years was carved up by the GOP.</p> 
<p>In another sign of how redistricting has muddled campaigns, Menefee and Edwards are running in Saturday’s runoff under different lines from the upcoming March primary — forcing the pair to run simultaneous campaigns with two overlapping but not identical sets of voters. Early voting in the March primary begins in two weeks.</p> 
<p>“This is a microcosm of forced redistricting,” said Odus Evbagharu, a Menefee aide. “It’s something that got forced down our throats, and now we just have to live with that.”</p> 
<p>During the final stretch of the runoff, candidates crisscrossed both the old and new 18th districts, an area of central Houston with a large Black population. About a quarter of the district’s current constituents live within its new iteration.</p> 
<p>At a candidate forum held in a Catholic church on Thursday evening, Green, Menefee, Edwards and a fourth candidate running in the primary with little name recognition, newcomer Gretchen Brown, quickly rattled off their biographies and what they would bring to Washington.</p> 
<p>For Green, it wasn’t an introduction as much as a reminder to the audience that he has represented many of them for two decades. A significant share of Green’s constituents in the new 18th district were shuffled over from Green's old district.</p> 
<p>“It is important for people to understand that I'm not moving into a new congressional district,” Green said while taking the microphone and brandishing his signature gold-capped cane. “I am not. The congressional district moved to me.”</p><img src="https://static.politico.com/ad/40/ec994b5049a8b0500a435bcdb265/supreme-court-voting-rights-73810.jpg" alt="Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) speaks to demonstrators in front of the Supreme Court as the court hearings oral arguments in the Louisiana second majority black Congressional district, in Washington, Oct. 15, 2025. " data-portal-copyright="Cliff Owen/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="25288543573810" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) speaks to demonstrators in front of the Supreme Court as the court hearings oral arguments in the Louisiana second majority black Congressional district, in Washington, Oct. 15, 2025. "/><p>In this era when Democrats are eager to forcefully counter Republicans, voters here have a choice: Support a trusted figure who can navigate Washington or take a chance on a younger representative seen as the future of the party. It's an urgent debate within the party as Democrats plot their strategy for regaining power, and is playing out in primaries across the country. Some other top Democrats facing generational primaries, including Reps. Nancy Pelosi of California and Steny Hoyer of Maryland, opted not to run again.</p> 
<p>“Al Green has a great name,” said Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis, who endorsed Menefee in the runoff but has not weighed in on the primary. “But then, on the other hand, whoever wins [the runoff] will get a bump of celebrity status.”</p> 
<p>Menefee made local history as the youngest elected Harris County attorney — the first Black person in the job — and has built his reputation on going head-to-head with Abbott, suing the governor’s ban on mask mandates and challenging his demands to audit local elections. It’s his first stint in public office after he ran a surprise campaign ousting the three-term incumbent in 2020.</p> 
<p>Menefee — who is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChristianDMenefee/videos/1554491595797005/" target="_blank">running ads</a> playing on 90’s millennial nostalgia — has racked up endorsements from organizations like Leaders We Deserve and Houston Black American Democrats, more than a dozen labor groups, and prominent figures like Rep. Jasmine Crockett and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke.</p> 
<p>Edwards draws on broad support from women and from her years as an attorney and at-large member of the city council. She won the endorsement of past opponent Jolanda Jones, a state representative who has served as a main Menefee antagonist, criticizing him for continuing to collect his government salary while campaigning.</p> 
<p>Edwards is also a familiar face on campaign mailers: She ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2020, Houston mayor in 2023 and U.S. House in 2024. Her career in politics began when she was a congressional aide for Lee as a recent college graduate.</p> 
<p>Menefee and Edwards dismiss the idea that the primary will be a referendum on age, seeing it instead as an expression of voters’ desire to see broad change in Congress.</p> 
<p>“What I think people want is something new,” Menefee said in an interview. “They want new strategic thinkers who are going to come in and have a plan for opposition against the president.”</p> 
<p>Edwards argues it's also an issue of continuity. A Green victory would mean that some constituents living in the district will have been represented by four lawmakers in three years. “They want to pass that torch forward and this is an opportunity to do that,” she said. “It's not a question of age. It's a question of succession.”</p> 
<p>Green, in an interview, said he expects people will vote for him if they primarily value experience and accomplishments, ticking off his leadership on the Homeland Security and Oversight committees, along with the billions he has steered toward his district and recommendation of three judges confirmed during the Obama administration.</p> 
<p>“I bring to the table traditionally what people have looked for when they were trying to make a decision,” he said. “So we'll find out whether tradition continues or whether we'll have a different circumstance.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immigration enforcement is sowing chaos in Minneapolis and across the country. Democrats, elections officials and civil rights groups fear it could interfere with this November’s elections — and are scrambling for a response.</p> 
<p>They’re warning that the White House’s deployments of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents could act as a voter suppression tool should armed officers conduct raids at or near polling locations, scaring citizens into staying home.</p> 
<p>“You have to see what's happening: Trump is trying to create a pretext to rig the election,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “It stands to reason that this private police [force] that he’s building is, in part, to be used to try to suppress turnout in the election.”</p> 
<p>Senate Democrats considered a requirement banning ICE agents from polling sites as part of their demands in negotiating the Homeland Security funding bill, according to Murphy and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.). But that policy was not included in <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/28/congress/democrats-dhs-minnesota-shutdown-00753256" target="_blank">Senate Democratic appropriators’ final list of demands</a> to avoid a partial government shutdown, leaving voting rights advocates and Democratic state election officials on edge about what’s to come.</p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called fears of voter suppression “Democrat conspiracies” with “no basis in reality.”</p> 
<p>“President Trump cares deeply about the integrity of our elections — and so do the millions of Americans who sent him back to office based on his pledge to secure our elections,” Jackson said in a statement. “These Democrat conspiracies have no basis in reality and their claims shouldn’t be amplified uncritically by the mainstream media. ICE is focused on removing criminal illegal aliens from [the] country, who should be nowhere near any polling places because it would be a crime for them to vote.”</p> 
<p>ICE's aggressive crackdowns have already led to citizens hiding at home, and election officials worry that fears of harassment and arrest could keep them from exercising their right to vote.</p> 
<p>“In Maine, we saw people were afraid to leave their homes for groceries, to go to work or to go to school, because of fear of wrongful arrest and imprisonment,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who’s running for governor, told POLITICO on Thursday. “If people are too afraid to go to the grocery store because armed ICE agents are patrolling the streets, that may increase fears about going to vote.”</p> 
<p>Bellows said her office is preparing for next month’s special legislative election by ensuring voters are comfortable with absentee voting procedures, especially those in areas with large immigrant populations that have been impacted by ICE’s recent crackdown in the state.</p> 
<p>Immigration enforcement activity near polling locations could dissuade those with noncitizen family members or voters of color, who fear being racially profiled, from turning out. And widespread deployments of immigration officers to battleground districts could cause chaos in key races and swing close elections.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration dispatched about 3,000 federal agents to Minneapolis to apprehend non-citizens in an operation that many in the state and elsewhere consider heavy-handed and excessive. The president and senior officials have indicated that the operation is about more than just law enforcement.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/13/trump-minnesota-reckoning-retribution-warning-00724534" target="_blank">called the Minnesota operation</a> a “day of reckoning and retribution” and has tied the operation to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/brace-for-impact-trump-turns-fraud-into-new-weapon-against-blue-states-00719401" target="_blank">welfare fraud</a> in the state. On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26508586-bondiwalzltr012426/" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz demanding he turn over the state’s voter rolls, an action <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/minnesota-operation-metro-surge-case-00746755" target="_blank">lawyers for the state of Minnesota described</a> as a “shakedown” and a “ransom note.”</p> 
<p>“The demand for the voter rolls tells you what this is really about,” Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), who oversaw California’s elections for six years as secretary of state, told reporters Wednesday. “It’s about trying to rig the next election, and a desperate attempt to hold onto power.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap29-sec592.htm" target="_blank">Federal law is explicit</a> in banning “any troops or armed men at any place where a general or special election is held,” unless to “repel armed enemies of the United States[.]” Many local election officials also take great care to avoid spooking voters by placing law enforcement at polling places, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/30/election-threats-violence-00186377" target="_blank">some states even have laws regulating this</a>. Voter intimidation is illegal across the entire country.</p> 
<p>But Trump has falsely and repeatedly claimed for more than a decade <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-migrants-border-voter-fraud-campaign-40bbf5748615a3b1f6087ff920f59278" target="_blank">that millions of illegal immigrants vote</a> in the U.S., arguing that was one factor in his 2020 loss. He also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/23/meadows-trump-police-polls-400255" target="_blank">pledged before the 2020 election to send “sheriffs” and “law enforcement”</a> to polling places.</p> 
<p>Some Trump allies have openly described the possibility of deploying immigration enforcement officers to polling sites to ensure non-citizens do not vote.</p> 
<p>“They’re petrified over at MSNBC and CNN that, hey, since we’re taking control of the cities, there’s going to be ICE officers near polling places,” former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said <a href="https://warroom.org/bannons-warroom-show-clip-roundup-19-august-25-am/" target="_blank">during his show last August</a>. “You’re damn right. … We’re not going to allow any illegal aliens to vote.”</p> 
<p>Civil rights groups are preparing for the possibility that Trump exercises emergency powers to allow such a move.</p> 
<p>Joanna Lydgate, CEO of the States United Democracy Center, told reporters this week that the Trump administration is “using these violent ICE operations as a weapon” for political ends.</p> 
<p>“[Trump] might try to use an executive order or his emergency powers in the 11th hour to interfere with the upcoming election, which is, of course, something that no president in American history has ever done, but something that we need to be prepared for,” Lydgate said Monday during a press briefing.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has continued its focus on election administration. On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249" target="_blank">the FBI executed a search warrant</a> at the Fulton County elections office outside Atlanta. Last week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/20/trump-musk-doge-social-security-00737245" target="_blank">the Justice Department revealed</a> that DOGE employees were secretly communicating with an advocacy group seeking to “overturn election results in certain states” and may have used Social Security data to match voter rolls. Last week in Davos, Trump suggested <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/trump-2020-election-prosecutions-00738778" target="_blank">prosecutions are forthcoming</a> related to the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>State election officials in both parties <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/tulsi-gabbard-2020-election-investigation-00755487" target="_blank">are anxious to see</a> why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi will address the winter meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State on Friday. A DHS spokesperson didn’t respond to request for comment for this story.</p> 
<p>Nonprofit legal groups are already gearing up to challenge any efforts to intimidate voters around the November midterms, said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward.</p> 
<p>“Litigation is going to remain an incredibly important guardrail,” said Perryman, whose nonprofit <a href="https://democracyforward.org/work/legal/stopping-doges-unlawful-seizure-of-americans-social-security-data/" target="_blank">led one of the lawsuits</a> against DOGE’s access to voter information. “And there are many cases that can be swiftly filed on an emergency basis, or even potentially proactively, in order to try to keep the communities as safe as possible.”</p> 
<p>David Becker, the executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, warned that election officials across the country — from secretaries of state to local officers — are seeing “a level of federal interference in their work which is unconstitutional and unprecedented.”</p> 
<p>“I want to stress how unusual this is,” Becker, a former DOJ civil rights attorney, told POLITICO. “County election officials shouldn't have to be thinking about what the president of the United States might say about elections.”</p> 
<p>Those elections officials are working to instill trust in the electoral process, Becker said, and will encourage voters to utilize a variety of alternative ways to cast a ballot, such as early voting or voting by mail, depending on the state.</p> 
<p>An attempt to heighten immigration enforcement before the election could just as easily backfire for Republicans. Trump is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/republicans-trump-immigration-midterms-00754270" target="_blank">now under water on the immigration issue</a>, with polls showing a majority of voters believe his deportation push went too far and want to see it reined in. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who worked in the Biden White House as an adviser on democracy and voting rights, pointed to high turnout in this week’s special elections for Minnesota legislature seats in Democratic-heavy districts, where Democrats romped.</p> 
<p>“In places where there might be disruption, Minnesota is proving that you might well earn yourself a real significant backlash,” Levitt said.</p> 
<p>But even talking about election suppression has a risk of discouraging voters, convincing them there is risk involved or that the elections might be rigged anyway. Conversely, talk of vote-rigging can do the same thing.</p> 
<p>“Our fight right now is both to protect the security of our elections and people's faith in them, because they're deeply intertwined and they're both under attack,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gov. Janet Mills’ first ad buy as she seeks to unseat Sen. Susan Collins features a repudiation of ICE as Democrats nationwide seize on backlash over the agency’s aggressive tactics.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oC0ffYabwc" target="_blank">new TV spot</a>, shared first with POLITICO, pairs news clippings and videos of ICE agents aggressively detaining people with footage of Mills criticizing the deportation campaign during <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/janet-mills-ice-raids-state-address-00751216" target="_blank">her State of the State address</a> on Tuesday.</p> 
<p>“Our federal government has deployed masked law enforcement onto the streets, including here in Maine, stoking fear in our communities and killing American citizens in Minnesota,” Mills says in the ad. “It’s ridiculous, outrageous and unconstitutional.”</p> 
<p>The six-figure buy goes up statewide on Friday and is running across broadcast and digital for the next two weeks.</p> 
<p>It comes as immigration enforcement has become a national political issue, with voter backlash against ICE raids leading Democrats to talk more about an issue <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/republicans-trump-immigration-midterms-00754270" target="_blank">that had once been favorable for Republicans</a>.</p> 
<p>An ICE surge in Maine, dubbed Operation Catch of the Day by Homeland Security officials, received widespread backlash from Democrats and local leaders, who highlighted cases of Maine residents being detained by the agency despite having legal work permits and no criminal histories. The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend further inflamed anger in Maine, too.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/ice-ends-maine-operation-00754382" target="_blank">Collins announced Thursday that ICE would be halting its surge</a> in the Pine Tree State, but the fallout of the heightened enforcement continues to roil the state. Mills’ decision to seize on ICE for her first ad is a sign she believes the issue will have staying power.</p> 
<p>Mills’ main primary opponent, oysterman and political newcomer Graham Platner, has also gone after Collins on ICE this week, holding protests outside her offices in Portland and Bangor on Thursday.</p> 
<p>Platner <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/graham-platner-janet-mills-maine-senate-tv-ad" target="_blank">ran TV ads skeptical of Mills</a> when the governor first jumped into the Senate race last fall. His campaign recently went up with more biographical spots and has pledged to stay on air through the June primary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota Democrats are figuring out the delicate art of Trump diplomacy this week.</p> 
<p>First, President Donald Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115962378381121858" target="_blank">had a “very good call”</a> with Gov. Tim Walz, an inflection point after days of heated GOP attacks on the former vice presidential candidate. Then, Trump declared he’d <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115963713974102712" target="_blank">had another “very good” conversation</a>, this time with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Both sides had been looking to deescalate, and Trump seemed to be turning a corner on the two Democratic <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115951636521315703" target="_blank">“sanctimonious political fools”</a> he had initially blamed after the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>Then the mayor accidentally broke the detente.</p> 
<p>After meeting with Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, <a href="https://x.com/MayorFrey/status/2016241048209518736" target="_blank">Frey reiterated on social media</a> that “Minneapolis does not and will not enforce federal immigration laws,” which a person close to Frey said was simply intended as “clarifying what our stance was.” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972940749866695" target="_blank">But Trump quickly shot back</a>, declaring Frey’s “statement is a very serious violation of the Law” and warning the mayor that “he is PLAYING WITH FIRE.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s response “surprised” the mayor, according to the person close to him, who was granted anonymity to speak about a sensitive issue. This person said city officials saw Trump’s response “as a threat.” Nonetheless, Frey, in recent appearances on CNN and at the National Mayor’s Conference in Washington on Thursday said “the Operation Metro Surge needs to end” while eschewing the kind of combative rhetoric that he had used over the weekend. Homan told reporters on Thursday morning that he’d asked for immigration agencies to work on a “drawdown plan.” After a tense day or two, the fragile peace appeared to be holding.</p> 
<p>The episode illustrates just how delicate the ongoing talks to deescalate the crisis in Minnesota are with a president known for his capricious and erratic negotiating style. As Democrats across the country see a rare political opening on immigration, Minnesota Democrats are first and foremost trying to end the immigration crackdown in their own state. Despite their public confidence, they’re privately on tenterhooks over whether Trump will take the exit ramp.</p> 
<p>“This back and forth [between Trump and Frey] is unhelpful,” said one Minnesota Democratic strategist, granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation. “Strategically, I wouldn’t have phrased it that way. It’s not a huge mistake, but it’s not helpful.”</p> 
<p>It’s a lesson foreign leaders are deeply familiar with already: Diplomatic breakthroughs with Trump can come fast, and fall apart just as quickly. European officials have regularly had to scramble to respond to the president’s controversial statements on the war in Ukraine or the ownership of Greenland with highly deferential overtures in both public and private. They’ve had mixed success.</p> 
<p>Throughout Trump’s second term, Democrats have struggled to find their footing in negotiations with the president. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer drew fury from his own party for voting for a GOP-drafted continuing resolution in March. In October, Democrats forced what would become the longest government shutdown in US history over health care funding, but they emerged from it without any tangible deliverables. But in Minnesota, Democrats appear to hold the political upper hand, as Trump’s polling numbers, particularly his handling of immigration, plummeted in recent weeks — and he signals eagerness to cut a face-saving deal.</p> 
<p>“Everyone needs to give something here to move on from this,” one Minnesota union chief said — adding that it can be difficult to do. A Democratic operative in the state expressed hope that Frey’s post was merely “a bump on the exit ramp.”</p> 
<p>But not all Minnesota Democrats agree that playing ball is the way forward. “Being nice isn’t somehow going to stop Donald Trump when anything can set him off,” said Ron Harris, a Democratic National Committee member from Minnesota. Frey’s post, he said, simply “emphasized what the law is.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Frey said in a statement that “the mayor has been communicating both publicly and privately, including to the president and Tom Homan, that Minneapolis would be happy to partner on criminal investigations, and that’s what we’re focusing our limited law enforcement resources on.”</p> 
<p>It’s unclear when the Trump administration will end its operation in Minnesota, though the president appears motivated to do so. The Trump administration has already pulled back in other states. Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins said that ICE has “<a href="https://x.com/SenatorCollins/status/2016830738595794944" target="_blank">ended its enhanced activities</a>” in Maine after politicians on both sides of the aisle urged the agency to stop.</p> 
<p>For Democrats studying Trump diplomacy, Walz and Frey may offer a template in some of their tonal differences. Interviews with nearly a dozen Minnesota Democrats said the pair were largely aligned in substance, and the rhetorical daylight, highlighted by the social media scuffle with Trump, reflects their differing constituencies and styles — and political realities.</p> 
<p>Last November, Frey held off a stiff challenge from the left from state Sen. Omar Fateh, a Democratic Socialist, to win reelection. But the progressive wing of the party <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-city-council-progressives-dsa-majority/601556625" target="_blank">retook the majority on city council, too</a>. “He’s facing a lot of internal pressure” from the city council to “continue calling out the craziness,” said a Democratic strategist who, like others, was granted anonymity to candidly discuss a sensitive issue.</p> 
<p>“Frey’s constituency is different” than Walz, the strategist said, “and in general, I think he’s been more combative … They’re also just different people with different negotiating styles.”</p> 
<p>The 44-year-old mayor is also seen as a potential statewide candidate, layering in its own political calculations. Minnesota Sen. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/amy-klobuchar-minnesota-governor-00754285" target="_blank">Amy Klobuchar’s gubernatorial run</a> — and departure from the Senate — could likely open up another statewide office after 2026.</p> 
<p>Walz, for his part, is unshackled from an immediate political future. The two-term governor <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/05/tim-walz-out-minnesota-00710541" target="_blank">dropped his reelection bid earlier this month</a>, after a welfare fraud scandal in the state threatened to engulf his campaign. Walz acknowledged the scandal affected his decision and Republicans were eager to tie him to it, but he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p> 
<p>Abou Amara, a Minneapolis civil rights attorney, said Frey’s aggressive rhetoric toward the beginning of the federal government’s intervention was "necessary," but now “everyone understands there has to be a ratcheting down.”</p> 
<p>“The mayor is obviously closer to the people, he understands the visceral pain and the trauma that the people are experiencing,” Amara said. “The governor is operating on a level of having a bit more authority here on how the state interacts with the federal government. … Governor Walz is in a position to deliver on things with the federal government in a way that the mayor is not.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats, election experts and even some members of the Trump administration expressed alarm and bewilderment about why Tulsi Gabbard was on the scene as the FBI raided a Georgia election office that has been at the center of Donald Trump’s debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen.</p> 
<p>Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, <a href="https://x.com/corinne_perkins/status/2016673423708053509" target="_blank">was photographed late Wednesday</a> outside the Fulton County elections office near Atlanta, Georgia, as the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249" target="_blank">FBI executed a search warrant</a> to seize ballots and other records related to the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>As DNI, Gabbard has no domestic law enforcement authority and is not typically involved in criminal investigations, a reality that alarmed many Democrats on Capitol Hill — and even puzzled some Trump officials. </p> 
<p>“My constituents in Georgia and I think much of the American public are quite reasonably alarmed in asking questions after the director of national intelligence was spotted bizarrely and personally lurking in an FBI evidence truck in Fulton County, Georgia, yesterday,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/34364" data-person-id="34364">Jon Ossoff</a> (D-Ga.) said during an unrelated Senate hearing Thursday morning.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/spy-chief-tulsi-gabbard-is-hunting-for-2020-election-fraud-07ea2383?mod=hp_lead_pos3" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday</a> that Gabbard was investigating the 2020 election, and has regularly briefed Trump and other administration officials about her search. “President Trump and his entire team are committed to ensuring a U.S. election can never, ever be rigged again. Director Gabbard is playing a key lead role in this important effort,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told The Journal.</p> 
<p>Olivia Coleman, a spokesperson for Gabbard, confirmed the DNI was on the scene in Atlanta. She did not immediately respond to follow-up inquiries about her reported probe of the 2020 vote.</p> 
<p>Despite concerns raised by Democrats, Gabbard appears to be taking on a more expansive public role in American elections. On Thursday, White House aide Jared Borg told a group of election officials that Gabbard — alongside Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi — is set to address the winter meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State on Friday.</p> 
<p>Trump has long fixated on unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in Georgia in the aftermath of the 2020 election, which he lost to former President Joe Biden. He has continued to falsely suggest that the election was stolen since returning to the White House, including in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. </p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Davis Ingle defended Gabbard in an emailed statement. “Director Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases and election infrastructure,” he wrote. “She has and will continue to take action on President Trump’s directive to secure our elections and work with our interagency partners to do so.”</p> 
<p>Trump spent much of the morning amplifying claims that the Georgia vote was rigged on Truth Social, and <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115978031218105674" target="_blank">even called attention to Gabbard’s role</a> in Wednesday’s raid. </p> 
<p>Gabbard’s role remains confusing to some in the administration. Two current Justice Department officials and one Trump administration official said they were also puzzled by Gabbard’s presence in Fulton County. “It remains a mystery to me why she would need to be there,” said the administration official, who, like others interviewed, was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. </p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66837" data-person-id="66837">Mark Warner</a>, (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, <a href="https://x.com/MarkWarner/status/2016722913420845333" target="_blank">argued on X Wednesday</a> that there “are only two explanations” for Gabbard’s presence in the raid.</p> 
<p>“Either Director Gabbard believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus — in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed’ of relevant national security concerns — or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for the office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” he wrote.</p> 
<p>Warner and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/himes-warner_letter_to_dni_1.29.2026_.pdf" target="_blank">wrote to Gabbard Thursday</a> to request briefings for both panels about the legal basis, scope, and justification of her participation in the raid.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189610" data-person-id="189610">Alex Padilla</a> (D-Calif.), who before entering Congress was California’s chief election official, told a panel at NASS on Thursday that Gabbard’s presence at the raid should be a reminder about “the urgency of the situation.”</p> 
<p>“I guess they’re still searching for 11,000 more votes,” he quipped, referencing a call Trump had with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after losing the 2020 election. “But it should be a reminder — or a wake up — that this can happen at any point once again between now and this coming November.”</p> 
<p>Gabbard’s appearance at the raid led some Democrats to believe she wanted to be there to claim credit for it publicly.</p> 
<p>“When the head of a department participates in something, it's about PR, not about process and the law,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51223" data-person-id="51223">Jack Reed</a> (D-R.I.) told POLITICO. “If they have evidence, they want evidence and they have a valid warrant, and you let the professionals go in and do that.”</p> 
<p>While Gabbard has veered in and out of the good graces of Trump during her tenure as DNI, she appeared to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/23/gabbard-once-scorned-takes-center-stage-with-latest-obama-allegations-00471183" target="_blank">hit a high point last summer</a> when she alleged that senior U.S. intelligence officials under then-President Barack Obama were guilty of treason because they had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/18/tulsi-gabbard-2016-election-investigation-00463779" target="_blank">fabricated intelligence about Russian meddling in the 2016 election</a>.</p> 
<p>Trump said last week that individuals who played a role in that year’s vote <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/trump-2020-election-prosecutions-00738778?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack" target="_blank">will soon be prosecuted</a>.</p> 
<p>David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told reporters on Thursday that Gabbard’s Georgia appearance only sparks more concerns that the raid “is an attempt to fuel false claims and disinformation.”</p> 
<p>“There is no reason for the director of national intelligence to be in any kind of voting site,” he said. “She has neither the authority nor the competence to assess anything in that voting site. And so it’s incredibly troubling to see something like that.”</p> 
<p>Mo Ivory, a Fulton County commissioner, said Thursday that federal officials took 700 boxes of ballots and “ancillary” materials from the 2020 election. The county’s attorney, she said, is “working with a group of local and national lawyers" to formulate a legal response.</p> 
<p>The first DOJ official said the ballots are now being stored at an FBI facility in Winchester, Virginia.</p> 
<p>Spokespeople for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not respond to requests for comment. In 2020, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/24/raffensperger-georgia-election-misinformation-00137372" target="_blank">Raffensperger famously rebuffed</a> Trump’s pressure campaign to “find” enough votes to flip the state’s election for him.</p> 
<p>The two DOJ officials said the FBI received a heads up that Gabbard would be on site for the raid. They said her participation did not bother FBI Director Kash Patel or other bureau officials.</p> 
<p>Democrats, however, worry more broadly that the raid could have a chilling effect on future elections.</p> 
<p>“The facts are clear, Trump lost, and he has to accept that and move on with his life,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in an interview. “And everyone in his administration should do the same, instead of terrorizing election officials and interfering with our work to simply just prepare for the midterm elections.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Thursday declined to say whether he would support Sen. John Fetterman if he runs for reelection in 2028, the latest twist in a fraught relationship between Pennnsylvania’s two most prominent Democrats.</p> 
<p>“John will decide if he’s going to run for reelection. I appreciate his service,” Shapiro said before quickly pivoting, when asked whether Fetterman is “someone that you admire and would support for reelection” at a Christian Science Monitor press event in Washington.</p> 
<p>Asked point-blank whether he liked Fetterman, Shapiro replied: “Of course. And we all work together to do good things for the people of Pennsylvania.”</p> 
<p>Fetterman has not yet said whether he will seek reelection in 2028. But progressives are already <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/politics/2025/11/working-families-party-pledges-support-john-fetterman-primary-challenger/409595/" target="_blank"><u>plotting a primary challenge</u></a> to him over his centrist congressional voting record that’s seen him cross party lines to support some of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks, give full-throated support for Israel and repeatedly buck Democrats during shutdown fights.</p> 
<p>The relationship between the top Pennsylvania Democrats and stylistic opposites has long been strained, though Fetterman has been much more public about his disdain for Shapiro than the other direction.</p> 
<p>Fetterman, in his 2025 memoir, criticized Shapiro for acting out of “political ambition” and <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/12/us-news/sen-john-fetterman-raged-at-fing-ahole-josh-shapiro-reveals-why-their-relationship-never-recovered-in-new-memoir/" target="_blank"><u>wrote that he was caught on a hot mic</u></a> calling Shapiro a “fucking asshole” during a Zoom meeting while serving together on the state’s pardon board. Fetterman wrote he wished Shapiro the best — but claimed the two “no longer speak.”</p> 
<p>Shapiro refuted that Thursday, saying “yes” the two are on speaking terms, adding that they were in a meeting together with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy “a few weeks ago … working on an important issue in Pennsylvania.”</p> 
<p>Shapiro makes just two mentions of Fetterman in his own memoir, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” which was released this week — both just passing mentions of the two being at the same political events. He notes the two spoke backstage at an Erie Democratic dinner days before Fetterman’s stroke.</p> 
<p>A representative for Fetterman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>State election officials were among the most visible defenders of American democracy after the 2020 election — standing up to President Donald Trump, rejecting false claims and, whether they wanted to or not, becoming national symbols of institutional resistance to his attempts to overturn his election loss.</p> 
<p>But as some run for governor in 2026, they are eager to talk about anything but 2020.</p> 
<p>More than five years after Trump’s attempt to cling to power ignited a political rallying cry on the left and a loyalty test on the right, these Republican and Democratic candidates are betting — and, in some cases, hoping — that voters have moved on.</p> 
<p>A pair of Republican secretaries of state who rejected Trump’s false 2020 election claims and then survived MAGA-fueled 2022 primaries are running for governor. Unsurprisingly, neither is keen to relitigate the issue that linger over their hopes this year.</p> 
<p>“2020 is very far behind us as secretaries of state,” Kansas Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab said. “We remember it, but we’re moving on, and I think the American public is too.”</p> 
<p>But Trump isn’t ready to move on, complicating these candidates’ hopes of putting 2020 in the rearview mirror. Speaking before an audience of global leaders and business officials in Davos last week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/trump-2020-election-prosecutions-00738778" target="_blank">Trump repeated his false claim</a> that the 2020 election was “rigged” and promised that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did.”</p> 
<p>Two Democratic secretaries of state are also running for the governor’s mansion. And while defending democracy and their defiance to Trump on election issues forms a defining part of their political biographies, both candidates lead with pocketbook issues rather than making protecting the vote the centerpiece.</p> 
<p>“This election is about Michigan, and this election is about who is best positioned to lower costs for the people in our state,” Michigan Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>In many ways, the shift reflects the reality of running for the governor’s mansion. The job description is much broader from the office of the secretary of state — and voters want to hear about what politicians will do for them now.</p> 
<p>But it also underscores the political evolution of one of the most animating aspects of Trump’s first term.</p> 
<p>For Democrats, democracy was a potent force in 2022, when candidates <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/24/election-deniers-secretary-of-state-00062383" target="_blank">leaned heavily into running against election deniers</a>. And many Democrats say it’s still effective.</p> 
<p>“They use the issue as an illustration of character,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. “It really communicates integrity, nonpartisanship, commitment to democracy and freedom, standing up for people, and courage.”</p> 
<p>As Democratic candidates’ use of democracy messaging has evolved, strategists say the meaning of “democracy” itself has also shifted since 2020. Then, it was largely about election integrity and the transfer of power. Now, it’s increasingly tied to broader concerns about executive authority, with Democrats arguing they’ll be the ones who can stand up to a president they see as authoritarian.</p> 
<p>“This is the moment where you need a governor who won't bend the knee,” said Benson, who has been outspoken against the Trump administration following back-to-back killings of protestors in Minnesota by federal agents.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/84/77/62a964ca48f79cf2c7810d4e0afe/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2170653219" alt="Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson speaks during a House Administration Committee hearing on " data-portal-copyright="Bonnie Cash/Getty Images" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="2170653219" data-licensor-name="Getty Images" data-title="Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson speaks during a House Administration Committee hearing on "/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Jocelyn Benson</h4> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium"></h5> 
<p>Benson was on the front lines of defending her state’s election results after 2020, facing threats and swatting attacks. That period is a part of her messaging: Her campaign launch video showed news footage of her home being surrounded by protesters, and she remains <a href="https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-2020-election-pardons-michigan-interference-rcna244664" target="_blank">outspoken</a> against false claims related to the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>She has also cast that moment as proof of leadership — and a willingness to stand up to Trump. “We fought back to protect democracy itself and we showed that as state officials, that's how we have to respond to bullies who try to rip away our rights no matter how powerful they may be,” she said.</p> 
<p>But on the campaign trail, Benson has often focused more on bread-and-butter economic issues. Affordability, housing, health care, childcare and energy costs are listed as her top issues on her campaign website.</p> 
<p>“What every resident, every citizen, every voter in this election knows is how important it is to have a governor who will fight for them and who will fight for them in a way that that effectively lowers their cost of living while also protecting the safety of themselves, their families and their communities,” Benson told POLITICO.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/d0/aa/2429e0244afcb5791a7831a19da2/election-2020-georgia-48074.jpg" alt="Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger speaks during a news conference in Atlanta, on Nov. 11, 2020, after state election officials announced an audit of the presidential election results." data-portal-copyright="Brynn Anderson/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="20316602548074" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger speaks during a news conference in Atlanta, on Nov. 11, 2020, after state election officials announced an audit of the presidential election results."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Brad Raffensperger</h4> 
<p>Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was one of the most prominent Republicans to reject Trump after the president urged him to “find” more votes in his state. The incident propelled him into the national spotlight — and drew <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/28/georgia-secretary-of-state-gop-478251" target="_blank">fury from the president and his MAGA base</a>, leading to death threats. He warded off a Trump-endorsed primary challenge in 2022, in part by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/24/raffensperger-georgia-reelection-conservative-media-00011224" target="_blank">taking his case</a> to conservative media. Now, he’s seeking the governor’s mansion in the state that is in many ways the epicenter of Trump’s bid to hold on to power in 2020.</p> 
<p>Raffensperger does not directly talk about the 2020 incident in his launch video or on his campaign website. Instead, he frames his record as evidence that he is willing to make the "tough decisions.” His launch video focuses on creating jobs in Georgia, lowering property taxes and banning transgender women from women sports, among other issues — issues that are key to voters but not central to his current day job.</p> 
<p>But Georgia’s 2020 election keeps getting pushed back into the spotlight.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249" target="_blank">FBI executed a search warrant</a> at the Fulton County elections office outside Atlanta, seizing all ballots from the 2020 election there.</p> 
<p>“He’s trying to talk about other issues, [but] 2020 keeps coming up,” said Buzz Brockway, a former Republican state legislator who lost to Raffensperger in a 2018 primary.</p> 
<p>Brockway said many Republicans have moved on from 2020 — but that there remains a “loud, noisy contingent who are continuing that battle” that Raffensperger will have to contend with, even if most voters’ main focus lies elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Raffensperger has largely sidestepped questions about the 2020 election — in a November <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/politically-georgia-live-brad-raffensperger-on-passing-the-2020-test/" target="_blank">interview with the Atlanta-Journal Constitution</a>, he said that it showed that he does the “right thing, no matter what.”</p> 
<p>“Other people haven’t been put to that test, but we were at the end of the day," he said.</p> 
<p>Raffensperger’s campaign declined to comment for this story.</p> 
<p>Still, Raffensperger’ opponents in the GOP primary, particularly Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, are eager to keep 2020 alive in the race. Jones, who was a fake elector in the state, has tried to cast his actions during that period as unflinching loyalty to the president.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know that it brings Jones any new voters,” Brockway said, but it may be an effort to “energize his base.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/46/ab/cfad2edd4434b48c8bc762a38219/election-2022-kansas-secretary-of-state-42813.jpg" alt="Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab takes the stage for his victory speech after winning reelection during a watch party in Topeka, Kansas, in 2022." data-portal-copyright="Reed Hoffmann/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="22313162342813" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab takes the stage for his victory speech after winning reelection during a watch party in Topeka, Kansas, in 2022."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Scott Schwab</h4> 
<p>In ruby-red Kansas, Schwab defied some of the loudest voices in his party when he repeatedly rejected false claims about the 2020 election in his role as secretary of state. He has been clear that he does not see that chapter as central to his gubernatorial bid as he runs in a crowded GOP primary.</p> 
<p>“Everybody’s concerned about taxes, especially with cost of living,” Schwab, a past <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/16/nass-secretaries-state-election-bipartisanship-00141840" target="_blank">chair of the National Association of Secretaries of State</a>, said in an interview. “Property taxes are a real red-hot button in Kansas.”</p> 
<p>His campaign launch video only briefly mentions election issues, and almost as an afterthought. “As secretary of state, I streamlined business services and cut bureaucratic red tape,” he said. “I secured our elections, too.”</p> 
<p>There remains a segment of the GOP for whom election issues remain salient, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Kansas. But for the broader electorate — those most likely to turn out in midterm elections — these issues are still “pretty low down the list.”</p> 
<p>In 2022, Schwab, Raffensperger and Benson all prevailed in their reelections, despite facing Trump-backed challengers or outright election deniers.</p> 
<p>“I would say that most people really believe that we've moved on,” Schwab said.</p><img src="https://static.politico.com/47/81/7b03ade04febac7b9570f38bb14e/trump-elections-commission-46277.jpg" alt="Main Secretary of State Shenna Bellows speaks at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board in-person public meeting in Charlotte North Carolina in April 2025." data-portal-copyright="Chris Carlson/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="25114535946277" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Main Secretary of State Shenna Bellows speaks at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board in-person public meeting in Charlotte North Carolina in April 2025."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Shenna Bellows</h4> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium"></h5> 
<p>Democrat Secretary of State Shenna Bellows became Maine secretary of state in January 2021 after being chosen by the state legislature, just as Trump was in the middle of his push to overturn his election loss. In 2023, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/29/shenna-bellows-maine-trump-ballot-00133332" target="_blank">she ruled that Trump</a> should be barred from the ballot for his conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court.</p> 
<p>In the blue-leaning state, and facing a crowded primary, Bellows has been more eager to talk about the issue than some of her fellow chief election officials.</p> 
<p>“Leadership is about doing what is right, even when it is hard,” she said in her launch video, which highlighted the threats and harassment she faced as a result of her decision.</p> 
<p>In her bid for governor, she has emphasized that anger over Trump’s actions exists in tandem with persistent anxiety about the economy. Like Benson, she has been vocal in criticizing the killings in Minnesota.</p> 
<p>“The economy is the number one issue for most Mainers, there's a lot of economic concern right now, especially in the wake of the tariffs and increasing job losses that we're about to see,” she told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“That being said, I also think it's really important to tell the truth,” she said. “What the Trump decision and my work as secretary and defending democracy tells people about me is that I will do the right thing even when it's hard.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Republicans have had some reliable <i>terra firma:</i> If they were talking about immigration and border security, they were winning.</p> 
<p>Even amid the backlash from Donald Trump’s 2016 pledge to ban all Muslim immigrants to his 2024 amplification of baseless claims that migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets—immigration remained a durable, winning issue for the GOP.</p> 
<p>Now the ground is shifting under them.</p> 
<p>A torrent of viral images from Minnesota and beyond as Trump’s immigration agents stepped up their shambolic interior campaign of enforcement in recent months — and the killing of two people in Minneapolis in two separate incidents this past month — have led to a loud public backlash, soured voters on the GOP’s approach and eroded President Donald Trump’s standing on the issue ahead of the looming midterms.</p> 
<p>The broad sweep of public polling shows Trump fumbling what has historically been his party’s strongest issue, which even Democrats concede paved his path back to the White House. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-approval-drops-record-low-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-26/" target="_blank">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> found this week Trump hit a second-term trough on the issue, with a majority of Americans — 58 percent — saying his crackdown has gone too far. Only 39 percent approve of his handling of immigration, down two points from earlier this month, and an 11-point erosion from last February. What’s more, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/ice-polling-memo-searchlight-00751569" target="_blank">a poll</a> from the Democratic-aligned Searchlight Institute this week found that 58 percent of likely midterm voters want ICE to be reined in.</p> 
<p>"The image that has been created is not a good thing," said Jose Arango, the Republican chair of Hudson County, New Jersey, a heavily Democratic area with a large Hispanic population that shifted rightward in 2024. "We're losing in the public relations campaign."</p> 
<p>Even before Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis, Trump’s own voters were fretting over his agenda. A plurality of Americans said the president’s mass deportation campaign is too aggressive — including 1 in 5 voters who backed Trump in 2024, according to the latest <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668" target="_blank">POLITICO Poll</a>. More than 1 in 3 Trump voters said that while they support his immigration agenda, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.</p> 
<p>And <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-0762-d9a8-a7be-87e22d550000" target="_blank">another new round of polling</a> on Thursday could give Democrats more ammo as voters move away from Trump’s immigration agenda. The Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC’s latest polling, shared exclusively with POLITICO and being sent to lawmakers, donors and campaigns Thursday, shows not only a growing number of likely voters who disapprove of ICE, but also a majority in favor of Democrats’ strategy of demands for reform <i>even if</i> it means a partial government shutdown, with 54 percent also saying they would blame the GOP and Trump for the shutdown and not accepting ICE reforms. These numbers are especially telling as the biggest shifts occur “among moderates, non-MAGA Republicans, and key swing voters,” the polling memo said.</p> 
<p>As former President Joe Biden and his administration officials left themselves electorally exposed on the issue, then-candidate Donald Trump exploited those vulnerabilities with vows to seal the southern border and enact the largest deportation campaign in American history. But his enforcement actions have focused less on the border, which polls show most voters approve of, and more on the nation’s interior, drawing the ire of Trump-curious commentators like the comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan and raising alarm among Republicans.</p> 
<p>“The president can feel, generally, that his policies at the border have been largely supported by a majority of Americans. But what he’s doing inside the border seems to be not working,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/republican-mayors-trump-ice-00754195" target="_blank">said Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt</a>, a Republican who runs one of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2014/08/08/chart-of-the-week-the-most-liberal-and-conservative-big-cities/" target="_blank">most conservative large cities in the nation</a> but backed Kamala Harris in 2024.</p> 
<p>One longtime Republican strategist who worked on presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2024, granted anonymity to candidly assess Republicans’ standing, expressed consternation over ICE’s deployment to a place like Minnesota, far from the southern border.</p> 
<p>“When I think of immigrants broadly, I don’t think of Minnesota,” the strategist said. “People want to see, like, okay, ‘I voted for taking criminal illegal immigrants and getting them out of the country. I want to see criminal illegal immigrants taken out of the country. I want to see more miles of wall being built.’ I feel like we talked about the wall weekly in Trump 1. I don't remember the last time we talked about the wall in Trump 2.”</p> 
<p>All of which raises an uncomfortable question for Republicans: Is the party in danger of ceding one of its best issues back to Democrats?</p> 
<p>“Immigration used to be a winning issue for Democrats back when we made clear we took enforcement seriously,” said Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) and top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who commissioned the Searchlight polling shared with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as he shuttled toward another potential shutdown over the issue. “It can be a winning issue for us again if we are smart about how we handle this.</p> 
<p>Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a rising Democratic star who won his seat in 2024 at the same time Trump carried his state, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ruben-gallego-democrats-latino-senator-ab9b48c24fcdbc4eb54bcddc48a82a66" target="_blank">campaigned in key Latino areas</a> for his party in New Jersey, Virginia and Miami’s mayoral elections last year, and who has launched his own <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/ruben-gallego-immigration-border-security-plan-00341242" target="_blank">border security and immigration platform</a>, told POLITICO his party has to build trust with swing voters.</p> 
<p>“We have to be the party that talks about professional, legal enforcement of our immigration laws with an understanding that criminals need to be deported and the border needs to be secure, and that we have to move to a sane compromise when it comes to immigration reform,” Gallego said.</p> 
<p>It wasn’t so long ago that was the reality: As recently as 2013, under then-President Barack Obama, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2013/07/poll-democrats-winning-on-immigration-024052" target="_blank">the majority of Americans</a> said the Democratic Party better represents their feelings on immigration than Republicans did.</p> 
<p>What does the GOP risk ahead of the midterms if it doesn’t find a better message?</p> 
<p>“I think you'll see the numbers continue to suffer,” the longtime GOP strategist said.</p> 
<p>Gallego, who has called for White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller to be fired, said that gives Democrats an opportunity.</p> 
<p>“If I was the Republicans right now, I would be very worried about what the future looks like in terms of elections, and Stephen Miller may have basically created a political tsunami among voters, both Latino voters as well as just kind of moderate voters,” Gallego said. “That's going to come back and haunt them, going into the 2026 election.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of Republican mayors are condemning the Trump administration’s hardline immigration enforcement tactics in Minnesota, as they call on the president to pull back from Minneapolis and worry their cities might be next.</p> 
<p>“It’s roiling the country,” Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told POLITICO. “We're all sort of feeling the angst of our residents and the fear that our city will be next and that chaos is going to inevitably creep across the entire country.”</p> 
<p>Fresno, California, Mayor Jerry Dyer said in an interview that “too much damage has been done” with the crackdown and “the trust in communities has been lost.”</p> 
<p>And Burnsville, Minnesota, Mayor Elizabeth Kautz, warned that the agency’s current tactics meant “our cities are no longer safe.”</p> 
<p>The remarks from the trio of moderate-leaning GOP mayors who have broken with Trump in the past came at the annual gathering of the nonpartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors, held blocks from the White House. Holt chairs the conference.</p> 
<p>The Republican leaders’ calls for Trump to deescalate after the fatal shootings of two Minnesotans by federal agents show the GOP’s deepening fissures over the administration’s aggressive immigration agenda, even as the mayors and Republicans broadly offered support for the president’s overall goal. And their alarm comes as ICE ramps up operations in other states, including Arizona and Maine.</p> 
<p>The escalating immigration enforcement crackdown hung over the annual gathering, dominating conversations among leaders who are scrambling to prepare their cities for ICE sweeps and allay anxious and outraged residents.</p> 
<p>Dyer on Wednesday said federal agents need to receive more training in deescalation tactics — a practice that the Fresno mayor, who served in law enforcement for 40 years, including 18 as the city's police chief, said is integral for local police departments. He also said federal agencies should only work in communities where they have the cooperation of local leaders.</p> 
<p>“I don't believe that agencies should be deployed into cities against the will of local government and without the cooperation of local law enforcement,” Dyer said. “That’s a recipe for disaster, and I believe that's somewhat of what we're seeing today.”</p> 
<p>And he urged other Republicans to speak out against federal immigration agents’ recent tactics.</p> 
<p>“The Republican Party in general cannot rubber-stamp everything a party does or this administration does,” Dyer said. “Too many people today are turning a blind eye when they should be speaking out in opposition.”</p> 
<p>It wasn’t just big-city GOP mayors who were concerned with the administration’s response: Kautz’s town of 64,000 people is in Minneapolis’ south suburbs.</p> 
<p>Kautz, who said she now carries her passport in public, called for ICE to use judicial warrants, arguing that while violent criminals need to be off the street, it needs to be done “through proper channels, the rule of law, due process [and rooted] in the Constitution.” In Minnesota, “that is not our experience.”</p> 
<p>A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668" target="_blank">new POLITICO poll</a> found that more than 1 in 3 Trump voters said that while they support the goals of his immigration agenda, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.</p> 
<p>Holt, who runs one of the most conservative large cities in the U.S. but backed Kamala Harris over Trump in 2024, warned that Trump’s interior enforcement was a failure.</p> 
<p>“The president can feel, generally, that his policies at the border have been largely supported by a majority of Americans,” Holt said. “But what he's doing inside the border seems to be not working.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats could face a gloomy Electoral College atmosphere next decade, according to new population estimates released Tuesday that show red-leaning states like Texas and Florida making major gains and California as a big loser.</p> 
<p>By combining <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2026/population-growth-slows.html" target="_blank">the census bureau’s new state population estimates</a> for 2025 with previous years’ data, experts quickly projected the number of House seats — and Electoral College votes — states will gain or lose after the 2030 Census in the process known as reapportionment. And while those projections differ slightly, they all had bad news for Democrats: GOP-leaning states will gain electoral power and Democratic-leaning states will lose it if the trends continue.</p> 
<p>While Joe Biden would still have won in 2020 under the estimates, two projected maps show Democrats would no longer be able to win the Electoral College by relying solely on the Rust Belt battleground states.</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/RedistrictNet/status/2016161865550659995" target="_blank">One of the estimates from Jonathan Cervas</a>, a redistricting and apportionment expert at Carnegie Mellon University, shows seat changes across the map, with Florida and Texas gaining four seats each, while California, New York and Illinois collectively lose eight.</p> 
<p>Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah and Idaho would all pick up one more seat, while Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island lose one seat.</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/amerredistrict/status/2016151110235423153?s=46&amp;t=Gn4QXkIC7rHYnzzbMwY5Vg" target="_blank">Another map</a> from the GOP-aligned American Redistricting Project shows less seats shifting overall, with Texas gaining four seats, Florida gaining two, and Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah and Idaho gaining one. Under that estimate, California loses four seats, and New York, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island all lose one seat.</p> 
<p>In both models, the shifts — which are significant in both projections given the already razor-thin margins in the House — stand to alter the battlefield for the 2032 presidential campaign and the fight for the House down-ballot.</p> 
<p>While the changes are “not going to lock in” GOP wins, the map is certainly shifting in their favor, said Adam Kincaid, president of the National Republican Redistricting Trust.</p> 
<p>“The Rust Belt states and Sun Belt states will continue to be the battleground,” he said. “The difference is that Republicans will be able to win the White House without a single Rust Belt state, whereas Democrats would have to sweep the Rust Belt and win in the Sun Belt.”</p> 
<p>The new maps are mostly in line <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/newsletter/2025/07/an-early-look-at-2030-reapportionment-00438139" target="_blank">with earlier estimates from Democrats</a>, who at the time presented changes to Florida and Texas specifically as the “result of population growth specifically in diverse, metropolitan, Democratic-leaning urban centers.”</p> 
<p>That is leaving the party with some tempered optimism about their fate in the Electoral College and the battle for House control.</p> 
<p>“As these folks are moving, they're bringing their politics with them,” said Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “And so I think it's not necessarily safe to assume that those population shifts don't or aren't able to impact statewide results.”</p> 
<p>But not everyone in the party saw good news between the lines. Plus, Democrats have long hoped population shifts in red states like Texas and Florida would lead to gains for the party, but so far that wish has not materialized.</p> 
<p>David Hogg, the former DNC vice chair who has embarked on a mission to primary members of his party that he believes are not doing enough to stand up to President Donald Trump, said the estimates prove that the party must invest further in the South.</p> 
<p>“If we don’t start building infrastructure in the South … we can kiss goodbye any chance of winning the white house in the 2030s,” <a href="https://x.com/davidhogg111/status/2016193134196129843?s=20" target="_blank">Hogg said on X</a>.</p> 
<p>The shifts also amplify fears from Democrats that Republicans will try and gerrymander urban areas and lessen those voters’ impact in House races, something Jenkins said is designed to “dilute the voices of these communities.”</p> 
<p>“We're going to find in states like Texas is that as those communities grow, it's going to become harder and harder for [Republicans] to gerrymander their way out of the fact that those people live there, and they're real people,” she said.</p> 
<p>Jenkins said it’s important to understand the projections “in the context of this effort to gerrymander the country into oblivion,” pointing to the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/31/the-redistricting-fight-that-dominated-american-politics-in-2025-00703193" target="_blank">White House-initiated mid-cycle redistricting effort</a> that swept the country last year.</p> 
<p>But both parties acknowledge there’s still plenty of time for populations to shift even more before the numbers are locked in during the 2030 Census.</p> 
<p>Ahead of the 2020 Census, reapportionment projections were dire for Democratic-controlled states. But the shifts ended up <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/26/census-house-apportionment-for-next-decade-484653" target="_blank">being less dramatic than anticipated</a> — in part due to an undercount of Black, Hispanic and Native American people, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/10/2020-census-undercount-black-people-hispanics-native-americans-00016138" target="_blank">the Census Bureau acknowledged</a>, that was partially triggered by the extraordinarily difficult task of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/27/census-latinos-count-484846" target="_blank">counting every American during a pandemic</a>.</p> 
<p>“It's basically halftime,” Kincaid said. “We've got 5 years to go. A lot can change.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The group behind the nationwide “No Kings” protests are planning their fourth demonstration of President Donald Trump’s second term — and are anticipating even greater turnout than their earlier rallies.</p> 
<p>Ezra Levin, a rally organizer and the co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said in an interview that the planned third “No Kings” protest on March 28 is in response to a “secret police force terrorizing American communities.”</p> 
<p>“It is unfortunately not a surprise to us that this lawless police force is committing crimes all across the country and that people are standing up to it,” said Levin. “Our goal is safeguarding American democracy, protecting our communities and the people who are under threat by this regime.”</p> 
<p>Nationwide protests have become a staple of both of President Donald Trump’s terms. Indivisible estimated 3 million protesters turned out for its “Hands Off” rally in April 2025, while 5 million showed up in June as part of the first “No Kings” protest and 7 million for the second “No Kings” demonstration in October.</p> 
<p>Organizers said they are aiming for nearly 9 million people to turn out in March.</p> 
<p>Levin said that Indivisible had been planning the upcoming protest since before Renee Good was shot and killed by an immigration officer in Minnesota earlier this month, calling <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-trump-administration-dueling-accounts-minneapolis-shooting-00745811?utm_campaign=mb&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morning_brew" target="_blank">what is unfolding in the Midwestern state</a> is “tragic and horrific.” A second person, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minnesota-tim-walz-shooting-minneapolis-00745570" target="_blank">Alex Pretti, was killed by Border Patrol agents</a> on Saturday not far from where Good died.</p> 
<p>Still, Levin said, it is “inspiring and gives me hope that while this regime and many political leaders even outside this regime are cowards or fascist sympathizers, people on the ground aren't putting up with it.”</p> 
<p>Trump and his GOP allies have not been fans of the demonstrations. Ahead of the October marches — which took place amid the government shutdown — Speaker Mike Johnson called <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/no-kings-protest-mike-johnson-00602705" target="_blank">them “hate America” rallies</a>, and Trump’s “war room” account posted a mocking picture of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/18/no-kings-rallies-trump-washington-00613973" target="_blank">president wearing a crown</a>.</p> 
<p>Levin said the organizers are taking safety precautions, including holding de-escalation training sessions. On Monday, the group held a session on non-violent documentation techniques for the public. And at the last “No Kings” protest, Levin said Indivisible trained thousands of volunteer marshals, emphasizing non-violent principles.</p> 
<p>The tactics have a proven track record, Levin argued, with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/20/arrests-no-kings-new-york-austin-chicago-dc-san-diego-trump-administration-police" target="_blank">major cities reporting zero arrests</a> during the last “No Kings” demonstration.</p> 
<p>Still, Levin said, he can’t guarantee there aren’t risks to participating.</p> 
<p>“Based on how the regime is behaving, the fact of the matter is, everybody should worry about it,” he said. “I can't guarantee that there isn’t a risk involved to show up and exercise your constitutional rights. It's a terrible thing to have to say in 2026 in America, but it's the truth.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats should “play hardball” ahead of a looming partial government shutdown and use their “leverage to reform ICE,” according to a new <a href="https://www.searchlightinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Memo-Play-Hardball-and-Use-Your-Leverage-to-Reform-ICE.pdf" target="_blank">polling memo</a> circulating among Democratic senators Tuesday.</p> 
<p>The polling, in the field January 23 to 26 during the height of public backlash to Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis, found that 58 percent of likely midterm voters want ICE to be reined in. More voters prefer reforming ICE than the number who prefer eliminating the agency entirely by 30 percent to 19 percent, according to the survey shared first with POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“Voters want ICE to follow the law, and focus enforcement on people who pose a threat to public safety. They want to see tangible changes to ICE operations and oppose letting ICE detain U.S. citizens, enter homes without warrants, or fail to wear identifying uniforms,” according to the memo. “There is a desire for immigration enforcement that is lawful, reasonable, and effective. “</p> 
<p>The memo was written by Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) and top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), for his organization the Searchlight Institute, which conducted the 1,502-person online survey alongside Tavern Research.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/03/dems-are-quietly-forming-a-think-tank-to-help-them-win-again-00381601" target="_blank">The influential new think tank</a> seeks to push the Democratic Party toward broadly popular positions, regardless of ideology. In the case of ICE, Jentleson writes, Democrats should embrace reforming, not abolishing, the agency.</p> 
<p>“Democrats should use their leverage to demand commonsense reforms to ICE that have the backing of broad bipartisan majorities of Americans,” Jentleson writes in the memo, which came across the desk of aides to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday and continued to make the rounds among Senate Democrats early Wednesday.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Searchlight’s latest survey finds that “bipartisan majorities of voters oppose ICE’s lawless tactics, including detaining U.S. citizens (73 percent), entering people’s homes without warrants (79 percent), and failing to wear clearly identifying uniforms (70 percent)”, according to the memo.</p> 
<p>The polling comes as Senate Democrats are <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/cuellar-dhs-blank-check-00749995" target="_blank">demanding to re-negotiate</a> a hulking DHS funding bill ahead of a Friday midnight deadline for a partial government shutdown, carving it off from a six-bill appropriations package.</p> 
<p>“This is likely to be their last major leverage point for several months at least if not for the rest of the year” to curtail the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Jentleson told POLITICO. “But there’s a larger reason, which is that the tragic events that have unfolded in Minneapolis have shocked the conscience of Americans and brought their attention to the horrible shit that ICE is doing. Those two things combined give them a lot of leverage at this moment.”</p> 
<p>Democratic likely midterm voters were split in the poll over how to change ICE, with 34 percent favoring reforming ICE and 33 percent wanting to get rid of it as an agency — meaning that it’s “a coin flip among Democrats,” Jentleson said. That indicates that in contested Democratic primaries, it’s not clear which side of that debate will have the edge with base voters.</p> 
<p>What’s clearer, he wrote in the memo, is that voters do support some degree of immigration enforcement. The memo notes that the view that “immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should not be deported” receives no more than 30 percent support among Democrats and young people, and even less among other groups.</p> 
<p>Senate Democrats have embraced this push.</p> 
<p>Speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday, Schumer seemed to set the predicate for the partial shutdown, saying any administrative actions on ICE wouldn’t be enough and that “any fix should come from Congress. The public can’t trust the administration to do the right thing on its own and the Republicans and Democrats must work together to make that happen.”</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans face a Friday midnight deadline to avert a shutdown. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have said that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be fired. President Donald Trump acknowledged shaking up his border security leadership team Tuesday.</p> 
<p>“Senate Democrats should embrace this reality and use their leverage to achieve meaningful changes that rein in ICE’s abuses and refocus the agency on its critical law enforcement mission,” Jentleson writes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The RNC distributed talking points highlighting Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino’s false statements about the killing of Alex Pretti just hours before he was sidelined by President Donald Trump — a sign of how quickly the party’s messaging has shifted on the events in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-01f7-d9a8-a7be-87f729550001" target="_blank">The memo</a>, sent to party surrogates midday on Monday and obtained by POLITICO, encouraged Republicans to cast blame for the shooting on Democrats for “inciting protestors to attack and aggressively confront law enforcement in Minneapolis.” The talking points also delve into administration officials’ account of how the shooting took place, including Bovino’s Saturday comments that the U.S. citizen killed by immigration agents “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement." The government’s initial account has been called into question by videos shot by witnesses as well as analyses conducted by The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-federal-agents-video.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/minneapolis-shooting-alex-pretti/card/wsj-visual-investigation-videos-contradict-u-s-account-of-minneapolis-shooting-lrNpSm80hhnrxVxEy7kO?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqeMfXHa-r5f_coUtyWU2TDX_pUwGzct7ciQYXf_QuPsBeDX-5YqhaQBv69a5x8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69793983&amp;gaa_sig=DSspyLz-8HCs-CWTnsRr3TjzrIBrFPt1TzRmBugZwzesss81GIE8xUHvg0x1nkczT8b97u7hD1yc8-EZ9pRSsg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>, and others.</p> 
<p>The memo includes the talking point that “Agents attempted to disarm the individual as he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a Border Patrol agent fired defensive shots.” Video from the scene appears to contradict that statement.</p> 
<p>The whiplash between the RNC’s promotion of Bovino’s comments and his sudden removal shortly afterward from the federal operation in Minneapolis shows how the administration and other Republicans scrambled to contain the fallout from the shooting. A significant number of elected GOP officials have called for an official investigation into the matter, a rare and notable break with the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>Immediately following the shooting on Saturday, high-profile administration officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem publicly described Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/leavitt-briefing-minneapolis-trump-walz-alex-pretti-00747495" target="_blank">“domestic terrorist.”</a></p> 
<p>By that evening, however, Trump was already more cautious in his description of what had transpired. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-administration-is-reviewing-everything-about-minneapolis-shooting-a501f48e?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcZVoLjAgLS_LENGeVH-NWCqZFB9zgFqjGu85ixp9xYdgMDpDSXuPw2gtxFkd8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69792383&amp;gaa_sig=nUi-HJXipOVQ2Rgqh7-IB_Dhu-dAq4sY2s6SwobYlLst1e3NtzUYThMdV4gHRtW4R2uldBGkMhRutTfX9moJxA%3D%3D" target="_blank">In an interview that day with The Wall Street Journal</a>, the president did not answer directly when asked whether the officer involved in the shooting did the right thing and said his administration is “reviewing everything.”</p> 
<p>Speaking at a restaurant in Iowa on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/trump-pretti-shouldnt-have-been-carrying-a-gun-00750241" target="_blank">Trump said that he hadn’t heard the assessment</a> from Noem and others in his administration, such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” or assassin, but said that “certainly he shouldn’t have been carrying a gun.” Pretti had a permit to carry a firearm, according to Minnesota officials.</p> 
<p>Monday’s talking points memo notably omits reference to any comments made by Noem since the shooting took place. While the White House has publicly stood behind Noem, administration allies have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/kristi-noem-scrutiny-minneapolis-shootings-00748618" target="_blank">increasingly placed blame on the secretary’s handling of the chaotic crackdown in Minnesota</a> as calls among Democrats for her impeachment have grown. <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/thom-tillis-kristi-noem-fired-00750580" target="_blank">On Tuesday evening</a>, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Noem should be “out of a job,” while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she “should go.”</p> 
<p>Trump announced on Monday morning that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/trump-border-czar-minneapolis-00746125" target="_blank">border czar Tom Homan would go to Minneapolis</a> to oversee the administration’s immigration operation there, a move seen as an acknowledgement that DHS’s leadership had mishandled the situation. Hours later, Bovino had been removed from his post as commander at large, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/" target="_blank">according to The Atlantic</a>.</p> 
<p>Kiersten Pels, a spokesperson for the RNC, would not confirm the authenticity of the memo but echoed its overall sentiment in a written statement. “Democrats incited this violence by encouraging protesters to confront law enforcement,” she wrote. “Democrats are demonizing ICE and threatening to defund DHS instead of condemning attacks on officers – while President Trump and Republicans stand with law enforcement and public safety.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s approval rating on immigration has dropped significantly since he first came into office, with only 39% of Americans now approving of the president’s handling of immigration, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-approval-drops-record-low-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-26/" target="_blank">recent Reuters/Ipsos poll</a>. The high-profile shooting in Minneapolis, following the fatal shooting earlier this month of Renée Good in the city, has only brought more attention to the administration’s goal of a mass deportation.</p> 
<p>Democrats in the Senate have pledged to vote against funding DHS in a crucial vote later this week unless the bill is amended to add guardrails for the agency — and the RNC’s talking points seize on the potential for a partial government shutdown as well.</p> 
<p>“Now, Democrats are threatening to defund law enforcement later this week by refusing to pass a DHS funding bill,” the memo concludes.</p> 
<p>“While Democrats will stand in the way of ICE and law enforcement to defend terrorists and criminal aliens, President Trump and Republicans are working to keep our communities safe.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUGUSTA, Maine — Gov. Janet Mills issued a dire warning in her annual address to state lawmakers Tuesday night: The federal immigration raids sweeping the state are part of an ongoing nationwide attack on democracy.</p> 
<p>The speech from Mills, who is a leading Democratic challenger to Republican Sen. Susan Collins, marks perhaps the most prominent example of how the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids have upended communities — and potentially electoral politics — around the country. The crackdown has become a political crisis for the White House in recent days following two fatal shootings by federal officers in Minnesota.</p> 
<p>“Today, I say to the people of Maine: We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced,” Mills said, to cheers from the Democratic side of the chamber. “And to anyone outside these halls, including any federal officials, I say: If you seek to harm Maine people, you will have to go through me first.”</p> 
<p>The Democratic governor’s defiant State of the State address on Tuesday came as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/ice-maine-dhs-trump-00740138" target="_blank">a sweeping ICE operation in Maine</a> has prompted widespread protests throughout the state since it began last week. The killing of a protester in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers this weekend has amplified those pressures — and the political stakes.</p> 
<p>Mills addressed the ICE operation directly in the opening of her speech, commending the “moral clarity” of Mainers who had risen to “protect their neighbors and their communities against federal agents who seek to intimidate and silence us.”</p> 
<p>Federal officials indicated Monday that <a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/immigration/2026-01-26/ice-says-its-arrested-more-than-200-people-since-last-week-in-maine-operation" target="_blank">more than 200 people had been arrested</a> in the immigrant enforcement action in Maine they’re calling Operation Catch of the Day. That effort has followed a pattern of surges in other localities under President Donald Trump’s aggressive revamped enforcement operations.</p> 
<p>Mills, who has made opposition to Trump a centerpiece of her Senate campaign, cast the immigration enforcement operation as part of a broader federal overreach that threatens American democracy in Tuesday’s speech — warning “the very idea of America is in peril.” She accused federal officials of arresting people not on “public safety grounds but based on quotas, on skin color, on accents, and religion and ethnic origin.”</p> 
<p>“For those who may be unconcerned by the federal government’s abuses of today, affecting our state, I only ask you to consider this — what happens when the federal government finds you to be the problem tomorrow?” Mills said, her voice rising and cracking with emotion in a departure from the more soft-spoken tone she had adopted while ticking through the policy points of her speech.</p> 
<p>Much of Mills’ speech was met with partisan reaction in the House chamber in Augusta, with some Republican lawmakers audibly pushing back at Mills’ notion that ICE activities amounted to an abuse of power. Earlier in her speech, Republican state Rep. Jim Thorne interrupted Mills’ call for the federal government to enact universal health care, suggesting it was out of place for a State of the State speech.</p> 
<p>Mills’ address to the legislature came days after <a href="https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-janet-mills-statement-following-another-killing-minnesota-hands-federal-agents-2026" target="_blank">she asked for a meeting with Trump</a> to call for a withdrawal of ICE agents from Maine. The Maine governor famously confronted Trump at the Oval Office last year over his administration’s intent to withhold federal funding from Maine over the state’s allowance of transgender students’ participation in youth sports.</p> 
<p>The politics of Trump’s deportation campaign have rapidly evolved in the wake of two shootings in Minnesota, putting ICE at the forefront of both the Democratic primary between Mills and political newcomer Graham Platner, and their efforts to unseat Collins.</p> 
<p>Collins — who has conflicted with the Trump administration more than most Republicans — <a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2026-01-27/susan-collins-asks-dhs-to-pause-immigration-enforcement-surge-in-maine-and-minnesota" target="_blank">told Maine Public</a> on Tuesday that she had asked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to pause the immigration enforcement surge in both Maine and Minnesota, calling it sweeping and indiscriminate. Those detained in Maine have included a corrections officer trainee who the Cumberland County sheriff <a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/courts-and-crime/2026-01-22/cumberland-county-sheriff-kevin-joyce-denounces-actions-by-ice-agents-in-maine" target="_blank">said had a legal work permit</a>.</p> 
<p>Mills has called on Collins to join with Democrats in holding up DHS funding until ICE changes course. Minutes before her speech, she <a href="https://x.com/JanetMillsforME/status/2016278711759253867?s=20" target="_blank">castigated Collins</a> on social media for <a href="https://x.com/JanetMillsforME/status/2016299356584890596?s=20" target="_blank">not calling for Noem’s ouster</a> and for “pushing to give the agency more funding without any accountability.” Collins oversees ICE’s purse strings as the Senate’s top appropriator, and she has advocated for passing the DHS funding bill as a Saturday shutdown deadline looms, saying it includes new guardrails for ICE such as body cameras and training and would fund other key agencies such as FEMA and the Coast Guard.</p> 
<p>The Democratic governor has also faced criticism from her left, with Platner attacking her Monday for her handling of a bill last year that sought to limit law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p> 
<p>Platner blasted Mills in an interview Monday for letting the bill idle, saying the governor “stymied the state’s ability to prepare” for the surge of federal immigration agents that “many in the immigrant rights community and the immigrant community knew … was coming” by preventing the law from taking effect sooner.</p> 
<p>Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature in December, which means it does not officially take effect until after the end of this year’s legislative session. However, the Portland Press Herald <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2026/01/21/a-new-anti-ice-law-isnt-in-effect-yet-maine-state-police-are-already-following-it/" target="_blank">reported earlier this month</a> that Maine’s public safety commissioner had implemented a directive to immediately comply with the law’s provisions.</p> 
<p>Platner dismissed her escalating rhetoric against ICE as politically convenient.</p> 
<p>“For the governor now to kind of just read the tea leaves and realize that people are actually really angry about this and want to see action, and then suddenly be like ‘I’m fighting this tooth and nail’ while not even fighting tooth and nail … yeah, that’s going to be a pretty clear distinction for the voters of Maine,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Virginia state court blocked Democrats’ plans to redistrict this year, a blow to the party’s hopes of redrawing the state’s congressional lines ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>Jack Hurley Jr., a judge on the Tazewell County circuit court, ruled that Democrats did <a href="https://www.virginiascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CL25001582-00-PO-95_Certified.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"><u>not follow the right procedure</u></a> to approve the proposed constitutional amendment that would allow for the last-minute redraw of the state’s lines.</p> 
<p>Democrats are expected to appeal the decision. But the ruling is still a major loss for the party in the ongoing mid-decade redistricting fight, and one that could — if ultimately upheld — block the party from picking up as many as four seats in next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>Democrats in the Legislature first passed a measure to take up redistricting <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/31/virginia-senate-approves-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment-in-party-line-vote/" target="_blank"><u>in October of last year</u></a>, utilizing a special session left open by then-Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Lawmakers <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/16/virginia-redistricting-legislature-00733644" target="_blank"><u>took up the issue again in January</u></a>, finalizing the plan to put the issue before voters ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>But Hurley said using the still-open special session was not allowed because early voting in last year’s elections had already begun, and state law requires the Legislature to pass proposed constitutional amendments both before and after an election. Hurley also ruled that the proposed constitutional amendment was not properly noticed in state courts.</p> 
<p>The judge also noted that lawmakers in the special session passed a procedural resolution along party lines, with the Democrat-controlled legislature delivering the decisive votes for the resolution’s passage. Because lawmakers did not vote unanimously, as is required under the Legislature’s own rules, and did not pass it by a two-thirds Senate majority, it was a violation of the rules governing a special session.</p> 
<p>“Certinaly, both houses of the Commonwealth’s legislature are required to follow their own rules and resolutions,” Hurley wrote.</p> 
<p>The Republican plaintiffs in the suit issued a statement praising the court’s ruling, calling it a “decisive victory for the rule of law” but also noting this legal challenge was not about partisanship, rather the process the majority used in attempting to rewrite Virginia’s Constitution.</p> 
<p>"The court confirmed that Democrat legislative leaders unlawfully expanded a Special Session, violated their own rules, and attempted to force through a redistricting constitutional amendment while Virginians were already voting,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the top Republican in the Virginia House, state Sen. Minority Leader Ryan McDougle and former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said in a joint statement Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Virginia had been seen as the crown jewel in Democrats' redistricting fight, especially as state Republicans in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/desantis-florida-redistricting-special-session-00713882" target="_blank"><u>GOP-led Florida eye midcycle redistricting</u></a> later this year. Currently in Virginia, Democrats control six congressional seats and Republicans hold five. Virginia Democrats, had been forging ahead with their plans to unveil a proposed map by their self-imposed deadline of Jan. 31, with the goal of holding a special election to approve the maps in spring.</p> 
<p>Democrats strongly criticized Hurley’s ruling.</p> 
<p>“This is a clear attempt to confuse voters and block them from having a say,” said Kéren Charles Dongo, who is heading Virginians for Fair Elections, the Democrat-affiliated group that launched this month to urge the state's voters to pass a pending ballot measure. “We’re prepared for what comes next, and Virginians deserve both the right to vote and the chance to level the playing field.”</p> 
<p>Spokespeople for the top Democrats in the Virginia legislature, state Sen. Majority Leader Scott Surovell and state House Speaker Don Scott, did not respond to requests for comment on whether the ruling will impact the release of their proposed maps.</p> 
<p>But in a joint statement along with other top Virginia Democrats on Tuesday, the group struck a defiant tone and promised to continue with plans to redraw maps, suggesting the ruling was but a minor blip in their quest to deliver what could be a 10-1 map that favors their party.</p> 
<p>“Nothing that happened today will dissuade us from continuing to move forward and put this matter directly to the voters,” the Democratic lawmakers said. “We will be appealing this ruling immediately and we expect to prevail.”</p> 
<p>Julie Merz, who heads up the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, suggested the court overreached. </p> 
<p>"This rogue decision is a disappointing, but temporary setback issued by a lower court that will be immediately appealed — where we're confident it will be overturned," Merz said in a statement. "The order issued today has no constitutional basis, but is instead a desperate attempt to keep electoral power out of the hands of Virginia voters."<br></p>CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Kéren Charles Dongo's name.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famed American composer Philip Glass on Tuesday announced he is pulling the premiere of his newest symphony, titled “Lincoln,” from the Kennedy Center, becoming the latest performer to cut ties with the beleaguered institution since its takeover by President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>“Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,” Glass said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUBSBMejT_5/?igsh=MTM5NGVmcXh4YnYzZg==" target="_blank">in a post on social media</a>. “Therefore, I feel an obligation to withdraw this Symphony premiere from the Kennedy Center under its current leadership.”</p> 
<p>He joins a growing list of artists who have canceled performances at the Kennedy Center since Trump’s overhaul of Washington’s premier arts center. Grammy winner Renee Fleming canceled performances set for May, <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/nso/home/2025-2026/gaffigan/" target="_blank">the institution announced on its website</a>. More performers, including banjo player Béla Fleck and singer Sonia De Los Santos, as well as groups such as the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Seattle Children’s Theater, have also canceled planned shows.</p> 
<p>Trump has made rebranding the Kennedy Center a priority since returning to the White House early last year. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/donald-trump-kennedy-center-014498" target="_blank">axed several members from the center’s board</a> and installed himself as chair in February 2025, later bringing on longtime ally Richard <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-ric-grenell-kennedy-center-00203484" target="_blank">Grenell to serve as interim executive director</a>.</p> 
<p>In December, the newly reformed Kennedy Center’s board voted to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/trump-kennedy-center-00698140" target="_blank">add the president’s name</a> to the building. One lawmaker, Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), an ex officio member of the board, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/23/kennedy-center-lawsuit-trump-00704327" target="_blank">sued in protest</a>.</p> 
<p>Trump has also taken a personal interest in a refurbishment of the Center, including overseeing details <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115787817857959030" target="_blank">down to the theater’s armrests</a>.</p> 
<p>Glass, 88, is one of the country’s most celebrated living composers, <a href="https://www.eno.org/discover-opera/articles/the-beginners-guide-to-philip-glass/" target="_blank">an early pioneer of minimalism</a> in classical music and famous in part for scores in films such as 2002’s "The Hours" and "The Truman Show," starring Jim Carrey.</p> 
<p>“We have no place for politics in the arts, and those calling for boycotts based on politics are making the wrong decision," Roma Daravi, the institution's vice president of public relations, said in a statement. "We have not cancelled a single show. Leftist activists are pushing artists to cancel but the public wants artists to perform and create—not cancel under pressure from political insiders that benefit from creating division.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Democratic opposition research powerhouse is putting massive troves of its work product online ahead of the midterms. And it’s using artificial intelligence to help everyone from campaigns to podcasters figure out how to navigate it.</p> 
<p>The project from American Bridge 21st Century, shared first with POLITICO, reflects an expansion of its efforts ahead of the 2026 midterms — as well as the evolving nature of political campaigning, including oppo research, in an increasingly fragmented media environment.</p> 
<p>“Swing voters are generally speaking getting their information very ambiently,” American Bridge President Pat Dennis said in an interview. </p> 
<p>A challenge in recent election cycles, he said, has not been a lack of opposition research, but rather how to best convey it when more voters are getting political news from podcasts, social media influencers or group chats. “If people can’t find it or read it, it’s no good,” Dennis said.</p> 
<p>The new tool, <a href="https://research-books.com/" target="_blank">titled Research Books</a>, is a public-facing website featuring opposition research on dozens of Republican candidates in races that American Bridge has identified as crucial to deciding control of Congress. It also includes select statewide candidates.</p> 
<p>Pages for each candidate feature messaging around key votes, candidate-specific research and — in some races — videos from Democratic trackers and sample media based on the oppo that closely resemble campaign ads.</p> 
<p>It also includes an AI-powered search tool that aims to bring together different sources about a candidate into cohesive messaging. (The AI agent only probes the super PAC’s internal database, not external sources or the wider internet.) </p> 
<p>Results from the search link back to original sources, which include news articles, videos and public records. The tool also integrates with other external large language model platforms such as ChatGPT.</p> 
<p>The notion of publishing opposition research files online, rather than keeping them closely held by party operatives for strategic deployment, is not entirely new for American Bridge. Ahead of the 2020 election, the group <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/07/american-bridge-trump-oppo-book-392536" target="_blank">posted 1,043 pages of opposition research</a> about President Donald Trump online for use by other Democratic groups. </p> 
<p>Sharing such research publicly is a way for super PACs to avoid running afoul of campaign finance laws that prohibit direction coordination.</p> 
<p>Because the new research tool is publicly available online, it could similarly be used by Democratic campaigns or other outside groups — though American Bridge hopes the uptake is broader than that, including among influencers and voters.</p> 
<p>For its initial public rollout, Research Books includes 15 GOP House incumbents in seats Democrats are hoping to flip this year, along with Republican Senate candidates in four seats Democrats are trying to flip, as well as Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking reelection.</p> 
<p>The initial list also includes 15 candidates for governor or attorney general in key states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Hampshire and Iowa.</p> 
<p>The inclusion of attorney general candidates, newer territory for American Bridge, reflects in part the greater role that they have played in suing the Trump administration, Dennis said. He expects the tool to include more races and candidates as the midterms near, with the super PAC seeking to help Democrats cast a broad net.</p> 
<p>“There are times where opposition research can fundamentally reshape a race, so we prefer to take an expansive view on this,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>
