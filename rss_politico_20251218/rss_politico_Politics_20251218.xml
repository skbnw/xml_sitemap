      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The affordability crisis that upended global politics last year continues to ripple across some of the world’s biggest democracies — punishing incumbents and undermining longstanding political alliances.</p> 
<p>New <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-2e9e-d369-affb-6fbe91a20000" target="_blank">international POLITICO polling</a> shows the voter frustration with persistent financial strain remains a deeply potent force today. In five major economies, The POLITICO Poll found ongoing cost-of-living pressures continue to reverberate through politics:<br></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>In the <b>United States</b>, where Donald Trump returned to power on a campaign of economic populism, nearly two-thirds of voters — 65 percent — say the cost of living in the country has gotten worse over the last year.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>In the <b>United Kingdom</b>, where voters ousted the Conservative Party in 2024 after 14 years of rule, 77 percent say the cost of living has worsened.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>In <b>France</b>, where President Emmanuel Macron is grappling with <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-approval-rating-drops-historic-low/">historically low favorability ratings</a>, almost half of all adults — 45 percent — say their country is falling behind comparable economies.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>In <b>Germany</b>, after prolonged infighting over the economy, former Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s governing coalition collapsed last year. There, 78 percent of respondents say the cost of living has gotten worse over the last year.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>And in <b>Canada</b>, a post-pandemic affordability crisis helped fuel a public backlash against then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government ahead of his resignation earlier this year. The POLITICO Poll found that 60 percent of adults in the country say the cost of living is the worst they can remember it being.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The results, from POLITICO and Public First’s first-ever joint international poll, illustrate the uphill battle many leaders face in trying to contain the intertwined economic and political unrest. Five years after the coronavirus pandemic upended the global economy — and as the world contends with competing conflicts and AI rapidly becoming a defining force — meaningful shares of respondents across the U.S., Canada, and Europe’s biggest economies of Germany, the United Kingdom and France view the cost of living as among the biggest issues facing the world right now.</p><p>But as leaders seek to address the affordability concerns, many say that their leaders could be doing a lot more to help on the cost of living, but are choosing not to.<br></p><p>That has left incumbent governments grappling with how to manage the rising economic dread — and control the resulting political backlash. It has also created an opportunity for opposition parties on economic messaging.</p> 
<p>“For incumbents it’s very difficult to run on these platforms,” said Javier Carbonell, a policy analyst at the European Policy Centre. “Today, center-left and center-right parties are seen as incumbents, and as the ones who are to put the blame.”</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Voters are pessimistic about the cost of living</h4> 
<p>There is a pervasive sense in the five countries that their economies are deteriorating.</p> 
<p>In France, 82 percent of adults say the cost of living in the country has worsened over the last year, as do 78 percent of respondents in Germany; 77 percent of adults in the United Kingdom and 79 percent in Canada say the same.</p> 
<p>A majority of people in all five countries go even further, saying the cost of living crisis has never been worse.<br></p><p>In a further sign of the trouble facing leaders, the poll results suggest many view affordability as a systemic problem more than a personal one. Majorities across the countries, for example, say the issue of affordability is the high cost of goods, not that they are not paid too little.</p> 
<p>In the U.K., roughly two-thirds of adults say the country’s economy has deteriorated — greater than the 46 percent who say their own financial situation has worsened over the last year. That same pattern holds for France, Canada and Germany, suggesting the public holds broad concerns about the economy and affordability that go beyond their individual lives.</p> 
<p>While the European Union’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-economy-grows-more-than-expected-in-2025-despite-trumps-tariffs/" target="_blank">economy is set to grow</a> by 1.4 percent in 2025, the economy in Germany has weakened over the past two years, and is expected to stagnate this year. In France, a series of government policies aimed at addressing cost-of-living concerns have contributed to an exploding national debt, which currently stands at nearly $4 trillion USD.</p> 
<p>In the United Kingdom, the results come against a backdrop of sluggish economic growth, with incumbent Prime Minister Keir Starmer struggling to convince voters that his center-left Labour Party can drive down the cost of living.</p> 
<p>And in Canada, the country’s deep-seated anxiety is born out by federal inflation data. Statistics Canada <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/251215/dq251215a-eng.htm" target="_blank">reported this week</a> that the consumer price index ticked up 2.2 percent in November compared to the same month in 2024 — nearly a bullseye on the central bank's 2 percent target.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Negative economic views are shaping politics</h4> 
<p> Voters’ economic concerns are roiling politics.</p> 
<p>In 2024, Trump ran a campaign on economic concerns without having to oversee the economy himself. That dynamic has shifted in recent months, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747" target="_blank">with voters beginning to sour on his handling of the economy</a>, underscoring the difficulty of convincing voters of economic progress amid stubborn cost-of-living concerns.</p> 
<p>That feeling of falling behind was particularly acute among European respondents in the POLITICO Poll, with nearly half of adults in Germany, France and the United Kingdom saying that their country is “generally falling behind other comparable economies.”<br></p><p>That pessimism has pushed many people out of the political process, Carbonell said, “because there’s no expectation that things are going to change.” For others, it’s fueling a search for political alternatives.</p> 
<p>“There is this increasing demand for a very anti-system politics,” he said.</p> 
<p>In Germany, Chancellor Friedrich Merz made revamping the economy a central campaign promise. But since taking office, he has been preoccupied with geopolitical issues, including the ongoing trade war and the Russia-Ukraine war.</p> 
<p>That has become a successful line of attack for Merz's critics — among them the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, now polling in first place. The party has accused Merz — whose approval ratings are at an all-time low — of not paying enough attention to the needs of the people in his own country, nicknaming him the “foreign policy chancellor.”</p> 
<p>In France, the government is looking to roll back some of the policies it rolled out in response to cost-of-living concerns, but doing so could prove particularly unpopular with a population laser-focused on high costs. It could also fuel anti-establishment parties on the right and left, which have made the issue a central weapon against France’s crumbling political center.</p> 
<p>David Coletto, a longtime pollster in Canada and CEO of the firm Abacus Data, has for years tracked affordability concerns — and found widespread concern among most survey respondents.</p> 
<p>"This is not a marginal concern or a background anxiety," <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/for-67-of-canadians-the-cost-of-living-feels-as-bad-as-it-ever-has/" target="_blank">he wrote of results</a> from POLITICO’s November poll. "It is a dominant lived experience that continues to shape how Canadians interpret government performance, leadership, and competing policy priorities, alongside concern about Donald Trump, trade, and global instability."</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Affordability messaging will be a central message in upcoming elections</h4> 
<p>Affordability will be a central feature of elections across the globe next year — with some of that messaging already underway. In the U.S., Democratic candidates from New York to Georgia <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/affordability-affordability-affordability-democrats-new-winning-formula-00637023" target="_blank">focused much of their 2025</a> campaigns on lowering the costs of living, and both parties are planning to center the issue in the midterms.</p> 
<p>"For now, the cost of living remains a warning light rather than a red light for the Carney government," Coletto wrote. "But the intensity of feeling, combined with seasonal pressures and fragile household finances, means the issue is unlikely to fade quietly into the background."<br></p><p>Starmer’s government — languishing in the polls and facing local elections in 2026 — has pivoted in recent weeks to a more explicit focus on affordability.</p> 
<p>The U.K. government has also floated freezing train fares, lowering energy bills, and boosting the minimum wage in an attempt to solve the affordability crisis, but a record-high level of taxation confirmed at a government-wide budget last month risks blunting its economic message.</p> 
<p>In Germany, the issue of affordability may gain new momentum when voters in five federal states head to the polls to elect new state parliaments next year. In Berlin, the far-left Left Party, for example, plans to take a playbook from the affordability-centered campaign of New York's Zohran Mamdani as a model for the state elections in September.</p> 
<p>With local elections also taking place across France next year, and a presidential election in 2027, these issues are likely to continue to take center stage, especially in the larger cities where pricing pressures have been particularly acute.</p> 
<p>In Paris, the outgoing center-left administration has been praised for making the city greener and more pedestrian-friendly, but far more needs to be done on affordability, said David Belliard, a member of the outgoing administration and the Green Party’s candidate for mayor.</p> 
<p>“We’ve spent a lot of time fighting against the end of the world,” Belliard said, “but maybe not enough helping people make it to the end of the month.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio gubernatorial hopeful and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy urged conservatives to reject "Groyper transgressions," becoming the latest Republican to weigh in on the ongoing debate in the party over antisemitism.</p> 
<p>“If, like Mr. Fuentes, you believe that Hitler was “really f-ing cool,” or if you publicly call Usha Vance a “jeet,” then you have no place in the conservative movement, period,” Ramaswamy wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/opinion/republican-identity-divide.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share" target="_blank">in a New York Times op-ed published Wednesday</a>, referring to a derogatory ethnic slur against South Asians.</p> 
<p>In the quote, Ramaswamy was referencing Nick Fuentes and Vice President JD Vance’s wife Usha Vance, the daughter of Indian immigrant parents.</p> 
<p>Ramaswamy shared that he has been the target of racial slurs and attacks on social media, despite “older Republicans” doubting the rising prevalence white supremacy in right-leaning online circles.</p> 
<p>As the number of “Groypers,” or followers and fans of Fuentes, appears to grow, Ramaswmy said, there is a “real reluctance” from his fellow Republicans to condemn the “new identity politics on the right.”</p> 
<p>“It should be acceptable on the right to criticize U.S. aid to Israel or immigrant visas, but it is downright unacceptable to spew poison toward Jews, Indians or any other ethnic group,” said Ramaswamy, the son of Indian immigrants.</p> 
<p>The Republican Party has been embroiled in an intra-party struggle over whether the party should welcome groups associated with Fuentes, a debate that burst into the open after Tucker Carlson interviewed Fuentes on his podcast. Carlson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBB0D4tf1Y" target="_blank">during his friendly October interview with Fuentes</a>, said GOP backers of Israel have been “seized by this brain virus.” Fuentes said that “organized Jewry” is a major barrier to unifying America.</p> 
<p>While President Donald Trump defended Carlson’s decision to interview Fuentes, House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/mike-johnson-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview-00668135" target="_blank">called it a “big mistake.”</a> The president of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, also initially defended Carlson’s interview, arguing the real enemy was “the vile ideas of the left.” But after immense backlash — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/mcconnell-heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson-00631510" target="_blank">including from Sen. Mitch McConnell</a> (R-Ky.) and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/heritage-resigns-robert-george-tucker-00654143" target="_blank">multiple employees quitting</a> — Roberts walked back his comments and condemned Fuentes’ rhetoric.</p> 
<p>In his op-ed, Ramaswamy said that condemning the antisemitism brewing within a faction of the GOP does not need to equate to censorship but “moral clarity instead of indulgence.”</p> 
<p>“The point isn’t to clutch pearls, but to prevent the gradual legitimization of this un-American animus,” he said. “This online edgelording reminds me of toddlers testing their parents’ limits: The job of a real Republican leader is to set firm boundaries for young followers, as a good father does for a transgressive son.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans are making mail-in voting a core part of their midterm battle plans — a sharp contrast with President Donald Trump’s efforts to abolish the practice as they scramble to turn out his base.</p> 
<p>In Wisconsin, the state party is preparing a full-court press of mailers, emails, phone banks, door knocks and digital ads to get voters to sign up for mail ballots.</p> 
<p>In Michigan, the Monroe County GOP ran a social media campaign ahead of the fall election urging voters to utilize permanent absentee ballots and is planning an even bigger push next year.</p> 
<p>In Pennsylvania, where <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/18/trump-mail-voting-attacks-00513875" target="_blank">Republicans poured $16 million into boosting</a> the number of GOP voters using mail ballots in 2024, the state party chair called it “a priority” for 2026. The nonprofit Citizens Alliance, which aided efforts to get Republicans to return their mail ballots in Pennsylvania last year, is planning to knock 750,000 doors ahead of the midterms to encourage infrequent voters to embrace the practice.</p> 
<p>And the Republican National Committee intends to build on the aggressive early mail and in-person voting campaign it ran successfully in 2024, after shying away from the practice in 2020, while also supporting election security efforts including stopping ballots from being counted after Election Day, according to a person granted anonymity to describe the committee’s plans.</p> 
<p>“Democrats have built a pretty massive structural advantage in early voting for a long, long time. And we just can’t keep going into election night 100,000 votes down and expect to make it up in 12 hours,” Wisconsin GOP Chair Brian Schimming said in an interview. “Treating early voting as optional, or something Democrats do, is a losing gamble.”</p> 
<p>Trump has long falsely decried mail voting as rife with fraud. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-ban-mail-in-voting-before-2026-midterm-elections/" target="_blank"><u>Over the summer, he vowed</u></a> that Republicans “are going to do everything possible [to] get rid of mail-in ballots.” In November, and again this week, he called on Senate Republicans to eliminate the filibuster and pass a law to ban mail-in voting.</p> 
<p>But, as has been the case for several years, he and his party are out of sync.</p> 
<p>Rattled by electoral losses across the country this year and fearing a turnout slump in 2026 when control of Congress is on the line, Republican party chairs and operatives in battleground states Trump flipped by razor-thin margins in 2024 are turning to mail-in voting to keep lower-propensity voters engaged when he’s not on the ballot. They’re redoubling the 2024 efforts they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/06/trumps-early-voting-00182611" target="_blank"><u>ran successfully despite Trump alternating between promoting and railing against</u></a> the practice — a turnabout after his vilification of mail ballots contributed to GOP losses in 2020.</p> 
<p>Now, back in office, Trump is escalating his war against mail ballots. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/25/trump-signs-sweeping-executive-order-targeting-election-rules-00249891" target="_blank"><u>signed an executive order in March</u></a> that attempted to bar states from counting ballots that arrive after Election Day, along with other election-system overhauls. Judges have blocked most of the order, and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/supreme-court-mail-in-voting-case-00644388" target="_blank"><u>Supreme Court is set to decide</u></a> whether federal law prohibits states from counting late-arriving ballots postmarked by Election Day.</p> 
<p>Despite pledging to “lead a movement” to eliminate “corrupt” voting by mail ahead of the midterms, Trump has yet to issue another executive order on it. State courts have upheld vote-by-mail programs expanded during the pandemic. And presidents have little authority over state-run elections, whose rules are guided by federal and state law rather than presidential decree.</p> 
<p>State and local Republicans, seeing few paths to overturning mail voting programs, are forging ahead — swallowing their own misgivings about ballot security in an effort to cut into a Democratic advantage as early voting options turn Election Day into election season.</p> 
<p>Pressed about their mission appearing antithetical to Trump’s rhetoric, Republican operatives uniformly insisted they’re simply trying to play by the rules they’ve been given and that they support the president trying to change them — even if they’re unsure he’ll succeed.</p> 
<p>“In Michigan, that’s the law of the land unless we can find a U.S. constitutional override, which I doubt that’s going to happen,” said Jim Runestad, a state senator who chairs the Michigan Republican Party. So, he said, “we’ll be fully engaged in early and absentee voting — we have to be.”</p> 
<p>Still, the renewed dispute between Trump and his party over mail-in voting is the latest evidence of cracks forming in the ordinarily unified Republican Party. GOP lawmakers throughout the country, from New Hampshire to Indiana, have been rebuffing the president’s push for an aggressive redistricting effort to shore up his party’s chances of keeping its slim House advantage next year. Democrats need to net just three seats in order to seize control over the lower chamber. And several members of Trump’s base, namely departing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, bucked him on the yet-to-be-released Jeffrey Epstein files.</p> 
<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p> 
<p>Republicans have already shown some success in convincing their voters to embrace mail voting. In Pennsylvania — where now-Sen. Dave McCormick’s campaign, party committees and outside groups spent millions promoting the practice — GOP voters cast 32.4 percent of mail ballots in 2024, up from 23.7 percent four years earlier, helping Trump narrowly flip the state. Roughly one in five Republican voters who cast ballots in the state that year had not participated in any elections since 2020, suggesting the method worked for some low-propensity voters who the party has to work harder to turn out.</p> 
<p>Nationally, roughly three in 10 ballots in the 2024 general election were cast by mail, according to a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/2024_EAVS_Report_508.pdf" target="_blank"><u>U.S. Election Assistance Commission report</u></a> from June. That was down from 43 percent in 2020, at the pandemic’s peak, but higher than pre-Covid, according to the report.</p> 
<p>“We have to encourage people to embrace mail-in voting and early voting,” Pennsylvania GOP Chair Greg Rothman said in an interview. “That has to be a priority for us in 2026.”</p> 
<p>Rothman won’t be alone in that fight. Citizens Alliance, the nonprofit founded by Pennsylvania-based conservative activist Cliff Maloney that hired over 100 people to chase ballots across roughly 500,000 doors in 2024, is gearing up to knock 750,000 in 2026. The Republican State Leadership Committee, which helped fund mail-ballot programs in Pennsylvania last year, put more than $2 million behind turnout efforts in New Jersey and Virginia this year and said it’s <a href="https://rslc.gop/memo-rslc-launches-project-doorstrike-initiative-for-2025-2026-election-cycle/" target="_blank"><u>“doubling down” on the program in 2026</u></a>.</p> 
<p>“Without Trump on the ballot, the low-propensity problem is an epidemic” and “Republicans have to adapt or die,” Maloney said. “The blessing here is that there’s a solution — and the solution is to actually put dollars, cents, time and energy into the same tactics that the left uses to target low-propensity voters.”</p> 
<p>State and county parties in Wisconsin and Michigan are planning similarly aggressive efforts, though they, like other Republican officials interviewed for this story, declined to share details or put price tags on strategies still taking shape. In Michigan, where voters can sign up for a permanent mail ballot list, Monroe County GOP Chair Todd Gillman sees it as a way to get more people engaged in more under-the-radar local elections.</p> 
<p>But even as they try to make inroads with mail voting, Republicans in other states are <a href="https://www.statenews.org/2025-11-19/ohio-lawmakers-vote-to-eliminate-the-four-day-grace-period-for-mail-in-ballots" target="_blank"><u>attempting to follow Trump in restricting </u></a>the practice. Ohio’s GOP-controlled Legislature last month passed a bill that would invalidate nearly all ballots received after Election Day that were postmarked prior to the deadline. The state’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, is now <a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/ohio-bill-mike-dewine-mail-in-balloting-grace-period/69690435" target="_blank"><u>weighing whether to sign it</u></a>. Utah GOP Gov. Spencer Cox <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5323797/utah-mail-voting-law" target="_blank"><u>signed a similar bill</u></a> earlier this year. Republican-led Kansas Legislature <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/03/25/kansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-bill-to-limit-advance-voting/" target="_blank"><u>overrode Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto</u></a> of another bill eliminating the grace period<b>, </b>which is being challenged in court.</p> 
<p>And Republicans pushing mail-in voting remain somewhat hamstrung by their standard bearer’s scaremongering, which has sown a deep distrust among GOP voters that party officials and activists say they’re still working to reverse.</p> 
<p>Trump made baseless claims of mail-voting fraud the basis for his constellation of stolen-election conspiracy theories in 2020. He piled on in 2024, suggesting scores of Pennsylvania ballots were fraudulent and accusing postal workers of “purposefully” losing some mail ballots — even as his campaign, the RNC and GOP-aligned groups prioritized early voting initiatives. Last month, as Californians voted to approve mid-decade redistricting in response to a GOP-led redraw in Texas, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115492361756063244" target="_blank"><u>Trump threatened legal action</u></a> that never materialized over ballots cast by mail in a state that sends one to every voter.</p> 
<p>GOP operatives have a script for that, insisting to wary Republicans that they’ve made voting by mail more secure and informing them of the various options they have to ensure their ballots reach election offices, including hand delivery.</p> 
<p>“We don’t necessarily like early voting or absentee ballots,” Gillman said. “But those are the rules we have to play by.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former first lady Michelle Obama on Monday appeared to push back on President Donald Trump’s controversial remarks about the death of Hollywood couple Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner.</p> 
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGNKbXBfPg" target="_blank">an appearance on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”</a> Obama shared that she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, were supposed to see the Reiners on Sunday — the same day their bodies were discovered stabbed to death in their California home.</p> 
<p>While her husband early Monday shared that the two were “heartbroken” to learn of the Reiners’ deaths, Michelle Obama appeared to single out Trump’s statement, which attributed the couple's deaths to “Trump derangement syndrome” and the director's lack of support for the president.</p> 
<p>“Let me just say this, unlike some people: Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know,” she told Kimmel. “They’re not deranged or crazed. What they have always been are passionate people. In a time when there’s not a lot of courage going on, they were the kind of people who were ready to put their actions behind what they cared about. And they cared about their family. And they cared about this country.”</p> 
<p>Police are currently investigating the Reiners’ deaths as an “apparent homicide,” and authorities announced Monday that Reiner’s son, Nick Reiner, is in custody as a suspect. He has been booked on murder charges and is being held on $4 million bail.</p> 
<p>The son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner was a strong supporter of progressive causes, including LGTBQ+ rights and early childhood education, and often held fundraisers and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/15/democrats-rob-reiner-react-00690528" target="_blank">campaigned for Democratic issues</a>. He was also a frequent critic of Trump’s.</p> 
<p>In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115724141568860081" target="_blank">a Monday morning post to Truth Social</a>, Trump said Reiner was “a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”</p> 
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/15/trump-rob-reiner-death-00690682" target="_blank">sharp backlash</a> from Democrats and Republicans alike, Trump doubled down on his comments during a medal presentation Monday afternoon, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he wasn’t a fan of Reiner’s “at all.”</p> 
<p>“He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned,” Trump said.</p> 
<p>The White House declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK — Two months after prominent members of a national Young Republican organization were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146" target="_blank">exposed for their role in a hate-filled, private group chat</a>, the city-based chapter showed it’s willing to welcome almost anyone.</p> 
<p>Inside Cipriani Wall Street, a lavish event space in the financial district, amid the sea of tuxedos and ball gowns, was <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/what-white-separatist-expects-trump-administration" target="_blank">white nationalist leader</a> Jared Taylor. Across the room sat EmpathChan, an <a href="https://x.com/Emp4thchan/status/2000084514769711542?s=20" target="_blank">influencer</a> who went <a href="https://x.com/emp4thchan/status/1984405716115833112?s=46" target="_blank">viral</a> recently for wearing blackface on Halloween. And appearing on stage was Markus Frohnmaier, a far-right German politician, whose political party the club had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/03/young-republicans-chapter-plans-to-host-far-right-german-leader-after-i-love-hitler-chat-00671540#:~:text=In%20August%2C%20it%20published%20a%20statement%20calling%20for%20a%20%E2%80%9Cnew%20civic%20order%E2%80%9D%20in%20Germany%20and%20declaring%20%E2%80%9CAfD%20%C3%BCber%20alles%2C%E2%80%9D%20an%20adaptation%20of%20a%20phrase%20associated%20with%20the%20Nazi%20party." target="_blank">cheered with a German-language phrase popularized by the Nazis</a>. At least nineteen other members of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party joined him.</p> 
<p>Also spotted at the New York Young Republican Club gala: Vish Burra, a club member <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/matt-gaetz-producer-fired-at-oan-over-antisemitic-posts-exclusive/" target="_blank">who lost his job</a> at the conservative One America News Network last month for <a href="https://x.com/jasonahart/status/1989372206166720915?s=20" target="_blank">posting a video depicting Jews as cockroaches</a>.</p> 
<p>Just eight weeks after the city club’s statewide counterpart <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/17/new-york-state-young-republicans-is-done-for-now-after-racist-group-chat-00613576" target="_blank">was disbanded by the New York State GOP</a>, the city-based club showed on Saturday night how a Young Republican organization can throw a party. Its 113th annual gala came as local chapters are still reeling from the racist and antisemitic “I love Hitler” chat — and as the GOP faces a larger reckoning over whether anti-Jewish voices have space within the party.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/ba/58/5aa40fed496b8b961e4e2de3f7d4/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary1.jpg" alt="Amid the sea of tuxedos and ball gowns was white nationalist leader Jared Taylor." data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Paola Chapdelaine for Politico" data-title="Amid the sea of tuxedos and ball gowns was white nationalist leader Jared Taylor."/><img src="https://static.politico.com/7e/d1/eaf783d94d8ab77c77c1d954d8a5/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary2.jpg" alt="The gala took place at Cipriani Wall Street, a lavish event space in the financial district." data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Paola Chapdelaine for Politico" data-title="The gala took place at Cipriani Wall Street, a lavish event space in the financial district."/><img src="https://static.politico.com/ab/10/4d430c3f48dabd766ab880fef92b/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary3.jpg" alt="Markus Frohnmaier, a far-right German politician, was an honored guest and appeared on stage." data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Paola Chapdelaine for Politico" data-title="Markus Frohnmaier, a far-right German politician, was an honored guest and appeared on stage."/><p>On Saturday night, the festivities provided a glimpse of what the party’s youth wing looks like amid those conditions. Over the course of the gala, a club member <a href="https://x.com/TimmyFacciola_/status/2000073210453426189?s=20" target="_blank">struck an attendee in the face</a> outside on the sidewalk, President Donald Trump was endorsed for a third term and a protester wearing a Nazi armband and waving a swastika-laden banner popped up from his seat to shout, “I guess we're all Nazis!” in an attempt to disrupt the event, according to two attendees and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-2024-d5ec-abbb-f8b63cc70000" target="_blank">release</a> from Goofball, the group behind the protest.</p> 
<p>The sold-out Cipriani served its signature bellini cocktail to attendees upon arrival. Zoltán Mága, a Hungarian violinist whose last name sparked jokes among the GOP faithful, performed during the six-course dinner, which featured baked tagliolini with mushrooms, prime rib and potatoes.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Democratic state senators, assemblymembers and city council members were <a href="https://x.com/JasonBeeferman/status/1999994606776385726?s=20" target="_blank">outside protesting the event</a> at a demonstration hosted by the Manhattan Young Democrats.</p> 
<p>“The people that are in that room, they were calling folks like me watermelon people,” said Assemblymember Jordan Wright, who is Black, referencing a line from the chats exposed by POLITICO. “They were being racist, they were being homophobic, they were idolizing Hitler.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/13/a5/3183b7594502982aa5ea99cbe650/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary4.jpg" alt="Assemblymember Jordan Wright stands during a protest outside the event." data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Paola Chapdelaine for Politico" data-title="Assemblymember Jordan Wright stands during a protest outside the event."/><p>In October, POLITICO reported on a chat with a dozen Young Republicans who held leadership positions in chapters of the organization across the country. Since that initial report, at least seven people involved in the chats lost their jobs, including a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/17/lawmaker-resigns-after-involvement-in-racist-chat-00614823" target="_blank">Vermont state lawmaker who resigned</a>. Two members of the chat apologized for the chats but blamed the rival city group for them coming to light</p> 
<p>Later in the evening, white nationalist Nick Fuentes — whose friendly October interview with Tucker Carlson has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/ben-shapiro-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview-00633323" target="_blank">splintered the GOP</a> — lingered on the sidewalk outside Cipriani after the club’s organizers <a href="https://x.com/TimcastNews/status/2000189193851461721?s=20" target="_blank">banned him</a> from entering.</p> 
<p>“This is the worst event they’ve ever thrown,” the club’s press chairman, Lucian Wintrich, told reporters huddled together in the “press pen” where the media was restricted for much of the event. Wintrich had been expressing frustration that the dozens of outlets he welcomed to the gala were relegated to a distant corner by his fellow organizers.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/19/3d/326612b44d988de0f5792775fdce/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary5.png" alt="Left: Guests sit for dinner during the gala.

Right: Political activist Jack Posobiec, left, holds a rosary before delivering the keynote speech."/><p>Conspicuously absent from Saturday night’s event were five GOP elected officials — including one congressman — who the club had announced would be there.</p> 
<p>Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) was advertised as scheduled to attend in an October email, but he didn’t show up. His team did not respond to requests for comment.</p> 
<p>Neither did New York City GOP Council Member Inna Vernikov — who was <a href="https://youtu.be/1Qvjt5_apPc?si=mQudYIpMHF1CW9ZX&amp;t=8337" target="_blank">brought on stage by Trump</a> at the 2023 gala while she wore an <a href="https://x.com/InnaVernikov/status/1733678493215453664?s=20" target="_blank">Israeli-flag-themed gown</a>. The local MAGA firebrand and longtime ally of the club skipped its event despite being promoted as an “honored guest” days before. Assemblymember Michael Tannousis and City Council Members David Carr and Frank Morano were also not seen<b>, </b>despite <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-1f92-d7be-a79b-bff752cf0000" target="_blank">promotions</a> touting their participation.</p> 
<p>Vernikov and Tannousis declined to comment. Carr and Morano did not respond to requests for comment.</p> 
<p>From the stage, the speakers took an increasingly anti-immigrant bent.</p> 
<p>“If dubiously elected or rather naturalized illegal immigrants are polluting our politics, the new right must have courage to deport them,” said Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), in reference to his call to deport Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, which he said would “resurrect our nation.”</p> 
<p>Earlier in the night, the club’s president, Stefano Forte, addressed attendees.</p> 
<p>“We all know who the enemy is,” Forte said. “The enemy is who shot President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The enemy is who almost shot him again two weeks [later] in Mar-a-Lago…The enemy slanders us in the media, throws wide open our borders, replaces our native population.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/59/d0/b238485645fca596c3a340aaaec8/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary6.jpg" alt="New York Young Republican Club President Stefano Forte delivered remarks during the gala." data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Paola Chapdelaine for Politico" data-title="New York Young Republican Club President Stefano Forte delivered remarks during the gala."/><p>On Sunday, in the wake of the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/12-dead-australia-bondi-beach-shooting-gunman-jewish-hannukah-celebration-terrorism/" target="_blank">mass shooting at a Hanukkah celebration in Australia</a>, Vernikov had a blistering message for her fellow Republicans that seemed to reference her absence.</p> 
<p>“For years, antisemitic rhetoric has dominated THE LEFT and has fully infiltrated the Democratic Party,” she <a href="https://x.com/InnaVernikov/status/2000333456304205842?s=20" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, saying such rhetoric led to the terror seen in Sydney. “Unfortunately, today the same venom has entered corners of the conservative movement and the hard RIGHT WING of the Republican Party. Lunatics like Nick Fuentes, Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, who spew bigoted, racist and antisemitic rhetoric, should be condemned and excommunicated from the Republican Party never to be welcomed again … I will DISASSOCIATE myself from any event, individual, or organization whether Democrat or Republican, that welcomes these vile bigots into their mist, defends them or amplifies their voices.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/72/1a/8692c1f34ea2a1f55f13a712199f/main-beefman-younggopgala-secondary7.jpg" alt="A band plays inside Cipriani Wall Street." data-portal-copyright="" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Paola Chapdelaine for Politico" data-title="A band plays inside Cipriani Wall Street."/><p>The club had a very different message about the attacks — one which was deleted from social media after POLITICO started asking questions about it.</p> 
<p>“The horrific terror attack in Australia last night is more evidence that Remigration is the only path forward for Western countries,” the club wrote in the <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-2023-d983-affb-e5fb6f8b0000" target="_blank">since-deleted</a> post. “America, Germany, Australia, and the rest of Europe must implement Remigration or more shootings like this will be inevitable.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats are mourning the death of actor and director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner after they were found dead in their California home on Sunday. The Hollywood star was known not only for classic films like “The Princess Bride” and “When Harry Met Sally,” but for his outspoken support of progressive causes.</p> 
<p>Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were “heartbroken” by the news. Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Reiner “fought for America’s democracy.” And former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called him “remarkable and excellent” in everything he pursued.</p> 
<p>“Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” <a href="https://x.com/barackobama/status/2000442913885712602?s=46" target="_blank">Obama said in a statement</a>. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”</p> 
<p>Reiner and Singer Reiner’s bodies were discovered in their Los Angeles home on Sunday after the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3:30 p.m., <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/14/2-people-found-dead-in-home-owned-by-rob-reiner-ap-source-says-00690378" target="_blank">according to The Associated Press</a>.</p> 
<p>Authorities are investigating their deaths as an “apparent homicide,” said Capt. Mike Bland of the Los Angeles Police Department. Authorities announced on Monday that Reiner's son, Nick Reiner, is in custody as a suspect in the case. He has been booked for murder and is being held on $4 million bail.</p> 
<p>Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer <a href="https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/2000564623326495130?s=20" target="_blank">called the news</a> of the Reiners’ death “horrific.”</p> 
<p>“Not only was Rob an incredibly talented actor &amp; director, he was also a relentless defender of democracy and the values so many of us share,” Schumer said. “He will be missed dearly. My prayers this morning are with the Reiner family and all those who loved his movies and what he and Michele stood for.”</p> 
<p>In her own statement, <a href="https://x.com/speakerpelosi/status/2000423280579064242?s=46" target="_blank">Pelosi reflected on Reiner’s contributions</a> to Democratic causes.</p> 
<p>“Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities — whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,” said Pelosi, referring to the California Children and Families Commission, which supports programs for children under 5 years old. Proposition 8 was California’s 2008 ballot proposal to ban same-sex marriage.</p> 
<p>Pelosi continued, “Civically, he was a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists. And professionally, he was an iconic figure in film who made us laugh, cry and think with the movies he created.”</p> 
<p>The son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner was a strong supporter of LGTBQ+ rights and early childhood education. Reiner often held fundraisers and campaigned for Democratic issues. In 2008, he co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In 1998, as chair of the campaign for the state’s Proposition 10, which led to the creation of the First 5 initiative, Reiner advocated for funding early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products.</p> 
<p>He was also a sharp critic of President Donald Trump, previously <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/422509-rob-reiner-calls-trump-mentally-unstable-he-is-aiding-and/" target="_blank">accusing the president</a> of “treason” and being “<a href="https://variety.com/video/rob-reiner-trump-mentally-unfit/" target="_blank">mentally unfit</a>” to serve in office. In an October interview with MSNBC, now MS NOW, Reiner compared the current political climate under the Trump administration as “beyond McCarthy era-esque.”</p> 
<p>“Make no mistake: We have a year before this country becomes a full-on autocracy and democracy completely leaves us," <a href="https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-rob-reiner-jessica-chastain-delay-savant-apple-rcna235963" target="_blank">Reiner said</a> at the time. “I believe the way to stop it is to educate people who may not understand what democracy is. They may not know what the impact of losing it is. We have to explain it, us storytellers have to explain to them what they’re going to wind up with if an autocrat has his way."</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/kamalaharris/status/2000442127856103609?s=46" target="_blank">Harris on Monday said</a> she was “devastated” to hear of Reiner and his wife’s deaths.</p> 
<p>“Rob Reiner's work has impacted generations of Americans,” she said. “The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture. Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.”</p> 
<p>California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom praised Reiner — <a href="https://x.com/cagovernor/status/2000433680645537978?s=46" target="_blank">who he called a “big-hearted genius”</a> — for his empathy.</p> 
<p>“His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others — and encouraging us to dream bigger,” said Newsom in a statement. “That empathy extended well beyond his films. Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights — from taking on Big Tobacco, fighting for marriage equality, to serving as a powerful voice in early education. He made California a better place through his good works.”</p> 
<p>Newsom added that Reiner will be remembered for his “extraordinary contribution to humanity.”</p> 
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the Reiners’ deaths a “devastating loss” for both the city and the nation.</p> 
<p>“Rob Reiner’s contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,” <a href="https://x.com/mayorofla/status/2000427445061669125?s=46" target="_blank">Bass said in a post on X</a>.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As President Donald Trump’s mid-decade gerrymandering push in Republican states <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting-vote-trump-00687714?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=b833d9b4-a3a9-4256-ac94-718892881680" target="_blank"><u>hit a roadblock in Indiana</u></a> last week, Democrats looking to make up ground in blue states got some unwelcome news: Fewer than one-third of Maryland residents view redrawing the state’s congressional lines as a “high” priority, per a survey out Monday.</p> 
<p>Just 27 percent polled by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, labeled redistricting a top issue, trailing far behind the cost of health care (77 percent), the quality of K-12 education (75 percent) and reducing crime (73 percent).</p> 
<p>The survey comes as lawmakers in the Old Line State grapple over whether to push forward an effort to redraw congressional lines to give Democrats a chance to flip the state’s lone Republican-held seat. Maryland lawmakers are slated to convene for a special legislative session on Tuesday, though they made clear <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/maryland-redistricting-state-legislature-00687992" target="_blank"><u>redistricting will not be on the agenda</u></a>.</p> 
<p>A similar push Trump championed in Indiana would have eliminated up to two Democratic-held seats; it was soundly rejected by that state’s Republican-led state Senate last week in a sharp rebuke of the president by members of his own party. Their opposition also relieved pressure mounting in some blue states, including Maryland, for state lawmakers to forge ahead with their gerrymandering counteroffensive.</p> 
<p>For several months, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a likely 2028 Democratic presidential hopeful, has been urging lawmakers to consider redesigning the state’s maps, but<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/bill-ferguson-wes-moore-00664770" target="_blank"><u> has been stymied by state Senate President Bill Ferguson</u></a>, a fellow Democrat who thinks the move could jeopardize the strength of Maryland Democrats’ congressional dominance. Democrats control seven of the state’s eight congressional seats.</p> 
<p>“This is not a huge priority for Maryland voters,” Mileah Kromer, the director of the university's Institute of Politics, which conducted the survey, said. “Perhaps one of the reasons it hasn't really caught on as a major priority is because over the last year, Maryland voters continue to express concerns about the economic situation in the state.”</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, state lawmakers passed measures raising taxes and fees by $1.6 billion — and are bracing for lingering negative repercussions from the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.</p> 
<p>The survey of 801 Maryland adults, the majority of whom were registered voters, found 28 percent of respondents said the Maryland congressional lines were drawn fairly, compared to 41 percent who said they were drawn unfairly. Twenty-nine percent did not have an opinion.</p> 
<p>When broken down by party affiliation, responses show variance in opinion over how Maryland’s maps are currently drawn and whether mid-decade redistricting should be taken up by the state legislature ahead of the 2026 midterms, with control of Congress at stake.</p> 
<p>Among Democrats, 37 percent said the state’s congressional maps are drawn fairly. And among the majority who believe otherwise, 18 percent said the lines favor Democrats and 10 percent said they favor Republicans.</p> 
<p>Just 17 percent of Republicans surveyed said Maryland’s congressional lines are drawn fairly. Among those who view the state’s maps as unfair, 63 percent said the lines favor Democrats, while just 3 percent contend they favor Republicans.</p> 
<p>While high numbers of both parties said they were paying at least some attention to the redistricting debate — 61 percent of Democrats; 71 percent of Republicans — their views of what to do about it also broke along party lines.</p> 
<p>Maryland Democrats’ views of mid-cycle redistricting showed that nearly an equal percentage said they don’t like it and it should not be done — 25 percent — compared to 28 percent who said they don’t like it but believe it is necessary. Just 6 percent of Democrats support it but think it’s the wrong thing to do, compared to 32 percent who said they like it and mid-decade redistricting should be done.</p> 
<p>Among Republicans, 67 percent said they don’t like it and mid-decade redistricting should not be done compared to 9 percent who consider it necessary. Fewer than 10 percent of Maryland Republicans said they like it, but it’s the wrong thing to do or that they like it and lawmakers should move forward with it.</p> 
<p>The poll was funded by the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences at the university. It was conducted between Dec. 2 and 6 and has a 3.5 percent margin of error.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Democratic Party leaders gathered in Los Angeles for their annual winter meetings this week, for the first time in a long time the mood was warm.</p> 
<p>Optimism coursed through the hotel ballrooms, following a string of double-digit wins in off-year elections last month. Democratic National Committee members <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/newsoms-troll-energy-takes-over-the-dnc-00688472" target="_blank"><u>flocked to California Gov. Gavin Newsom — a likely presidential contender — for selfies</u></a> and major donors are resurfacing after a period of hibernation. Conan O’Brien, Jane Fonda and Shonda Rhimes joined Illinois Governor JB Pritzker for a major donor gathering, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. And Nebraska and Utah officials are among those expressing interest in hosting the party's novel midterm mini-convention next year, according to three people briefed on the conversations.</p> 
<p>“The party, broadly, is just feeling like they got their sea legs back,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles. “And they’re winning and winning solves a lot of problems.”</p> 
<p>DNC Chair Ken Martin nodded to the vibe shift in his own remarks Friday: "I can tell you, it's a much different feel in this room than a few months ago,” he said.</p> 
<p>But for all the energy at the DNC’s winter meeting, Democrats are still confronting challenges. The committee’s finances are shaky at best, badly trailing their Republican counterparts. The committee has yet to release its 2024 autopsy in full, as Democrats continue to argue over why the party lost so resoundingly last year. A proxy battle looms over the presidential primary calendar, as several states continue to lobby DNC members on the sidelines of this week’s meetings.</p> 
<p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris was warmly received when she addressed the convention Friday night, but her return to the national stage, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/kamala-harris-new-book-befuddles-dems-00574304" target="_blank"><u>fresh off a controversial book release</u></a>, is also a reminder of the party’s fractured response to its sweeping losses in 2024, when Donald Trump defeated her in every swing state on his way to becoming president.</p> 
<p>On Friday, Harris <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/kamala-harris-dnc-american-dream-00689951?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">gave DNC members a reality check</a> by delivering her most expansive diagnosis yet of what she sees as the country's broken political system. “We must be honest that for so many, the American dream has become more of a myth than reality,” she said.</p> 
<p>Most pressingly, the DNC faces serious financial problems. In October, it <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/20/dnc-loan-elections-fundraising-00663982" target="_blank"><u>took out a $15 million loan</u></a>, framed by the party as a financing investment into the New Jersey and Virginia elections that Democrats ended up dominating. While not unprecedented, it was a larger sum of money earlier in the cycle than is typical. The committee's loan also brings the Republicans' cash advantage into sharp relief — the Republican National Committee has $88 million more in the bank when accounting for the debt, according to November’s Federal Elections Commission filings.</p> 
<p>And some party members still want answers from the committee’s self-diagnosis for what went wrong in 2024.</p> 
<p>The DNC still hasn’t released its long promised post-election report, after earlier saying it wouldn’t come before last November’s elections. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/dnc-briefs-top-democrats-on-audit-of-2024-white-house-loss-00597998" target="_blank"><u>They have so far only shared initial findings with top Democrats at the committee’s national finance meeting</u></a> in October. The preliminary findings, which a DNC aide insisted at the time were incomplete, criticized Democrats for not investing resources early enough, while ignoring discussion of former President Joe Biden’s age. But some DNC members are looking for more answers.</p> 
<p>“It’s very hard for an organization to self criticize, so you need to keep the pressure up to make them do it,” said Eric Croft, the chair of the Alaska Democratic Party. “They said they’d do it. We’re going to make sure that they do.”</p> 
<p>But things of late are looking much rosier. Democrats are cheered by their double-digit victories in New Jersey and Virginia governor’s races last month, as well as a slew of other off-year and special elections in which their candidates outperformed their 2024 margins. They <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/06/mississippi-democrats-appear-to-break-republican-supermajority-in-state-senate-00639455" target="_blank">even denied the GOP</a> its supermajority in the Mississippi state senate. Public polling suggests the wind is at their backs in the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>DNC members estimated the electoral momentum will help with fundraising.</p> 
<p>“People are ready to open their wallets up now that they’ve realized what they’ve voted for,” said Manny Crespin, Jr., a committee member from New Mexico. “Now that they’ve realized it’s actually affecting their pocketbook, they’re going to do everything they can to reverse that.”</p> 
<p>One of the biggest decisions ahead for the DNC will play out in a little-known yet powerful panel, the Rules and Bylaws Committee, which is charged with setting the 2028 presidential primary calendar. States <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/27/democrats-move-forward-2028-calendar-00623836" target="_blank"><u>have until Jan. 16</u></a> to apply to be in the early window, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/25/dnc-2028-primary-states-iowa-new-hampshire-00521488" target="_blank"><u>the behind-the-scenes jockeying for a spot</u></a> has continued, several DNC members said privately.</p> 
<p>“All of the early states are trying to lay their groundwork to get the committee to back them,” said a Democratic operative who attended the DNC meeting. “There’s a bit of a proxy war brewing on this.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indiana Republicans’ redistricting rejection marks a rare ceasefire in the gerrymandering wars — and could lead to other state leaders backing off their own plans.</p> 
<p>The result gives cover for some Democratic-leaning states to stand down, even as the party’s base is frenzied over the issue. Lawmakers in Illinois and Maryland have for months had internal debates about whether to move forward with redrawing their maps. Indiana’s outcome relieved some of the mounting pressure they anticipated facing had Republicans in Indiana further gerrymandered their maps.</p> 
<p>Illinois Democrats have long said they would only gerrymander if the Indiana GOP bowed to Trump’s demands and redid their own map. In the wake of Hoosier Republicans’ move Thursday, their Democratic neighbors don’t seem eager to change their minds.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile in Maryland, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/bill-ferguson-wes-moore-00664770" target="_blank">one Democratic leader</a> is rebuffing entreaties from top Democrats to eliminate the state’s lone remaining GOP seat.</p> 
<p>Maryland Democratic Senate President Bill Ferguson has exchanged phone calls with Indiana Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray, four people familiar with the two leaders, granted anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly, told POLITICO. Each resisted pressure from top officials in their party to move on redistricting. Bray’s success could now lessen the pressure on Ferguson. Bray's spokesperson, Molly Swigart, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/maryland-redistricting-state-legislature-00687992" target="_blank">said no deal was ever made</a> between Bray and Ferguson on redistricting in their respective states.</p> 
<p>Officials in Virginia, where Democrats gained 13 seats in their House of Delegates in November’s statewide elections, are poised to make drastic changes to their congressional maps that could net the party upwards of four seats. But Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/spanberger-redistricting-00683066" target="_blank">sounded reluctant to the idea</a> of making wholesale changes to congressional lines at a POLITICO event earlier this week.</p> 
<p>There are headwinds elsewhere for Trump and his allies. In <a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2025-11-05/kansas-republicans-fail-to-get-support-for-redistricting-but-their-plan-isnt-dead-yet" target="_blank">Kansas</a> and Kentucky Republicans have so far failed to move forward with their redistricting pushes that are complicated by opposition from Democratic governors. Ohio Republicans struck a compromise with Democrats for a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/ohio-redistricting-gerrymander-new-map-00631254" target="_blank">less aggressive gerrymander</a> than what some national leaders wanted. And a judge picked a map in Utah that drew <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/29/democrats-seize-on-utah-in-redistricting-war-00535242" target="_blank">a safe Democratic seat</a>; and Republicans are facing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-redistricting-referendum-trump-gerrymandering-utah-14312a112b6e32d15e5ef36b83cdc6a7" target="_blank">a potential setback for Missouri</a>.</p> 
<p>That doesn’t mean the redistricting wars are over. Lawmakers in a number of other states are still weighing their own maps, with GOP-led Florida and Democratic-controlled Virginia remaining the biggest question marks on the board. Republicans are still eyeing Kentucky and Nebraska as well.</p> 
<p>“We’ve got a lot more states that we can do work on,” one person close to the White House, granted anonymity to speak candidly on a sensitive matter, told POLITICO on Friday, while admitting that “Indiana was definitely frustrating.”</p> 
<p>And if the U.S. Supreme Court issues a ruling <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-argument-00608340" target="_blank">further gutting the Voting Rights Act</a> in the coming months, a number of states are expected to rush to redraw their lines before their states’ filing deadlines, in a move that could give the GOP a huge boost and potentially put the House out of reach for Democrats.</p> 
<p>“The truth is, I think we're still, we're in the middle of this redistricting war,” said John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “We're all waiting to hear back from the Supreme Court as to what they're going to do and how they're going to move forward.”</p> 
<p>Here’s what to expect in the coming weeks from states including Maryland, Florida, Illinois and a challenge to the already-passed maps passed in Missouri.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Maryland</h5> 
<p>Perhaps lawmakers breathing the biggest sigh of relief from Indiana bucking Trump’s redistricting push are those in Maryland.</p> 
<p>Ferguson has for months been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/bill-ferguson-wes-moore-00664770" target="_blank">facing pressure from Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and national Democrats</a> to wade into the redistricting fight. That lobbying campaign to net Maryland Democrats an additional seat would have been kicked into hyperdrive if Indiana had drawn new maps.</p> 
<p>Reports of Ferguson <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/11/21/bill-ferguson-will-diminish-his-power-by-opposing-redistricting-analysts-say/" target="_blank">possibly losing his grip on leading the Senate Democrats</a> evaporated this week after he was <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/12/10/bill-ferguson-renominated-legislative-session/?fbclid=IwY2xjawOpOLBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFpNWo2dzNsRFZvdHByOHZrc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHsvb6X9YnayF_uyDbyjoRCJBqoW_IJKgjHv21HFlMyqvJv9EhuGdfgoGjihO_aem_8OB90-oRdUVSdT3KZ-WpJQ" target="_blank">unanimously renominated as Senate leader</a>. Then on Thursday, just hours before the Indiana Senate cast the vote dooming the redistricting effort, Ferguson put out a statement with Democratic House Delegates Speaker Pro Tem Dana Stein declaring that lawmakers in the special session Moore called for next week <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/maryland-redistricting-state-legislature-00687992" target="_blank">will definitively not take up any new maps</a>.</p> 
<p>While that likely closes the door on the redistricting push for this year, Moore still has an opportunity to reignite a pressure campaign aimed at Ferguson to hold a vote on the issue in January, when the legislature returns for regular session. The governor’s <a href="https://redistricting.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Redistricting Advisory Commission</a> is meeting Friday for its final public hearing to solicit comments from Maryland residents before its members make a recommendation to the governor and the General Assembly on whether to redraw maps.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Illinois</h5> 
<p>For months, Illinois Democrats have suggested they were unlikely to try to squeeze another seat out of their already-gerrymandered state unless Indiana Republicans redrew their seats.</p> 
<p>And while state Democratic leaders didn’t completely rule out redistricting in the wake of the Indiana GOP’s vote, they don’t sound particularly eager for a new map.</p> 
<p>“Our neighbors in Indiana have stood up to Trump’s threats and political pressure, instead choosing to do what’s right for their constituents and our democracy,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement after the result, without saying what Illinois might do.</p> 
<p>A person in Pritzker’s office, granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly, said the governor was less than equivocal in his statement because no one knows what Trump's next move might be.</p> 
<p>State House and Senate Democratic leaders struck similar tones, praising their Hoosier neighbors while pledging to stay vigilant against similar efforts in other states.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Virginia</h5> 
<p>Democrats’ best remaining chance for a multi-seat gerrymander is Old Dominion. But while statehouse leaders seem eager to push forward with a complicated plan for a voter referendum to approve a new gerrymander — much like California’s move — the state’s incoming Democratic governor doesn’t seem quite as eager to lend a hand.</p> 
<p>The Democratic-dominated Virginia legislature is expected to easily pass a procedural measure before putting the issue of redistricting before voters to approve a constitutional Virginia amendment to redraw the state’s maps ahead of the midterms — a move that legislative leaders have teased could lead to a 10-1 map.</p> 
<p>“I feel comfortable that we have an opportunity to do a number of maps here in Virginia to allow for us to level the playing field,” Virginia House Speaker Don Scott <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/virginia-house-speaker-optimism-supreme-court-00684139" target="_blank">said at a POLITICO event this week</a>.</p> 
<p>But at the same event, Spanberger hedged when asked if she supported redrawing maps to achieve the feat.</p> 
<p>“The calendar is tight, and for me, I want to win,” Spanberger said, pointing to Virginia’s first and second congressional districts that are currently held by Republicans. “I want to flip seats in the House of Representatives, and I know that we can because I just won those districts.”</p> 
<p>But when asked directly if redistricting is the way to go, Spanberger said that Virginia should “leave open the option” of new maps but that ultimately voters will decide if the legislature should move forward.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Florida</h5> 
<p>Florida Republicans could deliver their party three to five more seats if they press ahead with mid-decade redistricting. But two factors complicate that effort.</p> 
<p>First, GOP leaders aren’t on the same page. GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/24/desantis-floats-mid-decade-redistricting-for-florida-congressional-seats-00474675" target="_blank">been touting the need to draw new maps since last summer</a>, has suggested waiting until the spring of next year in case the U.S. Supreme Court weakens the Voting Rights Act and bars the consideration of race when drawing lines, a position backed by the state’s GOP Senate president, Ben Albritton.</p> 
<p>But state GOP House Speaker Daniel Perez said this week it is “irresponsible” to wait and that the House is prepared to send a map to the Senate during its regular session that starts next month.</p> 
<p>Second, GOP leaders may be constrained by Florida’s voter-approved constitutional ban on redistricting for partisan gain. Democrats have already asserted that drawing up any new map is “illegal’ and would violate these standards signaling that litigation is likely if state legislators pass a new map. But Florida's conservative-dominated state Supreme Court already ruled in 2022 that legislators can sidestep minority protections when it allowed a previous GOP-drawn map that was muscled into law by DeSantis, weakening its impact. </p> 
<p>Perez <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/florida-gop-house-speaker-insists-white-house-is-not-pushing-redistricting-00684542" target="_blank">insisted that he has not been under pressure from Trump or the White House to move ahead</a> on redistricting. When asked Friday if there was added pressure on the House to act due to the outcome in Indiana he said: “No sir.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Missouri</h5> 
<p>Missouri Republicans already passed a map to flip Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51324" data-person-id="51324">Emanuel Cleaver</a>’s (D-Mo.) district red, but Democrats are hoping to undo the GOP-passed map in Missouri via ballot measure. Earlier this week, they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/missouri-gerrymandering-midterm-elections-00683693?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nrid=e43f4a81-fe4f-4770-8d77-d9774bf5ba97" target="_blank">submitted more than double</a> the 107,000 signatures required to force a statewide vote for the secretary of state.</p> 
<p>If the signatures are validated, the map may not cannot go into effect in time for the midterms, and if voters approve the ballot measure, the map gets tossed. Republicans still have a bit of time, since GOP Secretary of State Denny Hoskins doesn’t have to approve the signatures until July. Plus, it’s unclear when the Republican-controlled Legislature will actually put those signatures up for a vote.</p> 
<p>The timing is causing a bit of chaos. Since candidates need to file by the end of March, prospective members of Congress may have to file in districts that aren’t set for the midterms.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans’ failure to get on the same page on expiring Obamacare subsidies is creating significant rifts between GOP primary contenders and causing heartburn for some of the party’s most vulnerable incumbents heading into November’s midterms.</p> 
<p>With just weeks left before Covid-era <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/obamacare-congress-negotiations-health-care-00688191" target="_blank">subsidies lapse</a>, causing steep health insurance rate spikes for millions of people, Republicans are all over the spectrum about what to do — with many of the party’s top candidates ducking when asked about the thorny issue.</p> 
<p>In Michigan, the subsidies have emerged as an early policy difference between President Donald Trump-backed Senate candidate Mike Rogers and his new challenger, former state GOP co-chair Bernadette Smith. Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66858" data-person-id="66858">Bill Cassidy</a>’s (R-La.) <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank">proposal to replace the subsidies</a> with federally funded health savings accounts is facing pushback from his primary opponents. In Georgia, a state with an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/24/georgia-republicans-trump-health-care-midterms-00666216" target="_blank"><u>especially high reliance on the Affordable Care Act</u></a>, all three Republicans vying to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff refused to commit to any specific health care proposal when asked previously by POLITICO, but <a href="https://x.com/bluestein/status/1998755153458114608" target="_blank"><u>told the AJC </u></a>on Wednesday before POLITICO published its story that they oppose a subsidy extension.</p> 
<p>Out of the 24 candidates POLITICO surveyed across key GOP Senate primaries and general election battlegrounds, 10 did not respond to repeated requests for comment on their health care policy preferences, while others gave vague answers.</p> 
<p>But as some Republicans dodge, other lawmakers in tough races are practically begging their leadership to fix the issue, which Democrats are already making a key focus of the 2026 midterm elections.</p> 
<p>“I know my people back home care tremendously about this,” swing district Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.), who is leading an effort to go against his own party leaders and force a vote on the expiring credits, said in an interview. “I would assume that’s the case in every district in America.”</p> 
<p>There are already warning signs of political pitfalls for Republicans.</p> 
<p>Most Americans want Congress to extend the subsidies, polls from <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/poll-support-for-extending-the-expiring-enhanced-aca-tax-credits-remains-high-but-dips-among-republicans-and-maga-supporters-as-shutdown-continues-and-partisanship-takes-hold/" target="_blank">health policy think tank KFF</a> and <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/obamacare-premium-subsidies-congress-trump-polling-december-2025" target="_blank">Morning Consult</a> show. And they’re already feeling the strain: Fifty-two percent of respondents to The POLITICO Poll in November reported that their health insurance premiums have risen over the past two to three years — and they’re equally as worried about being able to afford an unexpected health care bill. Nearly half of respondents who said health care is difficult to afford blamed the Trump administration for those struggles.</p> 
<p>Health care is a flashpoint in the crowded primary Cassidy is facing back in Louisiana that was fueled in large part by his 2021 vote to impeach Trump. The former physician also chairs the Senate Health Committee and co-authored one of the GOP proposals to try to address the surging rates.</p> 
<p>“I want people to have coverage,” Cassidy said after the failed vote on his proposal. “I spent my medical career in a hospital for the underinsured and the poor and the uninsured. My life's work is: How do you get care to those who otherwise cannot afford it? I understand where people are. The Democratic plan does not.”</p> 
<p>His bill failed to advance Thursday afternoon — while giving his primary opponents new fodder for attacks.</p> 
<p>St. Tammany Parish Councilmember Kathy Seiden said before the vote that the senator’s proposed health savings accounts are “out of touch” and called for a “time-limited extension” of the subsidies, while Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta described Cassidy’s bill as a “step in the right direction” but said he wants the funding to be “supercharged.”</p> 
<p>Republicans more worried about the general election than primaries sound much different on this issue, however.</p> 
<p>Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51168" data-person-id="51168">Susan Collins</a> (R-Maine) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/221840" data-person-id="221840">Dan Sullivan</a> (R-Alaska), who are both facing potentially tough races, were among the four Republicans who crossed party lines to support <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank">Democrats’ three-year subsidy extension</a> Thursday in the Senate. It failed, alongside Cassidy’s plan.</p> 
<p>“My state’s hurting on this,” Sullivan said after both bills tanked.</p> 
<p>Republicans have struggled ever since Obamacare’s 2010 passage to craft a functional, politically palatable alternative, even as health insurance rates have surged under the program. Now, Covid-era subsidies are set to expire, and they’re struggling once again to respond.</p> 
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/09/congress/cbo-aca-subsidies-00339880" target="_blank">4 million fewer people</a> would have health insurance by 2034 if the subsidies lapse. And <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank">premium payments would increase</a> from an average of $888 this year to $1,904 next year if the subsidies expire, according to KFF.</p> 
<p>Republican candidates vary widely in their suggestions for a policy fix.</p> 
<p>In Michigan, where Republicans are looking to flip retiring Democratic Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66862" data-person-id="66862">Gary Peters</a>’ seat, Rogers said “we can’t just put another bandaid” on a “broken health care system” and called for a “new system that works.” Smith advocated for a two-year subsidy extension while also working toward a new health care model.</p> 
<p>In New Hampshire, where Republicans are chasing another retiring Democrat’s seat, former Sen. John E. Sununu called to modernize “outdated” regulations and give states more power over their Medicaid programs while ensuring lower-income people are “protected against price spikes.” His rival, former Sen. Scott Brown, said in a statement that “any meaningful solution is going to have to address the underlying cost drivers … and not just temporarily subsidize an unaffordable product.”</p> 
<p>In Georgia, where Republicans have their best shot to unseat a Democratic incumbent<b>, </b>two of the three leading GOP candidates — Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter — could soon vote on a specific proposal if a health plan hits the House floor. Derek Dooley, the former football coach backed by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, said in a statement, “We should be focused on transparency, incentivizing doctors to deliver high-quality care, real market competition, and lowering healthcare costs for hardworking Americans—while making sure we put patients first.”</p> 
<p>Democrats are yoking GOP candidates to the lapsing subsidies. Senate Democratic campaigns lambasted their GOP opponents for their votes Thursday, and Protect Our Care, a liberal health care advocacy group, signaled a deluge of attack ads to come.</p> 
<p>“I’m worried about my colleagues,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196450" data-person-id="196450">Jeff Van Drew</a>, a Republican who holds a safe red seat in blue New Jersey, said Wednesday at the Capitol. “Do I think this issue is worth a couple of points in an election? Yeah, I do.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a blow to national Democrats redistricting push, top Democrats in Maryland’s Legislature said Thursday redrawing the state’s congressional maps will not be on the agenda during a special legislative session set to begin next week.</p> 
<p>Maryland Sen. President Bill Ferguson and House of Delegates Speaker Pro Tem Dana Stein instead said state lawmakers will focus on other state matters.</p> 
<p>The announcement from Maryland state Democrats comes as President Donald Trump and Republicans are pushing for GOP-led states to redraw their maps to make them more favorable to the party ahead of the midterms. Ferguson and Stein issued their statement before Indiana Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting-vote-trump-00687714" target="_blank">rejected an effort Thursday afternoon to redraw maps</a> in the Hoosier state. </p> 
<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a likely 2028 Democratic presidential hopeful, on Tuesday <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/Lists/ExecutiveOrders/Attachments/98/EO%2001.01.2025.25%20Proclamation%20Convening%20the%20General%20Assembly%20of%20Maryland_Accessible.pdf" target="_blank">signed an executive order</a> calling for a special session on Dec. 16, for the lower chamber to elect a new leader following the surprise resignation of Adrienne Jones from the post.</p> 
<p>“The General Assembly may also consider other business to be resolved prior to the beginning of the 2026 legislative session,” he wrote, appearing to leave open the possibility the Maryland House could move forward on redistricting. </p> 
<p>Both Moore and Jones support Maryland lawmakers redrawing the state’s federal congressional maps to gain an additional congressional seat in a push to counteract Trump’s effort. </p> 
<p>Moore, along with other national Democrats including Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries, have for months pressured Ferguson to allow a vote on a measure that could deliver Democrats all eight of the state’s congressional seats. Ferguson, who has cited the possibility of the party losing congressional seats should new maps be challenged in court, has emerged as one of the biggest impediments to the pro-redistricting faction of his party.</p> 
<p>Those close to Moore, however, suggest the push for redistricting is not dead.</p> 
<p>On Friday, the Maryland governor’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/wes-moore-redistricting-commission-maryland-00634531" target="_blank">Redistricting Advisory Commission</a> will hold its final public hearing with residents to solicit recommendations to the governor and the General Assembly on whether to move forward with redistricting.</p> 
<p>The commission members are expected to meet next week to discuss the potential contours of a new map based on public testimony and written statements, according to a legislative aide granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations of the commission.</p> 
<p>“The [commission] will continue its work and make a recommendation to the governor and state legislature on the need for new maps,” a second aide confirmed to POLITICO, also granted anonymity to speak freely about next steps in the state’s redistricting effort.</p> 
<p>Moore and his allies could ultimately press the Maryland General Assembly to revisit redistricting when it returns for regular session in January, which would allow more time for negotiations with Ferguson.</p> 
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) the Judiciary Committee ranking member, inserted himself in the state’s redistricting fight last month after he penned a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/maryland-redistricting-raskin-hoyer-00645511" target="_blank">&nbsp;letter urging Maryland state lawmakers to continue fighting on the issue</a> and to ostensibly buck Ferguson.</p> 
<p>Raskin directly addressed Ferguson’s reluctance to move on redistricting in a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/204221/transcript-trump-erupts-gopers-quietly-defy-plot-rig-2026" target="_blank">podcast with The New Republic</a> released Thursday.</p> 
<p>“One of the reasons he invoked for it was that he said he had spoken to the Republican president of the Indiana Senate, who said he was going to stay out,” Raskin said. “Well, if he doesn’t stay out, that is going to redouble everybody’s determination to change Bill Ferguson’s mind.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indiana Republicans withstood immense pressure from President Donald Trump, ignoring anonymous threats on their lives as they defeated his plan to redraw the state’s congressional map and dealt him one of his most significant political setbacks since his return to the White House.</p> 
<p>The GOP-controlled state Senate on Thursday voted down 31 to 19 the map that would have gerrymandered two more safe red seats, imperiling the party’s chances at holding control of Congress next November.</p> 
<p>The failed vote is the culmination of a brass-knuckled, four-month pressure campaign from the White House on recalcitrant Indiana Republicans that included private meetings and public shaming from Trump, multiple visits to the Hoosier State from Vice President JD Vance, whip calls from Speaker Mike Johnson and veiled threats of withheld federal funds. The hesitant local lawmakers held out in spite <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/indiana-republican-trump-redistricting-swatted-00654098?experience_id=EXYF89KVT5UQ&amp;is_magic_link=true&amp;template_id=OTJIR2CRKUD6&amp;template_variant_id=OTVPVBAUA2YMK" target="_blank"><u>of pipe bomb threats, unsolicited pizza deliveries to their personal addresses and swattings</u></a> of their homes.</p> 
<p>"The forces that define (the) vitriolic political affairs in places outside of Indiana have been gradually and now very blatantly infiltrat(ing) the political affairs in Indiana," Indiana state Sen. Greg Goode, a Republican, said in his floor speech before voting against the measure. “Misinformation. Cruel social media posts over the top pressure from within the state house and outside, threats of primaries, threats of violence, acts of violence. Friends, we're better than this.” </p> 
<p>Speaking Thursday night from the Oval Office, Trump lambasted Bray, who oversaw the defeat of the remapping push.</p> 
<p>“Bray, whatever his name is,” Trump said, threatening to “certainly support anybody that wants to go against him,” and reasoning that he had “done a tremendous disservice.”</p> 
<p>“It’s funny ‘cause I won Indiana all three times by a landslide, and I wasn’t working on it very hard,” Trump said, despite his team’s well documented involvement in the matter.</p> 
<p>Top MAGA allies sounded far more concerned.</p> 
<p>“We have a huge problem,” said former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who simulcasted The War Room show live from a suburban Indianapolis hotel to boost support for redistricting. “People have to realize that we only have a couple opportunities. We’ve got a net five to 10 seats. If we don't get a net 10 pickup in the redistricting wars, it's going to be enormously hard, if not impossible, to hold the House.”</p> 
<p>Democrats need only net three House seats next year in order to seize control of Congress’ lower chamber, and their party already neutralized a five-seat advantage Texas Republicans gave themselves by similarly redrawing California’s congressional lines.</p> 
<p>Chris LaCivita, Trump’s 2024 campaign manager and adviser to Fair Maps Indiana, a dark money group that blitzed the state with ads in recent weeks, threatened retribution to Senate Republicans who voted against the bill. </p> 
<p>“You have a state full of MAGA Republicans run by Republican MAGA haters,” LaCivita said in a pre-vote interview, mentioning Bray, former Gov. Mitch Daniels and Vice President Mike Pence. “If you don’t defend a political movement from those that stand in the way — then it’s not a movement at all — a handful of politicians in Indiana will now know what standing in the way really means.” </p> 
<p>Indiana officials whispered for weeks about fears that rejecting redistricting could result in a loss of federal funding—a fear that Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, made explicit in an <a href="https://x.com/Heritage_Action/status/1999141506473509071?s=20" target="_blank"><u>X post Thursday</u></a>. “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state,” it read. “Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”</p> 
<p>Two senior White House officials told POLITICO that Trump’s team had not spoken with Heritage Action, and that Trump had not made such threats.</p> 
<p>Following the vote, Bray told reporters the state was not in danger. “I've had lots of conversations with folks in Washington, D.C.,” he said, when asked about those threats. “Indiana will continue to function.”</p> 
<p>The failed vote saves the seats of two sitting members, Democratic Reps. André Carson and Frank Mrvan, whose districts in deep blue Indianapolis and purplish Northwest Indiana had been carved up to become heavily Republican under the proposed map.</p> 
<p>Informed by reporters about Indiana Senate Republicans rejecting Trump’s redistricting push, Speaker Mike Johnson said that’s “disappointing to me, adding, “but I'm very, very bullish on the midterms.” </p> 
<p>Johnson reversed his stance on getting involved in redistricting by whipping votes with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/johnson-indiana-upcoming-redistricting-vote-00686049" target="_blank"><u>calls to Indiana lawmakers</u></a> in recent days. </p> 
<p>“I've got to deal with whatever matters are finally presented in each state, and we're going to win. We've got a better record to run on.” Johnson predicted earlier this week the map would pass.</p> 
<p>The monthlong debate about whether to redraw maps exposed deep fissures within the party between the MAGA base and the more traditionalist, pre-Trumpian wings of the party. It also gained more attention nationally in the wake of the death of Charlie Kirk, who threatened primaries for Hoosier Republican elected officials who opposed it in the final weeks of his life.</p> 
<p>Turning Point Action, the organization founded by Kirk, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/05/trump-allied-pacs-target-indiana-republicans-blocking-redistricting-push-00678520" target="_blank"><u>has promised to work with other Trump-aligned </u></a>super PACs to spend tens of millions of dollars to primary the resistant Republicans who voted no. But the group could only turn out a couple hundred protestors recently ahead of this week’s vote.</p> 
<p>Several states closely watched Indiana for signs of where the redistricting arms race would turn next, but none more so than neighboring Illinois. The state’s Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, praised Indiana lawmakers with a statement Thursday that read, “Our neighbors in Indiana have stood up to Trump's threats and political pressure, instead choosing to do what's right for their constituents and our democracy. Illinois will remain vigilant against his map rigging — our efforts to respond and stop his campaign are being heard.” </p> 
<p>Maryland members of Congress, speaking before Indiana’s vote, said their state was likely to press on regardless of Indiana’s outcome. State Senate President Bill Ferguson has opposed redistricting, but other state officials have vowed to push the issue, and the state's congressional delegation has largely been supportive too.</p> 
<p>“I’m for us doing redistricting,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). “No matter what.”</p> 
<p>“That's really up to the legislature and the governor, but I think that we cannot have one hand tied behind our back, and so all options are open in this,” said Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-Md.), who represents the swingiest Democratic controlled-district in the state.</p> 
<p>Despite its Democratic governing trifecta, Illinois faces logistical barriers to redistricting and some resistance from the state’s delegation, including hesitation to break up minority communities in order to make red districts bluer.</p> 
<p>“We're watching to see what Indiana does. But you know, at best, being one district that would shift, I think a lot of people are wondering, is it worth doing all of that given the chaos," said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.).</p> 
<p>Lawmakers in Maryland, in particular Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, were closely following developments in Indiana. Both Ferguson and Bray have been under pressure from top officials in their respective parties on redrawing their maps. </p> 
<p>Ferguson has stymied Democrats efforts in the state and nationally, bucking Gov. Wes Moore, a potential 2028 presidential hopeful, who has been leading the charge for new maps in the state. Moore this week announced <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/09/moore-calls-lawmakers-back-for-long-anticipated-special-session-next-week/" target="_blank"><u>a special session for Dec. 16</u></a>, though Ferguson on Thursday issued a statement reiterating that redistricting would not be taken up when state lawmakers convene in Annapolis next week. </p> 
<p>On Friday, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/wes-moore-redistricting-commission-maryland-00634531" target="_blank">Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission</a> that Moore established last month, will hold its final public hearing with residents to solicit recommendations to the governor and the General Assembly on whether to move forward with redistricting. Commission members are expected to meet next week to discuss the potential contours of a new map based on public testimony and written statements, according to a legislative aide granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations of the commission. </p> 
<p>The GOP now turns to Florida, where Republicans stand to make significant gains that are complicated by tension between Gov. Ron DeSantis and House Republican leaders, as well some of the nation’s strictest anti-gerrymandeering standards. </p> 
<p>DeSantis and the state Senate president want to delay action until later next year to await the outcome of a Louisiana gerrymandering case that’s before the U.S. Supreme Court. But House Speaker Daniel Perez is adamant that the Legislature take action during its upcoming session that starts in January.</p> 
<p>Perez told POLITICO this week that he was “not being pushed by outside forces” to consider redistricting and that he had not talked to the White House directly or indirectly. Instead he said Florida should act because of a state Supreme Court ruling last summer that upheld the state’s current congressional map.</p> 
<p>“We don’t have a map, we haven’t started to draw a map, but it doesn’t mean we can’t start to have the conversation,” Perez said.</p> 
<p>Some Republicans contend Florida could flip three to five seats to the GOP with a new map, but Democrats contend any map put forward now would violate the state’s constitutional ban on drawing new districts for partisan gain.</p> 
<p>Across the country, six states have new maps for the midterms. The biggest gains for both parties — five blue leaning seats in California and five red leaning seats Texas — are likely to cancel each other out. </p> 
<p>In Ohio, a bipartisan commission agreed to a map that could net the GOP two new House seats, and North Carolina and Missouri drew one red leaning seat each. And in Utah, a court ruling has given Democrats a solid blue seat in Salt Lake City. There are still ongoing legal challenges in a handful of those states. </p> 
<p>Taken together, Republicans are currently ahead by five seats. As the playing field continues to change, it remains unclear exactly which party will come out ahead before the midterms. Both parties expect the redraws to ultimately favor the GOP, but Democrats have so far avoided a worst-case scenario and expect to only be behind by a handful of seats. </p> 
<p>The Indiana vote, though, marks a significant defeat for the White House political operation. </p> 
<p>Trump and political adviser James Blair were whipping senators through the week.</p> 
<p>The debate over whether to redistrict showed cleavages between MAGA and a more traditional GOP that could be exposed again in 2028, when Trump is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. </p> 
<p>"The sort of old school, deeply entrenched political forces in Indiana are Never Trumpers led by Mitch Daniels,” said a Republican familiar with the president’s thinking and granted anonymity to be candid about the vote. “It's been kind of a brewing situation there."</p> 
<p>Daniels, who Trump derided on Truth Social as a “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115698333420423237" target="_blank"><u>Failed Senate Candidate</u></a>,” said the vote was an act of “principled courageous leadership.” Daniels, who was never a Senate candidate, decided not to run, but told POLITICO he “would have won.” He came out as an early <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/07/daniels-interview-00497577" target="_blank"><u>opponent of redistricting</u></a>, calling it “wrong.” </p> 
<p>He said the vote demonstrated “a strong conviction in our state, and in our state, character, commitment to fair play and rejection of being bullied.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Nida Allam is launching a primary challenge against Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.), she announced Thursday, joining a growing list of candidates vying to unseat House Democrats with a slate of progressive endorsements already in tow.</p> 
<p>The Durham County commissioner is the latest progressive to launch an insurgent campaign against a Democratic incumbent, reinforcing what she describes as renewed energy in fighting against “Trump’s authoritarianism.” Her entrance into the race comes with a slew of progressive support — including from Justice Democrats, David Hogg’s Leaders We Deserve and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — an early inundation of endorsements that quickly adds salience to the 31-year-old commissioner’s bid for office.</p> 
<p>“I’m not here to stay quiet while Washington fails us,” Allam said <a href="https://x.com/NidaAllam/status/1999115842370306288" target="_blank">in her campaign announcement</a> Thursday. “I’m here to fight for the people who built this district.”</p> 
<p>In launching her bid, Allam panned Foushee, 69, as a “silent” voice in Congress, asserting that constituents are looking for action that reaches beyond “strongly worded letters and Tweets.”</p> 
<p>In a statement Thursday, Foushee — who’s served two terms in Congress — said her commitment to her district “remains unchanged” in the face of the emerging primary challenge, pointing to her past wins in advancing progressive legislation in Congress.</p> 
<p>“Without listening to my constituents, I would not be able to properly reflect our community's needs in Congress, like fighting back against Trump's billionaire tax breaks, helping to uncover Elon Musk's illegal interference in government contracts, and voting against the National Defense Authorization Act,” she wrote in the statement.</p> 
<p>Other progressive organizations like the Working Families Party and the Sunrise Movement have already thrown support behind Allam, who they say has the resolve needed to buck the Trump administration — and veteran Democrats — in representing the working class in Congress.</p> 
<p>Allam’s entrance into the race for North Carolina’s 4th Congressional District — a blue, Durham-based district — marks the second candidate in just a matter of days to announce plans to oust a sitting Democrat from Congress, with backing from major progressive players.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, Brooklyn progressive Brad Lander announced he’d challenge Rep. Dan Goldman for his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/brad-lander-set-to-challenge-rep-dan-goldman-from-the-left-00682619" target="_blank">seat in a district</a> that New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani carried. His bid — which zeroed in on ramping up resistance against the Trump administration — quickly accrued support from the Democratic base’s left flank, including from the Working Families Party, Mamdani and Sanders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter what the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is doing in crowded primaries, one thing is certain: It's angering other Democrats.</p> 
<p>The organization did little to stop the brewing primary in Texas, a potentially expensive feud for a prized but elusive seat punctuated by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/crockett-announces-texas-senate-bid-00680505" target="_blank"><u>Jasmine Crockett’s entrance</u></a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/allred-drops-out-of-texas-senate-race-00680502" target="_blank"><u>Colin Allred’s departure</u></a> this week. And in Iowa, Democrats involved in another crowded primary said the committee is warning consultants to not work with the non-DSCC preferred candidate.</p> 
<p>The campaign arm’s divergent strategies in Texas and Iowa illustrate its ongoing challenges with controlling the party’s messy primaries — triggering backlash from some Democrats who are furious over its light touch in Texas and heavy-handedness elsewhere. Nearly a dozen Democratic strategists, many of whom were granted anonymity to give candid assessments, described the committee’s unenviable, yet weakened, position, as Democratic base voters remain frustrated with the party’s national leadership.</p> 
<p>“They have a ton of tools they could’ve used and they didn’t use them” in Texas, said one person who has been involved in the Texas Senate race. “They don’t have the political power they once had … but it’s evident how weak they are institutionally.”</p> 
<p>Democrats need to net four seats to retake the Senate next fall, and intraparty feuds — like those unfolding in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa and Texas — could hinder that goal.</p> 
<p>In Maine, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is closely aligned with the DSCC, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/janet-mills-enters-crowded-maine-senate-race-00597876" target="_blank"><u>heavily recruited</u></a> Gov. Janet Mills over oysterman Graham Platner, who has racked up a strong small-dollar following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/21/graham-platner-tattoo-nazi-00617686" target="_blank"><u>despite</u></a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/kfile-graham-platner-maine-senate-candidate-deleted-reddit-posts" target="_blank"><u>various</u></a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/16/maine-senate-candidate-promoted-violent-political-action-in-since-deleted-online-posts-00613037" target="_blank"><u>controversies</u></a>. In Michigan, Rep. Haley Stevens was invited to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/09/27/down-ballot-republicans-move-on-from-epstein-00583379" target="_blank"><u>meet donors at a DSCC event</u></a> in Napa this fall; her two primary opponents were not.</p> 
<p>“When the DSCC intervenes, that’s the wrong person putting their thumb on the scale,” said Mary Jo Riesberg, Iowa’s Lee County Democrats chair, who endorsed Iowa state Sen. Zach Wahls in the primary. “It really rubs Iowans the wrong way. We’ve had it happen here before … but it’s Iowans’ business.”</p> 
<p>The DSCC has a long history of meddling in primaries on behalf of its preferred candidate — a strategy deployed by both parties and affiliated campaign committees. But wading into primaries has become more complicated in recent years, as the organization no longer exclusively controls access to the cash necessary to build out statewide campaigns. Instead, candidates “can build their own profile” and deliver it “to a national audience, which means dollars and attention, so you don’t have to go through the DSCC anymore,” said a second person involved in the Texas Senate race.</p> 
<p>“It’s the rise of grassroots dollars,” the person said, “so the DSCC is weaker.”</p> 
<p>Challenges to Democrats’ midterm strategy are also coming from inside its own caucus.</p> 
<p>Nine senators, coordinating primarily through a texting chain and calling themselves “Fight Club,” are focused on the primaries for open seats in Minnesota, Michigan and Maine — often backing those who are not seen as Washington’s preferred candidates, according to two people directly familiar with the group’s thinking. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/us/politics/schumer-democrats-senate-fight-club.html" target="_blank"><u>first reported</u></a> on the group’s efforts.</p> 
<p>“Wading into any primary is challenging in this environment [because] both party’s primary voters live in an anti-establishment world,” said Morgan Jackson, a top adviser to former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who cleared his own primary field after he jumped into the Senate race in July. “I think what you’ve seen from the DSCC, from the [Democratic Governors Association], is a desire to put forward nominees who can win the general election, and that’s where they’re always grounded.”</p> 
<p>But what kind of Democrat is best poised to win a general election — especially in battleground or red-leaning territory — is still very much up for debate inside the party, leading to more heartburn over how the DSCC should operate. It’s also part of what’s fueling the rush of candidates joining primaries for Senate and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/22/democrats-2026-primary-chaos-00363827?utm_campaign=washington_am&amp;utm_content=100825&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=briefing" target="_blank"><u>House races across the country</u></a>. And after sweeping victories in November, when <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/06/democrats-senate-house-races-2025-wins-00639344" target="_blank"><u>Senate Democrats are casting their eye deep</u></a> into the Senate map, there’s even more interest in running for office.</p> 
<p>So far, the DSCC has not endorsed in any of these states. In a statement, DSCC spokeswoman Maeve Coyle said: “The DSCC has one goal: to win a Democratic Senate majority. We’ve created a path to do that this cycle by recruiting formidable candidates and expanding the map, building strong general election infrastructure, and disqualifying Republican opponents — those are the strategies that led Senate Democrats to overperform in the last four election cycles, and it’s how we will flip the majority in 2026.”</p> 
<p>In addition to North Carolina, Senate Democrats managed to avoid a messy battle in Ohio, where former Sen. Sherrod Brown — like Cooper — is running virtually unopposed for his respective nomination. Both states are key to the party’s comeback plan.</p> 
<p>It’s also not the first time the DSCC deployed these tactics. In 2019, Senate candidates in Colorado and Maine <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-03/democratic-committee-accused-of-trying-to-hinder-progressive-candidates" target="_blank"><u>complained that the DSCC prevented consultants and vendors</u></a> from working with them after being warned that they’d be blacklisted by the committee, which had backed opposing candidates. In 2016, it <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2016/04/dscc-to-spend-1-point-1-million-in-pennsylvania-069978" target="_blank"><u>spent $1 million to boost Katie McGinty</u></a> in her Pennsylvania Senate primary over then-Mayor of Braddock John Fetterman. McGinty won her primary, but lost to Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.).</p> 
<p>Now it’s warning consultants against working with Wahls and Nathan Sage, the executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, two people involved with the Iowa race said. The DSCC hasn’t weighed in on the race formally, but several Iowa Democrats said state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian and two-time gold medalist, is the committee’s preferred candidate.</p> 
<p>“There is a very strong frustration among the Democratic base with party and establishment leadership that you didn’t see in 2018 or 2020 at this level,” said a Democratic strategist working with Wahls’ campaign in Iowa. “There is a resistance to the Democratic establishment, not just the establishment now.”</p> 
<p>Other Democrats, however, defended the committee's moves. “These sound like complaints from people who have hurt feelings they didn’t get contracts and not people who actually care about winning races,” said a Democratic strategist working on multiple senate races.</p> 
<p>Heading into 2026, the DSCC faces more primaries than usual. In Texas, Crockett, a Democratic firebrand who frequently clashes with Trump, will face off against state Rep. James Talarico, who has built a national profile by lacing his criticisms of Trump with Bible verses and appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast. Democrats expect the fight to be expensive, as Crockett and Talarico, both known to go viral online, are prolific fundraisers.</p> 
<p>Crockett’s entrance into the race — including a launch video featuring Trump calling her a “low IQ person” — prompted eyerolls among moderate Democrats. Trump has won Texas by double digits three times and Crockett “has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-partisan figure,” said Simon Bazelon, an adviser to the center-left Welcome PAC organization.” Bazelon added she’ll have “a very tough hill to climb while trying to win statewide.”</p> 
<p>Of her critics, Crockett said this week, “I just want to be clear for all the haters in the back. Listen up real loud. We gonna get this thing done.”</p> 
<p>The “Fight Club” senators — and the candidates they’re endorsing so far — tend to be more progressive, but they put a premium on backing “real fighters who are throwing out the old playbook,” one of the two people familiar with their thinking said. It’s a style over status quo argument that’s led Democratic elected officials to more openly criticize their caucus’ leadership.</p> 
<p>In Minnesota, seven of those eight senators, including Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), endorsed Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan over Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) in the open seat to replace retiring Sen. Tina Smith. The primary in a blue-leaning state has pretty much flown under the radar in recent months, but it’s on track to become expensive and contentious.</p> 
<p>“[The senators] all really liked [Flanagan], they want her to be the nominee and they were pissed that the DSCC was putting its hand on the scale,” said one person familiar with the situation.</p> 
<p>Craig, for her part, has also picked up backing from several senators, including Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). And she’s raised $2.2 million for her campaign, according to October Federal Elections Commission filings — more than double the nearly $1 million Flanagan raised.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know who the DSCC prefers, but there is definitely a clear difference in this race,” Craig said in a statement. “I’ve won tough elections against Republicans, show up and do my job every day, and voted twice to impeach Donald Trump. There’s another Democrat in the race who has never had to run a competitive race by herself on a ballot and regularly skips the work she’s supposed to be doing now back home in Minnesota — and now wants a promotion.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted Indiana Senate Republicans would “do the right thing” Thursday when they convene to render a final decision on a state House-passed map that President Donald Trump demanded to give their party two pickup opportunities in Congress.</p> 
<p>It would be an improvement over their 7-2 seat advantage in the state’s current congressional map, and is being decided as part of a national redistricting arms race that Trump kicked off to influence next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>Johnson also acknowledged for the first time making individual phone calls to Indiana senators in recent days. The strategy, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/trump-indiana-senate-republicans-redistricting-00680141" target="_blank">first reported by POLITICO</a>, came on the heels of his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/27/mike-johnson-indiana-redistricting-00670570" target="_blank">larger post-Thanksgiving call</a> with state House Republicans.</p> 
<p>“Well, because they're in the final stages of that process,” Johnson told POLITICO Wednesday night, explaining why he made the calls. “And I was told that there was some Indiana state senators who would like to talk to me and ask questions about the national perspective on it. And I shared that with them and told them I was encouraging them. I want everybody to make the decision that, you know, comports with their conscience, that they feel good about.”</p> 
<p>The calls have represented a marked increase in Johnson’s involvement in the redistricting wars, which early on he sidestepped by saying states should decide whether to redraw the lines. But now he is racing to keep up with his counterpart, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has been closely involved in the process to redistrict states across the map.</p> 
<p>It’s also a marked difference from the White House, which has threatened and intimidated reluctant Republicans ahead of Indiana’s nail-biter vote.</p> 
<p>The vote Thursday in the Republican-controlled Senate is expected by both sides to be a close one, and it remains unclear how many of the chamber’s 40 GOP senators have shifted since they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/redistricting-indiana-resistance-00663698" target="_blank">stalemated at 19-19</a> last month on a determination that was a proxy for the gerrymandering fight. The map needs 26 votes to pass, and assuming all 10 Democrats oppose it, Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, long a proponent of mid-decade redistricting, can break a 25-25 tie.</p> 
<p>“I had some great conversations there,” Johnson said of the calls. “They have some, some great patriots serving the people in the state of Indiana. And I enjoyed that. I met and talked with a lot of the House members when they were in their phase of that. So I believe they'll do the right thing.”</p> 
<p>In November, Johnson also addressed a growing list of elected Indiana Republicans who have faced swattings — false reports of danger that bring an aggressive law enforcement response designed to intimidate the target — and pipe bomb threats.</p> 
<p>“I don't think you can put the blame on the president for any of that,” Johnson said of Trump, who has publicly blasted the state’s GOP holdouts and not made efforts to tamp down the threats.</p> 
<p>State senators have described Johnson as taking a lighter touch with Hoosier Republicans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans are struggling with affordability pressures that are squeezing everything from their everyday necessities to their biggest-ticket expenses.</p> 
<p>Nearly half of Americans said they find groceries, utility bills, health care, housing and transportation difficult to afford, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-0a15-d5ec-abbb-da97ce7a0000" target="_blank">according to The POLITICO Poll</a> conducted last month by Public First. The results paint a grim portrait of spending constraints: More than a quarter, 27 percent, said they have skipped a medical check-up because of costs within the last two years, and 23 percent said they have skipped a prescription dose for the same reason.</p> 
<p>The strain is also reshaping how Americans spend their free time. More than a third — 37 percent — said they could not afford to attend a professional sports event with their family or friends, and almost half — 46 percent — said they could not pay for a vacation that involves air travel.</p> 
<p>While President Donald Trump gave himself an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus” grade on the economy during an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693?amp;nname=playbook&amp;amp;nrid=00000168-ddbb-d450-a7e9-fdbfac350000&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000" target="_blank">exclusive interview</a> with POLITICO’s Dasha Burns, the poll results underscore that voters’ financial anxieties have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b4be0000&amp;nname=inside-congress&amp;nrid=0000015a-d271-ddbe-a55a-d6770a470000&amp;orgid=756&amp;uniquet=vjmpEOsQvIeM0oJsD61kEg&amp;utm_att1=" target="_blank">become deeply intertwined with their politics</a>, shaping how they evaluate the White House’s response to rising costs.<br></p><p>Trump insists that “prices are all coming down,” as he told Burns, but the results pose a challenge for Trump and the Republican Party ahead of the 2026 midterms, with even some of the president’s own voters showing signs that their patience with high costs is wearing thin.</p> 
<p>POLITICO reporters covering a variety of beats have spent the past few weeks poring over the poll results. We asked some of them to unpack the data for us and tell us what stood out most. Here’s what they said:</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">TARIFFS</h4> 
<p><b>The big observation: </b>Trump has struggled to persuade even parts of his base to accept the idea that tariffs will pay off over time. A minority — 36 percent — of Trump voters said tariffs are hurting the economy now but will benefit the U.S. over time.</p> 
<p>Even fewer said the strategy is already working: 22 percent of voters who cast their ballots for Trump in 2024 said tariffs are helping the U.S. economy both now and in the long term, according to the poll conducted in November.</p> 
<p><b>What really stood out:</b> Staunch supporters of the president were roughly twice as likely as other Republicans to believe tariffs are a net positive already, although large shares of both groups still said they view them as harmful. Even people who self-identify as MAGA Republicans were split on one of the president’s favorite tools: 27 percent of those MAGA voters said tariffs are boosting the economy both now and in the long term, while 21 percent of them said tariffs are damaging in both the short and long term.</p> 
<p><b>What now?</b> Tariffs represent more than an economic tool to the president, who argues the levies have helped him negotiate peace deals around the globe and nudged corporations to bring investment to American shores.</p> 
<p>Trump has frequently urged Americans to be patient with his tariff strategy, much of which could be cut down by the Supreme Court in the coming months, but it remains a delicate political issue when a lot of voters may be more concerned about their everyday expenses rather than a broader global calculus.</p> 
<p><i>– Ari Hawkins</i></p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">COLLEGE COSTS</h4> 
<p><b>The big observation:</b> The tuition is too damn high. Only a quarter of Americans think college is worth the money, regardless of party, The POLITICO Poll found. Overall, 62 percent of Americans said college isn’t worth it because it either costs too much or doesn’t provide enough benefits — a belief supported most by 18- to 24-year-olds and those aged 65 and up.</p> 
<p>The income gap between Americans with college degrees and those with high school degrees widened over the last two decades. And recent research from the U.S. Census Bureau found the median income of households headed by someone with a bachelor’s degree or higher last year was more than double the median income of those with householders with a high school degree but no college.</p> 
<p><b>What really stood out:</b> Despite that economic divide, more than half of people surveyed who graduated from college supported the idea that higher education is either too expensive or not sufficiently useful.</p> 
<p><b>What now?</b> Both former President Joe Biden and Trump have tried to respond to this frustration, pitching efforts to boost technical education programs and federal support for professional degrees in lieu of 4-year universities.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has pressed universities to control their costs — attempting to tie those efforts to the schools’ access to federal funds — but also shed the student loan forgiveness programs Biden championed.</p> 
<p><i>– Juan Perez Jr.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">FOOD PRICES</h4> 
<p><b>The big observation: </b>Trump attributed his 2024 victory over Biden partly to his pledge to bring down the cost of everyday goods like eggs. But a year later, Americans are more worried about being able to afford groceries than the rising cost of housing or health care, according to The POLITICO Poll.</p> 
<p>Half of those surveyed said they find it difficult to pay for food. And a majority, 55 percent, blame the Trump administration for the high prices — even as the White House emphasizes its focus on affordability and the economy ahead of the midterm.</p> 
<p><b>What really stood out:</b> As affordability increasingly becomes a political flashpoint, with Democrats eager to seize on GOP vulnerabilities, a meaningful share of Trump’s own voters — 22 percent — blame the president for the high grocery costs.</p> 
<p><b>What now?</b> Balancing those concerns with a president who has put tariffs on goods imported from all over the world is a challenge for Trump’s administration — and an issue Democrats are certain to keep prodding.</p> 
<p>– <i>Rachel Shin</i></p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">HOUSING</h4> 
<p><b>The big observation: </b>Concerns about housing costs — which have represented a major share of inflation in recent years — eclipsed those for health care, utilities, commuting expenses and child care, The POLITICO Poll found.</p> 
<p>Only grocery costs bested the issue across more than a dozen expenses when respondents were asked to identify the items they find “the most challenging” to afford. The high cost of housing is also coming through in other metrics: The median age of first-time homebuyers climbed to a record high of 40 this year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p> 
<p><b>What really stood out: </b>The POLITICO Poll found that homebuying and rental costs were of particular concern for young and Hispanic adults, two constituencies whose support for Trump last year helped Republicans regain control of Washington. There’s also an interesting wrinkle among GOP voters. While only 10 percent of those who identified as MAGA Republicans believe the Trump administration is responsible for the housing costs they see as unfavorable (52 percent of them point to the Biden administration), that figure was three times higher for non-MAGA Republican respondents.</p> 
<p><b>What now? </b>Those surveyed spread the blame for high housing costs across the Trump and Biden administrations, state and local governments and private landlords. But it's Republicans who have to protect their hold on Washington heading into the midterms while the president generally dismissed affordability this week as “a hoax that was started by Democrats.”</p> 
<p><i>– Cassandra Dumay&nbsp;</i></p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">HEALTH CARE COSTS</h4> 
<p><b>The big observation: </b>Nearly half of American adults find it difficult to afford health care, according to The POLITICO Poll. Health care ranked as the No. 3 cost concern for respondents.</p> 
<p>Democrats are pushing to extend pandemic-era enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. If they end, prices will skyrocket for many Americans who buy insurance through the Obamacare marketplace. Democrats, who have struggled since Trump’s victory to coalesce around a campaign message, are banking on health care costs and other affordability concerns being a winning issue for them in the midterms.</p> 
<p><b>What really stood out:</b> The divide between MAGA and non-MAGA. While 84 percent of people who identified as MAGA Republicans said they trusted the GOP to bring down the cost of health care for everyday Americans (7 percent of which actually trusted the Democratic Party more on this issue), 49 percent of non-MAGA Republicans felt the same way. And nearly a quarter — 24 percent — of the non-MAGA respondents put their faith in Democrats on this issue.</p> 
<p><b>What now?</b> While poll respondents overall said they were more likely to trust Democrats to bring down health care costs, the overall split may not be concerning to Republicans running for reelection: 42 percent favored Democrats on the issue, compared with 33 percent favoring Republicans. The question becomes whether the non-MAGA Republicans can be persuaded to break ranks, or undecided voters are wooed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of President Donald Trump’s remarks on the economy in a swing district in Northeastern Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, his self-grading of an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus” on a key midterm issue is roiling the campaign trail.</p> 
<p>Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said in an exclusive statement to POLITICO that Trump’s remark — delivered during his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693" target="_blank">sitdown with POLITICO's Dasha Burns</a> for a special episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVV1tbNZf_A" target="_blank">“The Conversation”</a> released this morning — is out of touch with reality.</p> 
<p>“The President’s statement does not reflect the reality on the ground here in a community where many Pennsylvanians voted for him in the last election,” Shapiro said in the statement. “The record is clear: his policies have hurt the very communities that propelled him to the White House. Trump’s tariffs and economic policies have raised prices at the grocery store, shuttered markets for our farmers, hurt our manufacturers, and dramatically increased the cost of living for Pennsylvanians.”</p> 
<p>During the interview with POLITICO, Trump was asked what grade he would give his economy, to which he responded: “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” That remark comes despite consistent polling, including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nrid=debd2ece-ee29-4799-8096-e8d0e9b07edd" target="_blank">a recent POLITICO Poll</a>, that shows voters are feeling pinched. According to the most recent Consumer Price Index, prices rose 3 percent over the 12 months ending in September. Trump’s top advisers, meanwhile, are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trump-will-again-test-his-blame-democrats-message-on-the-economy-this-time-at-a-casino-00683164" target="_blank">pitching his Pennsylvania trip</a> as an attempt to reboot an affordability message that’s been hindered by his insistence that the economy is strong.</p> 
<p>The president’s comments to POLITICO on the economy are already being turned into a cudgel against him heading into the midterms, as Shapiro’s response — and other Democrats — shows.</p> 
<p>Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, another potential 2028 candidate, joined Shapiro in dinging Trump for the comments. “Must be graded on a curve that excludes rent, groceries, and healthcare,” <a href="https://x.com/jbpritzker/status/1998443221119066194?s=46&amp;t=GPh3c25gfQdn5J6Z9z3Vsw" target="_blank">Pritzker wrote in a post on X</a>.</p> 
<p>“Bringing his alternative reality and talking points to our Commonwealth won’t bring down the cost of groceries or make life more affordable for working families,” Shapiro continued in the statement. “Instead of trying to put on a show, he should get to work with Democrats and Republicans to actually cut costs for hard working families — as we have done here in Pennsylvania.”</p> 
<p>Steve Bannon, a MAGA stalwart and host of “The War Room” podcast, told POLITICO that he trusts in Trump’s ability to carry forward the message on affordability and cost-of-living issues.</p> 
<p>“If you're gonna go on the road, go on it, but he’s showing you that he’s the best person to sell his program,” Bannon said. “And if you don’t believe it’s an ‘A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus,’ then you're not the right guy to sell it.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) was asked during an appearance on Fox Business earlier on Tuesday whether he agreed with Trump’s grade of the economy — the specifics of which he steered clear from. “I think the starting point is we're digging out of a huge hole that we're in as a result of the Biden administration,” <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1998425704631824540?s=20" target="_blank">he said</a>. “What the president is saying is we’ve done a remarkable amount over the last 12 months. The economy is better. … But there’s a lot more work to do. Working families that are still living paycheck to paycheck, they’re still feeling crunched — by health care, by energy costs.”</p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Kush Desai <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trump-will-again-test-his-blame-democrats-message-on-the-economy-this-time-at-a-casino-00683164" target="_blank">told POLITICO</a> that “much work remains” but that “putting an end to Joe Biden’s inflation and affordability crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump” and ticked off accomplishments including “slashing costly regulations to securing historic drug pricing deals efforts that have cooled inflation and raised real wages.”</p> 
<p>Stacy Garrity, the GOP gubernatorial candidate and Pennsylvania state treasurer — who was scheduled to attend Trump’s visit to Mount Pocono and has <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/garrity-and-meuser-bring-potential-gubernatorial-pitches-to-conservative-conference/" target="_blank">backed his tariffs</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1940757598761816555?s=20" target="_blank">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a> — didn’t specifically address Trump’s economic grade when asked if she agreed with the assessment. Matt Beynon, a spokesperson for Garrity, said she is “looking forward to joining President Trump” and that the “treasurer is looking forward to being a partner with” Trump and “not a courtroom opponent like Josh Shapiro.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rahm Emanuel, who is mulling a presidential run, is pushing for the United States to follow Australia's lead in banning children under 16 from most social media. </p> 
<p>Alarmed by the addictive nature of social media apps and the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/22/teens-social-media-and-mental-health/" target="_blank">attendant health and safety risks</a> for young users, Emanuel wants to amp up public pressure on American lawmakers to restrict access to some of the world’s most popular platforms.</p> 
<p>In a bit of irony, the potential 2028 White House hopeful plans to issue his call to action Tuesday, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/07/world/asia/australia-social-media-ban-under-16.html" target="_blank">Australia’s ban takes effect</a>, in a video he’ll post on his social media accounts, according to plans the Democrat shared first with POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“We’ve got to make a choice when it comes to our adolescents: Who’s going to be a kind of moral guiding light? I put my thumb on the scale for adults over algorithms,” Emanuel said in an interview, accusing Big Tech of prioritizing profits over “protecting our adolescents.”</p> 
<p>It’s the latest in a series of policy stances Emanuel is sharpening as the former ambassador, who worked for three Democratic presidents and was mayor of Chicago, calls out his party’s messaging <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/democrats-need-an-education-reset-c70711de?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcR4Xn-hCd3cP6t8RvYkiRfqN5sy8X9o5jFJUiC-RaO9hNqK36fS7Sgk1WuFOQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693752af&amp;gaa_sig=TTovCzsQutNXzSznCtfnLcYyJqL69TovTxAeKHZ6_47OK_vlVw_Xil7RdAKu67trB3_EOsAFIXEjAknHLwrlfw%3D%3D" target="_blank">from education</a> to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/rahm-emanuel-crime-democrats-00647488" target="_blank">public safety</a> ahead of a critical midterm election.</p> 
<p>It also comes as Democrats are embracing social media influencers and encouraging political leaders and candidates to spend more time online to promote their messaging and reach younger voters.</p> 
<p>But Emanuel sees those as separate issues — an electoral strategy targeted toward adults over 18 versus a public health problem affecting adolescents. He likened solving it to steps he took to curb youth smoking as mayor by <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2016/06/28/starting-july-1-you-must-be-21-buy-tobacco-products-chicago" target="_blank">raising the minimum age to buy tobacco products</a>. And he suggested lawmakers should start with targeting three of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/teens-and-social-media-fact-sheet/" target="_blank">most popular apps among U.S. teens</a> — TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.</p> 
<p>“We can’t lose another generation because of inaction or political gridlock,” he said.</p> 
<p>Emanuel appears to be taking a tougher stance on youth access to social media than some of his would-be rivals for the Democratic nomination — and positioning himself against the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/technology/netchoice-free-speech-meta-google.html" target="_blank">Big Tech lobby that has fiercely opposed efforts</a> to regulate who accesses their platforms by arguing it infringes upon free speech. As a candidate, he too received donations from tech giants, including Eric Schmidt and Sheryl Sandberg.</p> 
<p>Asked about those contributions, he said his stance now shows his independence from those firms.</p> 
<p>In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed bills this fall that require social media platforms to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/13/california-health-warning-labels-social-media-00606066" target="_blank">display health warning labels to minors</a> and require apps to check kids' ages. Both Newsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, have spoken out about social media's impact on kids' mental health.</p> 
<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed a “Kids Code” last year that aims to limit data tech companies can collect from children, but is <a href="https://thedailyrecord.com/2025/12/01/maryland-kids-code-lawsuit-netchoice-first-amendment/" target="_blank">mired in a legal battle</a>. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law in 2023 that works to <a href="https://www.wbez.org/reset-with-sasha-ann-simons/2024/07/01/new-illinois-law-protecting-child-social-media-creators-now-in-effect" target="_blank">ensure children are compensated</a> for appearing in online content.</p> 
<p>Emanuel, asked if his proposed social-media ban would be key to his platform should he run for president, said “anything that allows us to keep focus on improving academic standards and protecting our children on a public-health basis is going to be a priority.”</p> 
<p>Australia’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/12/31/australia-social-media-ban-us-00194589" target="_blank">world-first social media ban</a> is designed to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-09/teenagers-who-support-social-media-ban/106095948" target="_blank">restrict access to major social media platforms</a> including Facebook, Instagram, X, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube for children under 16. And it threatens to slap their parent companies with tens of millions of dollars in fines if they don’t take “reasonable steps” to prevent youngsters’ access. Tech firms had protested the measure as rushed and <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/tiktok-australias-submission-regarding-the-online-safety-age-restricted-social-media-platforms-rules?lang=en-AU" target="_blank">“short-sighted”</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-au/products/whats-changing-on-youtube-in-australia/" target="_blank">argued it “will not fulfill its promise</a> to make kids safer online.” But they have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxekqryn1jo" target="_blank">already begun</a> deactivating accounts.</p> 
<p>There’s some support for a similar ban in the U.S. Nearly six in 10 voters in a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3917" target="_blank">Quinnipiac University poll</a> conducted in late 2024 said they would like to see similar age restrictions, though support was lower among those ages 18 to 34. An August <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000198-c53c-d016-a9fb-dfbcb5a90000" target="_blank">POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll</a> of registered California voters showed 45 percent support for banning social media for kids under 16.</p> 
<p>A bipartisan group of senators — including Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who political insiders think is positioning himself for another White House run in 2028 and who has made kids’ online safety a <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/01/29/cruz-takes-up-kids-online-safety-00201108" target="_blank">centerpiece of his stint chairing the panel</a> that oversees social media — <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_1748" target="_blank">introduced a bill</a> earlier this year that would <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/02/senate-bill-to-keep-kids-off-social-media-advances-00202625" target="_blank">ban children under age 13 from social media</a>. Emanuel said that legislation has “the right thrust.”</p> 
<p>Another <a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2025/5/technology/blackburn-blumenthal-thune-and-schumer-introduce-the-kids-online-safety-act" target="_blank">bipartisan group of senators has reintroduced a bill</a> that would require social media firms to remove features that could have negative effects on youth mental health. The bill sailed through the Senate 91-3 last year but stalled in the House, and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/12/03/lawmakers-kids-may-stifle-online-safety-laws-00674330" target="_blank">two chambers remain at odds over the details</a>.</p> 
<p>Amid congressional gridlock, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/13/kids-online-states-social-media-00135390" target="_blank">patchwork of primarily red states have passed laws</a> attempting to limit kids’ access to social media by requiring parental consent and imposing digital curfews. But those efforts have drawn resistance from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/net-choice-arkansas-huckabee-sanders-a228cad0c8ed00e4be0b637e12b73f09" target="_blank">industry groups</a> representing tech giants like Meta, Alphabet and Snapchat and have <a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/04/01/federal-judge-declares-arkansas-social-media-age-verification-law-unconstitutional/" target="_blank">been largely blocked</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-social-media-age-verification-law-lawsuit-51b4ce108f0d22adadc50d50e0392dd4" target="_blank">by courts</a>.</p> 
<p>Still, a divided panel of appeals judges last month gave Florida the go-ahead to begin <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/11/appeals-court-gives-florida-the-ok-to-enforce-child-social-media-restrictions-00669300" target="_blank">enforcing a law</a> signed by one-time presidential aspirant, GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, that bars children under age 14 from using many social media platforms and requires parental approval for those ages 14 and 15. DeSantis, who might mount another White House bid in 2028, has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/25/desantis-childen-social-media-ban-00148805" target="_blank">hailed the law</a> as a way of keeping children safe from online predators.</p> 
<p>Emanuel acknowledged the stiff legal challenges a sweeping social media ban could face. But he said there’s a potentially “winning argument” in casting the crackdowns as combating “a public health issue associated with technology” rather than the technology itself.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indiana Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray reiterated his opposition to redrawing the state’s congressional lines as his legislative body began to consider a new, state House-passed map Monday.</p> 
<p>But he would not say whether his caucus had enough votes to pass the measure being pushed by President Donald Trump, as he aims to keep Republicans’ slim control over Congress next year. Recalcitrant Republicans in the Hoosier State have presented the president with one of the biggest political tests of his second term.</p> 
<p>“We’ll all find out on Thursday,” Bray said. It was a notable change from his regular insistence the GOP-controlled Senate lacks the votes to pass a mid-cycle redistricting measure.</p> 
<p>Bray also addressed threats of violence against many of his own members received after signaling they don’t support remapping the state ahead of next year’s midterm election.</p> 
<p>“It's unsettling for all of our members and people across the state to endure that,” he said of the dozen or so elected Indiana Republicans who have faced threats of pipe bombings, swattings and <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-threats-fake-pizza-deliveries-trump-roft" target="_blank">unsolicited deliveries of Domino’s pizza</a>.</p> 
<p>The Senate convened ahead of what is elected to be a final Thursday vote on the map the House passed last week. It would all but ensure GOP control over Indiana’s nine House seats, up from their current 7-2 advantage. Bray cautioned it’s possible the vote could slip to Friday.</p> 
<p>As senators convened for a 13-minute session before adjourning for the day Monday, anti-redirecting protesters drowned out much of the proceedings with chants of “No means no” and “no cheaters.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s aggressive remapping push, spearheaded in Texas, has withered in the face of state-level opposition elsewhere in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett declared a U.S. Senate run on Monday, jolting an already contentious Democratic primary as the party banks on flipping the reliably red state in its push to retake control of Congress’ upper chamber.</p> 
<p>Crockett, a two-term representative from Dallas, will challenge state Rep. James Talarico, a rising star within the Democratic Party. Despite polling suggesting an uphill battle, Democrats feel <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/08/texas-senate-dems-paxton-cornyn-00393332" target="_blank"><u>optimistic</u></a> about winning statewide in Texas for the first time in decades by harnessing the same backlash to President Donald Trump that fueled their successful off-cycle elections last month. In 2018, the party caught a glimmer of hope when Beto O’Rourke came within 2 points of defeating Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in a blue wave.</p> 
<p>Former Rep. Colin Allred, the first Democrat to get into the race, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/allred-drops-out-of-texas-senate-race-00680502" target="_blank"><u>dropped out</u></a> on Monday ahead of Crockett’s announcement, citing a desire to avoid a messy primary and the likelihood of a runoff that would be triggered if no candidate receives a majority of the first round of votes in the <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/important-election-dates.shtml#2026" target="_blank"><u>March 3 primary</u></a>. It was Allred's second attempt at a Senate run: He lost to Cruz in 2024 by more than 8 percentage points.</p> 
<p>“For too long, Texas has elected Senators who have defended politics as usual and protected the status quo, while Texans have paid the price,” Crockett said on her campaign <a href="https://www.jasmineforus.com/" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>. “We’ve had Senators who have pushed the American Dream further and further out of reach.”</p> 
<p>“I’m running for the United States Senate because I believe Texas deserves a Senator who will be an independent voice for all 30 million Texans – not a rubber stamp or party line vote for Donald Trump."</p> 
<p>Ahead of the rally, Crockett released a 45-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bom6iadL9mI" target="_blank"><u>video</u></a> with audio of Trump calling her “the new star” of the Democratic party and a “very low IQ person.”</p> 
<p>In recent weeks, Crockett publicly debated whether to jump in, saying she would only do so if polling showed she could win. She has said she believes she can expand the electorate in Texas, a formidable task given the state’s entrenched Republican politics and rightward shift in 2024, including in former Democratic strongholds along the border. She’ll kick off with an event Monday afternoon in Dallas.</p> 
<p>Crockett will be able to draw on a national profile and strong fundraising network. As a House member in a solidly blue district, she raised more than $6.5 million as of the end of September, largely online from small-dollar donors, and had $4.6 million in her campaign account — funds that can immediately be used to propel her Senate run. </p> 
<p>Crockett is known for going head to head against GOP rivals, and has attracted criticism for some of her comments, such as calling wheelchair-bound Texas Gov. Greg Abbott “hot wheels.” She also referred to GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as having a “bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body” during a House Oversight Committee hearing.</p> 
<p>Some Texas Democrats said they believe Crockett brings a shot of enthusiasm – and her assertiveness is what the Democratic electorate is clamoring for. “We need some out loud, bold progressives, and that's what people like about her,” said Allison Campolo, chairwoman of the Tarrant County Democratic Party. “She doesn't shy away from anything. She doesn't run to the middle.”</p> 
<p>Crockett has faced obstacles in the House, coming up short in a bid for a caucus <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/house-dem-leaders-jeffries-clark-aguilar-minority-00190394" target="_blank"><u>leadership position</u></a> and for Democrats’ top position on the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/24/congress/robert-garcia-house-oversight-leader-00420272" target="_blank"><u>Oversight Committee</u></a>. Now her Senate bid is causing some musical chairs in the House, brought on by the Texas GOP’s new gerrymander. Her decision to run for Senate wards off one potentially tough member-on-member primary for her current seat, but Allred’s switch to vie for a recently redrawn House seat against Rep. Julie Johnson is forcing another messy primary in a safe blue district.</p> 
<p>Republicans say Crockett’s combative <a href="https://x.com/TeamCornyn/status/1997052735917584439?s=20" target="_blank"><u>reputation</u></a> will disqualify her among moderate Texans. Sen. John Cornyn has been goading Crockett into the race, and his campaign believes she will be easily defeated in a general election. <b>C</b>ornyn told reporters Monday that he thinks Crockett wins the primary "but she's the worst possible candidate they can have in Texas."</p> 
<p>But first Cornyn would have to survive a packed and bloody Republican primary. And his vulnerability among conservative primary voters who question his MAGA bonafides has Democrats frothing at the opportunity to flip the seat. He’s up against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a far-right firebrand who’s often considered the frontrunner since <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/08/ken-paxton-texas-senate-john-cornyn-00280033" target="_blank"><u>launching</u></a> his campaign in April. Rep. Wesley Hunt jumped into the race in October, essentially guaranteeing the early March primary will go to a runoff.</p> 
<p>Democrats are staking their hopes of flipping Texas on a continued GOP split — and the possibility of Paxton, whom they view as a weaker candidate, advancing to the general election.</p> 
<p>Crockett <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2025/12/02/jasmine-crockett-decision-run-senate-john-cornyn-james-talarico/" target="_blank"><u>told the Dallas Morning News</u></a> last week that she had called Allred and Talarico to discuss polling she had commissioned showing she could win the election. Talarico’s campaign said she never actually shared the survey when they spoke. Talarico has achieved fame for his liberal view of Christianity and involvement in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/18/texas-democrats-return-quorum-redistricting-00513351" target="_blank"><u>walkout</u></a> staged by Texas state lawmakers over Republicans gerrymandering a congressional map at Trump’s request.</p> 
<p>“Our movement is rooted in unity over division — so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race,” Talarico said in a statement.</p> 
<p>The biggest question facing Crockett is whether she’ll be able to translate her popularity in Dallas statewide, said Joel Montfort, a Texas-based Democratic strategist. </p> 
<p>“I appreciate her scrappiness and abilities to go toe to toe with her detractors. She is quick witted and quite the firebrand,” he said. “Her key challenge will be getting the other urban and suburban voters in other cities to appreciate what she brings to the party.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Texas Rep. Colin Allred ended his Senate run on Monday as challenger Jasmine Crockett prepares to announce her likely bid for the seat that has long eluded Democrats.</p> 
<p>Allred instead declared his intention to run for Congress in Rep. Julie Johnson’s seat. A resident of Dallas, he was making his second attempt to unseat a Texas Republican in the Senate after losing to Sen. Ted Cruz in 2024.</p> 
<p>Allred was facing the possibility of a crowded Democratic primary: He was already up against state Rep. James Talarico, a rising star within the Democratic Party. Allred lagged in fundraising behind Talarico, and Crockett – an outspoken member with a strong national profile – would also prove to be a formidable challenger.</p> 
<p>Allred, in a statement, said he wanted to avoid a messy Senate primary and will instead run for Congress in the newly drawn 33rd Congressional District, which had its lines redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court last week allowed Texas to use a new GOP-friendly map drawn this year. His switch comes on the final day candidates can file to run in Texas for the March primary.</p> 
<p>A bruising primary is taking place on the Republican side: Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton or Rep. Wesley Hunt are dueling for the GOP nomination.</p> 
<p>“In the past few days, I’ve come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlikkers Paxton, Cornyn or Hunt,” he said in a <a href="https://x.com/ColinAllredTX/status/1998015894878830941?s=20" target="_blank"><u>statement</u></a>. “That’s why I’ve made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate.”</p> 
<p>Democrats need to net four seats to regain control of the Senate — a tough task that they believe was made easier by their sweeping success around the country on Election Day last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump’s maximalist, command-and-control approach to the GOP faces one of its most significant tests yet, as a band of stubborn Indiana state Senate Republicans threatens his mid-cycle redistricting scheme when it is expected to come to a vote this week.</p> 
<p>The Hoosier Republicans will gavel in Monday to decide on a map, passed Friday by the Indiana House, that supporters say would all but guarantee a 9-0 Republican congressional delegation and would be in effect for next year’s pivotal midterm elections. Present maps give the GOP a 7-2 advantage.</p> 
<p>Senate President Pro Tempore <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/redistricting-indiana-resistance-00663698" target="_blank"><u>Rodric Bray</u></a>, who — along with roughly half his 40-member Republican majority — has resisted a four-month White House pressure campaign to redraw the congressional lines. Indiana Conservation Voters, Club for Growth and Building a Better Economy are among the groups that have spent nearly half-a-million dollars in ads trying to sway public opinion — the first group against redistricting and the second two for — in recent weeks, according to AdImpact. Trump campaign veterans like Chris LaCivita have joined the dark money group Fair Maps Indiana to advance the cause, too. </p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson has been calling reluctant Republican state senators in recent days — reported here for the first time, based on accounts from two people granted anonymity to freely discuss sensitive private conversations. One Indiana Republican elected official briefed on the calls said Johnson’s “soft touch” with lawmakers may be moving the needle.</p> 
<p>“Anybody who tells you they know how this is going to play out doesn’t know,” this person said.</p> 
<p>A Johnson spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p><img src="https://static.politico.com/f5/08/415e6bc346d3a005c25dbf8e4e69/u-s-congress-27873.jpg" alt="House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks with reporters as he departs a vote at the U.S. Capitol Dec. 3, 2025." data-portal-copyright="Francis Chung/POLITICO" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks with reporters as he departs a vote at the U.S. Capitol Dec. 3, 2025."/><p><br>The matter is top of mind for the president, who brought up Indiana redistricting to visitors at a White House Christmas party Sunday attended by Gov. Mike Braun, according to a person present and granted anonymity to disclose the conversation. Trump asked Braun in front of other guests if redistricting would pass, and Braun responded it would.</p> 
<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump “thinks we should fight democrats every legal way we can to win the majority and keep accomplishing things for the people," according to a Republican close to the White House granted anonymity to discuss the president’s motivations.</p> 
<p>And on Friday, Turning Point Action announced that it was partnering with several Trump-aligned super PACs to target Indiana Republicans who are blocking the president’s redistricting effort, including threatening to spend millions of dollars to primary resistant members of the Indiana GOP.</p> 
<p>Trump needs the backup: The state Senate’s reservations threaten to derail his plans to push new maps across the country to shore up his party’s slim House majority, which Democrats would seize by netting just three seats in an election that is expected to be a repudiation of the party in power.</p> 
<p>“These guys and ladies are under intense, 24-hour-a-day pressure and I don’t know if they can withstand it, ultimately — we will see,” said Mike Murphy, a former Republican member of the Indiana House of Representatives. “I feel badly for them and their families, primarily. They came to be public servants, and instead they are pawns in really what I consider to be Trump’s strategy to avoid a third impeachment and potentially set himself up a third term.”</p> 
<p>The Trump-backed pressure campaign in Indiana has included two visits from Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis on Air Force Two, and repeated calls and invitations to Oval Office meetings — including with Trump, Bray and Speaker of the House Todd Huston in August.</p> 
<p>Now, lawmakers will convene amid threats of violence following Trump’s series of social media posts ramping up pressure. At least <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/indiana-republicans-swatting-attacks-redistricting-rcna246689" target="_blank"><u>a dozen elected Indiana Republicans have faced swattings</u></a> — false reports of danger that bring an aggressive law enforcement response designed to intimidate the target — and pipe bomb threats. Few though have publicly reversed their positions against redistricting since they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/redistricting-indiana-resistance-00663698" target="_blank">stalemated 19-19</a>last month on a vote that was a close proxy for gerrymandering. That means Trump and the White House would need to flip at least half a dozen GOP senators to secure a simple majority to pass the new maps.</p><img src="https://static.politico.com/dd/34/28dac23447af96cd609c0ec620b2/trump-kennedy-center-honors-67223.jpg" alt="President Donald Trump speaks at a Kennedy Center Honors reception for recipients Sylvester Stallone, George Strait, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor and Michael Crawford at the State Department, Saturday, Dec. 6, 2025, in Washington.

Greg Walker <a href="https://dailyjournal.net/2025/11/26/sen-greg-walker-declines-oval-office-visit-accuses-white-house-of-violating-hatch-act/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook" target="_blank"><u>told a local newspaper</u></a> in November.</p> 
<p>Three Indiana Republicans close to the process — and granted anonymity to appraise support — said they do not believe there are currently enough votes in the Senate for the map to pass.</p> 
<p>Asked whether he felt pressured by the White House to redistrict, Huston would only say, “We had conversations. There was no secret.”</p> 
<p>Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115669815800105560" target="_blank"><u>posted twice</u></a> on Truth Social this weekend about his demand for redistricting in Indiana, the barn-red state he once called “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-indiana-town-importantville-final-push/story?id=38831692" target="_blank"><u>Importantville”</u></a> and that helped him clinch the GOP nomination in its May 2016 primary, saying, “this new Map would give the incredible people of Indiana the opportunity to elect TWO additional Republicans in the 2026 Midterm Elections.” He also posted the names of nine senators who "need encouragement to make the right decision” as they have not yet declared their position on the new map.</p> 
<p>Turning Point last week <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/12/06/turning-point-tests-its-potency-in-indiana-00679727" target="_blank"><u>deployed members</u></a> of their “strike force” to meet with and whip many of those same senators, but the results of that effort remain unclear. “It's so hard to judge at this point, because it's such a fluid situation,” said Brett Galaszewski, Turning Point Action’s national enterprise director.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile the Supreme Court reinstated Texas’ newly drawn congressional map last week, staving off <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/05/trump-redistricting-fight-indiana-pressure-00678789" target="_blank"><u>a major setback</u></a> to Trump's redistricting campaign. Now, the GOP has nine more favorable seats across four states — Texas, Ohio, Missouri and North Carolina. Those will likely be offset by the five Democratic seats California Gov. Gavin Newsom scored in his counterpunch last month.</p> 
<p>Redistricting battles are brewing around the country, with Democrat-led Virginia and Maryland headed in opposite directions of one another.</p> 
<p>Virginia Democrats expanded their grip on power in the General Assembly by picking up 13 House seats while flipping three Republican-held statewide offices, including governor, in last month’s elections. Top Democrats in the state legislature appear unfazed by Indiana’s push to redraw its maps. The state’s top Democrat said it was “<a href="https://www.virginiascope.com/surovell-redistricting-is-full-steam-ahead/" target="_blank">full steam ahead</a>” – a reference to the state lawmakers clearing a procedural hurdle in October to put a constitutional amendment before voters to allow the Democratic-led legislature to redraw its maps ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>“We have a plan and process in place that will facilitate delivery of our maps on time,” state Sen. L. Louise Lucas said via text Saturday. “Virginia is a good place to be.” Don Scott, the Virginia House speaker, opined that a new map could drastically change the delegation makeup in Virginia, which is near parity with six Democrats and five Republicans.</p> 
<p>Scott said “10-1 is not out of the realm to be able to draw the maps in a succinct and community-based way," at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwMNcMm3f34" target="_blank">a public forum last week</a>.</p> 
<p>And in Maryland, Gov. Wes Moore continues to pressure his state lawmakers to take up new maps, but has run into opposition from state Senate President Bill Ferguson, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/bill-ferguson-wes-moore-00664770" target="_blank">has refused to entertain bringing up a vote</a> on the matter.</p> 
<p>Maryland’s lower chamber appears poised to take up the issue, but House Speaker Adrienne Jones, who earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerAJones/status/1983634799953891495" target="_blank">publicly supported the governor’s redistricting push</a>, stunned many in Annapolis by announcing Thursday <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/04/jones-to-step-down-ending-historic-era-as-house-speaker/" target="_blank">she was immediately stepping down.</a>It’s unclear what impact this will have on negotiations to redraw the state’s lines.</p> 
<p>Moore’s Redistricting Advisory Commission, set up last month to solicit residents’ feedback on whether to craft new maps, is slated to hold its final public meeting Friday before it issues recommendations to the governor and Maryland General Assembly.</p> 
<p>Trump set the latest redistricting arms race in motion when he leaned on Texas to redraw its maps earlier this summer.</p> 
<p>“We don’t operate in a vacuum and states are doing this all across the country, red and blue states,” Huston told reporters Friday. “We felt like it was important for us to be a part of that, and to make sure that we used every tool we could to support a strong Republican majority.”</p> 
<p>Asked whether he felt “proud” of the maps, Huston, who <a href="https://x.com/TomDaviesIND/status/1973749751360442806?s=20" target="_blank"><u>said in 2021</u></a> that he would “defend these maps all day long, six days to Sunday,” did not use that word, saying he felt “very blessed to lead the Indiana House of Representative.”</p> 
<p>“I support this, and I support what we’re doing,” he said.</p> 
<p>The state Senate committee on elections will meet in the Senate chamber to hear the congressional map Monday afternoon, with a final vote from the whole chamber expected Thursday.</p> 
<p>Trump’s demands on Indiana lawmakers though have exposed some of the limits of his power.</p> 
<p>“The MAGA movement hasn’t permeated down to the state legislative level,” said an Indiana Republican allied with Trump’s redistricting cause.</p> 
<p>But this person, granted anonymity to discuss the tense debate, referenced primaries of resistant Indiana Republicans, saying, “we’re either going to get new maps, or we’re going to get a new Senate.”</p> 
<p>“Some people think Trumpworld is bluffing or doesn’t have any juice left and this will just go away if the state Senate rejects the maps,” this person said. “The reality is that will only be the start of a long and brutal campaign to purge the state of anyone who opposed Trump on this issue. And there will likely be collateral damage that hurts even those who supported Trump.”</p>

      <description>Every week political cartoonists throughout the country and across the political spectrum apply their ink-stained skills to capture the foibles, memes, hypocrisies and other head-slapping events in the world of politics. The fruits of these labors are hundreds of cartoons that entertain and enrage readers of all political stripes. Here's an offering of the best of this week's crop, picked fresh off the Toonosphere.
