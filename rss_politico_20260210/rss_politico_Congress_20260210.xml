      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> said Monday he is moving forward with a plan to revive a prohibition on House votes to overturn President Donald Trump's global tariffs.</p> 
<p>Johnson told reporters he believes he will have the votes to include the block in a procedural measure set for House consideration Tuesday. The House Rules Committee <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/rule_hr2189hr261hr3617.pdf" target="_blank">approved legislation Monday</a> that would prevent any further tariff votes through July 31.</p> 
<p>The move comes after a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975" target="_blank">previous blockade imposed by GOP leaders</a> expired — and House Democrats threatened to force a vote as soon as Wednesday that would <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/09/congress/house-vote-canada-tariffs-00772224" target="_blank">effectively cancel Trump's tariffs on Canada</a>.</p> 
<p>But it is far from clear that Johnson will actually have the necessary votes. A band of House Republicans are already pushing back on the plans, with a group of at least six tariff-skeptical GOP members discussing the matter on the floor Monday night. With united Democratic opposition expected, nays from as few as two Republicans could derail the effort.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House on Monday night passed its bipartisan <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/12/house-financial-services-introduces-bipartisan-housing-package-00688305" target="_blank">housing package</a> aimed at increasing home supply and affordability, setting up an uncertain effort to merge the measure with a Senate housing bill.</p> 
<p>House lawmakers approved by a vote of 390-9 the <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/02/house-republicans-eye-next-week-for-housing-bill-vote-00761249#:~:text=Housing%20in%20the%2021st%20Century%20Act" target="_blank">Housing in the 21st Century Act</a> under suspension of the rules, a fast-track procedure for non-controversial legislation. The bill includes provisions to modernize local development and rural housing programs, expand manufactured and affordable housing, protect borrowers and those utilizing federal housing programs and enhance oversight of housing providers. The package also contained a recently added section aimed at increasing community bank lending.</p> 
<p>Congress must now work to get a unified bill to the president’s desk. The Senate passed its own bipartisan housing affordability package in October, which was supported by the White House. Financial Services Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227472" data-person-id="227472">French Hill</a> (R-Ark.) — who spearheaded the House bill with ranking member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51664" data-person-id="51664">Maxine Waters</a> (D-Calif.) — told reporters Monday he plans to negotiate with the administration as well as his counterparts on the Senate Banking Committee to get a final version which both chambers and the White House can support.</p> 
<p>“We wanted to get [the housing bill and other committee priorities] through the House so that we could work with the Senate to find packages that the President could sign into law, long before the very active summer campaign season,” Hill said. “So I would hope that we could work over the spring and find a way to have a bicameral, bipartisan set of bills.”</p> 
<p>Hill has previously said the Senate bill, the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_2651" target="_blank">ROAD to Housing Act</a>, contained a number of provisions that House Republicans would likely not support. Although the House and Senate bills share many similarities, the Senate measure includes a number of grant programs that would expand federal spending.</p> 
<p>But Senate Banking ranking member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/140963" data-person-id="140963">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) said that she still wants the House to take up the Senate bill, setting the stage for a potential clash. Support from Senate Democrats will likely be necessary to get housing legislation through the upper chamber.</p> 
<p>“ROAD to Housing is a Jenga tower. Adding or taking things away risks losing the unanimous coalition that we have built in the Senate,” Warren said in an interview.</p> 
<p>Warren also signaled that she disapproved of the new section added to the House legislation, which would ease regulation on community banks — reflecting Hill’s <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/01/hill-barr-introduce-community-banking-package-00715479?site=pro&amp;prod=alert&amp;prodname=alertmail&amp;linktype=headline&amp;source=email" target="_blank">“Make Community Banking Great Again” agenda</a>.</p> 
<p>“House Republicans should not hold housing relief hostage to push forward several bank deregulatory bills that will make our community banks more fragile,” Warren said in a statement before Monday’s House vote.</p>

      <title>Lawmakers don't rule out exposing redacted names of powerful men in Epstein files</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie are challenging the Justice Department for redacting the names of six men in the publicly released materials related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — and they could take matters into their own hands to reveal their identities.</p> 
<p>These omissions, the two lawmakers argued Monday evening outside the Justice Department, could go beyond the scope of redactions that are permitted under the legislation they championed — and which President Donald Trump signed into law in November — to compel the full release of Epstein files within DOJ’s possession.</p> 
<p>And while they declined to share the names with reporters Monday, Massie, a Kentucky Republican, didn’t rule out taking steps to do so in the coming days. He told reporters he should “probably” broadcast the identity of the shielded individuals “from the floor or in a committee hearing,” where his remarks would be protected from lawsuits through the Speech and Debate Clause.</p> 
<p>“What we’re after is the men who Jeffrey Epstein trafficked women to,” said Massie, adding he would give DOJ officials the opportunity to “correct their mistakes” and reverse the redactions on their own before reading the names of the six men on the chamber floor or from a committee dais.</p> 
<p>Massie said at least one of the men was a U.S. citizen, another was a foreigner and the nationalities of others were unclear. He suggested authorities were investigating at least one of them.</p> 
<p>“There are six men, some of them with their photographs, that have been redacted, and there's no explanation why those people were redacted,” Khanna, a California Democrat, told reporters. “That’s really concerning.”</p> 
<p>Khanna and Massie were at a DOJ office building Monday to peruse the unredacted Epstein files, a privilege being afforded to members of Congress following the files' public release. The lawmakers scrutinized the unscrubbed materials on closely held computers — though Massie complained he was unable to view some documents that have since been taken down from the Justice Department website after being posted publicly.</p> 
<p>Khanna suggested that some materials may have been redacted before the Justice Department review — potentially by the FBI — complicating the process for complete transparency.</p> 
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, also viewed the unredacted materials earlier in the day Monday. He said there were about four computers for lawmakers’ use and viewers can only take written notes on what they see.</p> 
<p>“We didn't want to see any redactions of the names of co-conspirators, accomplices, enablers, abusers, rapists, simply to spare them potential embarrassment, political sensitivity or disgrace of some kind,” Raskin told reporters. “And yet nonetheless, the Epstein … documents that were released are filled with redactions of names and information about people who clearly are not victims and may fall into that other category.”</p> 
<p>He pointed to the redaction of Les Wexner’s identity as an example. Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria’s Secret, was an Epstein client and has a deposition scheduled before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee later this month.</p> 
<p>Raskin also said he saw one redacted document, a message from Epstein’s legal team regarding Trump. He recalled the note mentioned that Trump had identified Epstein as a guest, but not a member, of Mar-a-Lago.</p> 
<p>“That was redacted for some indeterminate, inscrutable reason,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Democrats are aiming to force a vote on President Donald Trump’s Canada tariffs as early as Wednesday.</p> 
<p>House Democrats still need to meet and decide when to offer the resolution, but it is likely to come Wednesday, according to two staffers granted anonymity to discuss private plans.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/51521" target="_blank">Gregory Meeks</a> (D-N.Y.) <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HJRES_72?q=H.J.Res.72" target="_blank">introduced the resolution</a> last March, but House Republican leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/11/congress/house-republicans-move-to-block-vote-on-trumps-tariffs-00223947" target="_blank">blocked a vote on the measure and any others</a> disapproving of Trump’s emergency powers to impose tariffs. That block <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975" target="_blank">expired in January</a>, after a group of Republicans pushed leadership to allow tariff votes.</p> 
<p>One of those lawmakers, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/6d3990d9-4e46-4bc9-a299-af8b3dad90fd" target="_blank">Don Bacon</a> (R-Neb.), said he is inclined to vote to end the tariffs on Canada.</p> 
<p>“We have a trade agreement with them, and I don’t like how the White House has treated our neighbor and ally,” Bacon said Monday in an interview.</p> 
<p>If it is offered, it would force a difficult vote for Republican lawmakers, who have faced sustained pressure from businesses in their districts over the costs and disruptions the tariffs have produced.</p> 
<p>The Senate has <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/29/congress/senate-votes-to-block-trumps-tariffs-on-canada-for-a-second-time-00629068" target="_blank">voted twice</a> to block Trump from imposing tariffs on Canada, first in April and then again in October. Four Republican Senators voted with the Democrats each time: <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/aa48154b-408e-4868-a88a-e4c2151d6492" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell</a> and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/4b1312cc-ee28-4ef7-aeac-bd4f852ca121" target="_blank">Rand Paul</a> of Kentucky, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/6c1b2696-bcf8-42e0-8d5f-b4d513a17758" target="_blank">Susan Collins</a> of Maine, and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/a5094dbc-f9c4-455a-875d-d56a1b3f0abd" target="_blank">Lisa Murkowski</a> of Alaska.</p> 
<p>The votes are largely symbolic — even if Congress disapproves of Trump’s national emergency, the president is likely to veto it, and it would require a two-thirds vote from both chambers to overturn his veto.</p> 
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/01/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-00201953" target="_blank">used his emergency powers</a> to impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from Canada, Mexico and China in February, accusing the three countries of failing to prevent undocumented migrants and fentanyl from flowing into the U.S.</p> 
<p>The administration exempted the majority of Canadian goods from those tariffs, however, if they comply with the existing U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.</p>

      <title>Howard Lutnick faces bipartisan calls to resign over latest Epstein revelations</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls to resign after he appeared in a recent batch of files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51608" data-person-id="51608">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) accused Lutnick in a statement Monday of having “lied” about the extent of his connection to Epstein. Lutnick has sought to downplay their relationship, saying in a podcast appearance last year he vowed in 2005 to never again be in the same room as Epstein.</p> 
<p>But files recently released by the Justice Department <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/epstein-europe-america-fallout-00769506" target="_blank">suggest he continued his interactions with Epstein</a>, including planning a visit several years later to Epstein’s Caribbean island.</p> 
<p>“Lutnick’s lies about his business dealings with a convicted child sex offender, raise serious concerns about his judgement and ethics,” Schiff said. “Lutnick has no business being our Commerce Secretary, and he should resign immediately.”</p> 
<p>Asked about the scrunity, White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond directly but said President Donald Trump "has assembled the best and most transformative cabinet in modern history." </p> 
<p>"The entire Trump administration, including Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce, remains focused on delivering for the American people,” he said.</p> 
<p>House Oversight Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260072" data-person-id="260072">James Comer</a> (R-Ky.), who is leading an investigation into Epstein and has already subpoenaed multiple associates, did not rule out issuing one for Lutnick. But he said the panel's outstanding subpoenas take priority for now.</p> 
<p>"We're interested in talking to anyone that might have any information that would help us get justice for the survivorship," he told reporters Monday.</p> 
<p>Schiff is joining a bipartisan chorus of House members who have called in recent days for Lutnick to either resign or be fired — neither of which appears to be on the precipice of happening.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198835" data-person-id="198835">Thomas Massie</a> (R-Ky.) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/politics/massie-howard-lutnick-epstein-files" target="_blank">told CNN</a> during an interview that aired over the weekend that Lutnick should “make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign.” House Democrats, including top Oversight Committee member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/420280" data-person-id="420280">Robert Garcia</a>, have also called on Lutnick to go.</p> 
<p>“It’s now clear that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been lying about his relationship with Epstein,” the Californian posted on X. “Lutnick must resign or be fired. And he must answer our questions.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The congressional investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein hit its latest snag Monday morning when Epstein’s longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, declined to answer questions in a sworn deposition.</p> 
<p>Maxwell, now serving a 20-year sentence for her part in Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme, invoked her Fifth Amendment right over video from a prison camp in Texas, months after she had been subpoenaed by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.</p> 
<p>In a copy of Maxwell's lawyer’s opening statement obtained by POLITICO, David Oscar Markus reiterated that grant of clemency would facilitate her testimony — a power only President Donald Trump can bestow. He has not ruled out issuing a pardon.</p> 
<p>“Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,” according to Markus’ prepared remarks. “For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.”</p> 
<p>He also noted some of Maxwell’s legal proceedings were still ongoing.</p> 
<p>Democrats accused Maxwell of using the deposition as part of a campaign for clemency from Trump, while House Oversight Chair James Comer told reporters he did not believe Maxwell should be granted clemency.</p> 
<p>“Unfortunately, she had an opportunity today to answer questions that every American has — questions that would be very important in this investigation — and she chose to invoke her Fifth Amendment right,” the Kentucky Republican said. </p> 
<p>Rank-and-file members of the panel who shuffled into the deposition room Monday morning for Maxwell's questioning included Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), who is running for governor, and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Il.), who is running for Senate.</p> 
<p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said he intended to view the unredacted Epstein files from the Justice Department on Monday afternoon. He also noted he would be joined by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), with whom Khanna led the effort to force a floor vote on the release of the files.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Capitol agenda: Republicans prepare DHS punt</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With fewer than five days to go before a DHS shutdown, Senate Democrats have put bill text for full-year funding on the table. But another punt is probably still the best-case scenario, and it’s by no means guaranteed.</p> 
<p><b>— What Democrats are pitching: </b>The draft legislation Democrats sent Republicans on Sunday would codify the immigration enforcement guardrails outlined by Democratic leaders last week, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss the plans. They include new judicial warrant requirements and limits on masking by federal agents.</p> 
<p><b>— Republicans review and prepare for CR: </b>While getting bill text is generally a good thing for the process, after Republicans complained publicly into the weekend about the lack of specifics from Democrats, it hasn’t changed the endgame for this week. Republicans and the White House view some of the ideas as possible areas for negotiation, but it’s just highly unlikely all sides agree to a full-year DHS revamp by Friday at midnight.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans expect to begin taking procedural steps Monday to set up consideration of a DHS funding patch. Senate aides still hope there’s a way to prevent a DHS shutdown, and progress on negotiations could dictate how easy it is to get bipartisan buy-in for another CR. Most Democrats will be reluctant to punt.</p> 
<p><b>— Shutdown still looks likely: </b>Unless the Senate does the unexpected and clears a new CR for DHS by Wednesday, there probably won’t be enough time for the House to follow suit before the shutdown deadline. House GOP leaders have no plans to cancel next week’s recess absent clearer proof of progress in the Senate, meaning a DHS shutdown could take even longer to resolve.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Ghislaine</b> <b>Maxwell deposition: </b>The House Oversight Committee<b>&nbsp;</b>will depose Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell virtually at 10 a.m. Monday. Maxwell is expected to invoke the Fifth Amendment and be uncooperative with questioning. House Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) will be reviewing unredacted Epstein files, according to a spokesperson. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) will review the files as well. </p> 
<p><b>— House moves on housing package: </b>The House is expected to swiftly pass a sweeping, bipartisan housing supply bill from the Financial Services Committee on Monday afternoon. After that, it’s unclear how the House and Senate will come together on one of the country’s most urgent cost-of-living problems.</p> 
<p>— <b>D.C. tax bill advances:</b> Senate Republicans are expected to act early this week to pass a measure that would force the District of Columbia to implement GOP tax cuts. The bill, which the House <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/04/congress/house-passes-measure-to-force-d-c-s-hand-on-tax-cuts-00766206" target="_blank">passed along party lines</a> last week, would block a November D.C. budget law that tossed aside tax provisions from last year’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.”</p>

<p>That would be the domain of Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51327" data-person-id="51327">Tom Cole</a>, the 76-year-old cigar-and-whiskey-loving chair of the House Appropriations Committee. Inside that haunt, the Oklahoman took an unabashedly old-school approach over the course of months to getting the congressional funding process unstuck after a record-long, 43-day shutdown last year.</p> 
<p>“That’s not actually an office — it’s a smoke room,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51132" data-person-id="51132">Darrell Issa</a> (R-Calif.), a regular in what some members cheekily call the “Cigar SCIF,” a play on the “sensitive compartmented information facilities” where government officials review state secrets.</p> 
<p>Inside, Cole “doesn't dazzle you with numbers, he works on people-to-people skills,” Issa said, “and it's the reason we've gotten something done.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/b1/96/c7135a594e80bc9e9230d6ae96e2/2026-0205-cole-francis-1-8-edit.jpg" alt="A cigar cutter and an ashtray are among the objects in Cole's office. “That’s not actually an office — it’s a smoke room,” said Rep.

<p>When Cole took the Appropriations gavel in the spring of 2024, conservative demands for spending reductions were mounting. Hard-liners citing unfulfilled promises of funding cuts had ousted Kevin McCarthy, a close Cole ally, from the speakership just six months earlier. Months later, Donald Trump was elected to a second term as president and immediately began freezing billions of dollars top appropriators had already fastidiously allocated.</p> 
<p>“We often joke: Boy, did we get here at a bad time,” Cole said in an interview, describing the situation he and Senate Appropriations Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51168" data-person-id="51168">Susan Collins</a> (R-Maine) confronted.</p> 
<p>While the politics of government spending grew stormy as 2025 wore on, Cole and his allies were biding their time and working — puff by puff and sip by sip — to build support for the government funding bills he was quietly negotiating with his counterparts across the aisle and across the Capitol.</p> 
<p>Matters came to a head in the weeks after the longest shutdown in U.S. history concluded in November. Fiscal conservatives in the House were threatening to block passage of the bills Cole had helped craft — demanding changes to legislation that had already been settled with Democrats.</p> 
<p>In early January, with tensions high and the chances for another lengthy shutdown rising, House Majority Whip <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227580" data-person-id="227580">Tom Emmer</a> (R-Minn.) entered Cole’s office off the House floor. He emerged more than an hour later and gave Cole his public blessing to proceed with what appropriators had negotiated, a key vote of confidence from the GOP leadership.</p> 
<p>“The bills are being built by the Appropriations Committee in the House and the Senate,” Emmer said. “Tom Cole and his colleagues on the Appropriations Committee are doing excellent work.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/3c/7a/116811954df7a794f2ac496361e0/ap25281549696252-edit.jpg" alt="Cole speaks as members of the House GOP leadership look on during a press conference on the 8th day of the government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol, on Oct. 8, 2025." data-portal-copyright="John McDonnell/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="25281549696252" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Cole speaks as members of the House GOP leadership look on during a press conference on the 8th day of the government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol, on Oct. 8, 2025."/><p>House hard-liners, who were eyeing massive cuts to member-requested earmarks, didn’t secure any further changes to the funding bills. Now eleven of the 12 annual measures have been signed into law, guaranteeing cash through September for every federal agency except the embattled Department of Homeland Security.</p> 
<p>Along the way Cole has won grudging respect from those same hard-liners, who give him credit for negotiating relatively flat overall funding levels and for trying to return the House to its traditional process of debating the 12 bills individually instead of as a catchall omnibus package.</p> 
<p>“Heavy is the head that wears the crown,” Republican Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/194221" data-person-id="194221">Scott Perry</a> said of Cole in an interview. "Of course he listens. He listens because he has to listen — we have votes.”</p> 
<p>Cole is “a big reason,” the Pennsylvania conservative continued, that the House is “crawling out of this hole of just ‘go along to get along’ in Washington, D.C.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium is-centered">‘Space is a great gift’</h5> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium is-centered"></h5> 
<p>While Freedom Caucus types like Perry tend not to be denizens of Cole’s tobacco-scented inner sanctum, a wide variety of members are often seen slipping in and out.</p> 
<p>Alongside top Republican appropriators like California Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51306" data-person-id="51306">Ken Calvert</a> are some GOP lawmakers who don’t sit on the spending panel, among them Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/385782" data-person-id="385782">Derrick Van Orden</a> of Wisconsin, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/240947" data-person-id="240947">Andrew Garbarino</a> of New York and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227109" data-person-id="227109">Don Bacon</a> of Nebraska. Some Democrats, including California Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259997" data-person-id="259997">Jimmy Panetta</a>, are known to drop in.</p> 
<p>“I've learned more in that room than anywhere else in Congress about how things operate,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/416993" data-person-id="416993">Mark Alford</a>, a second-term GOP congressman from Missouri who coined the “Cigar SCIF” moniker. “But it's just good to have a place to have honest conversations and develop friendships.”</p> 
<p>A grand photo of Cole’s great aunt, a famous Chickasaw storyteller known as Te Ata, is mounted beside a window overlooking the west front of the Capitol and the National Mall. Most days in winter, a fire burns in a black marble fireplace.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/c2/e0/0769d78947afbf2f202ef55d6691/2026-0205-cole-francis-1-1-edit.jpg" alt="A photo of Cole’s great aunt, a famous Chickasaw storyteller known as Te Ata, hangs in his office." data-portal-copyright="Francis Chung/POLITICO" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="A photo of Cole’s great aunt, a famous Chickasaw storyteller known as Te Ata, hangs in his office."/><p>“I think space is a great gift, and I think it's misused quite often,” Cole said. “These are grand settings. They're lovely rooms. They're obviously immediately adjacent to the floor. You can't have much better real estate than that.”</p> 
<p>Engraved on one chair is the name of Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51589" data-person-id="51589">Hal Rogers</a>, the longest-serving House member and a former Appropriations chair. The 88-year-old Kentucky Republican is often by Cole’s side during House votes and spends hours each week in the room off the floor, which Rogers said wasn’t used as “an open forum” until Cole got the gavel.</p> 
<p>When Nebraska GOP Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196030" data-person-id="196030">Mike Flood</a> — more than 25 years Cole’s junior — came to Capitol Hill in 2022, he sought Cole’s guidance on how to get on the Financial Services Committee. He got an invitation to another one of Cole’s smoke-filled offices — this one upstairs, next to the Rules Committee hearing room where Cole was then serving as chair — and received an education on Congress from Cole and “four other guys north of 75.”</p> 
<p>“The people who don't avail themselves of that have a much different experience in Congress,” Flood said in an interview, “because they're not learning the Congress as an institution, as a functioning way to make laws and govern Americans.”</p> 
<p>Cole likes to be regarded as an institutionalist and a “practical politician.” He holds a masters degree from Yale and a doctorate from the University of Oklahoma — both in British history — and is an avid reader of nonfiction accounts of war and politics. He was a member of the Oklahoma Senate in the 1980s, ran the National Republican Congressional Committee in the 1990s, served as Oklahoma secretary of state and then came to Congress in 2003.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/af/2f/075e66204444adb023d7c2e29a1c/ap23290603422057-edit.jpg" alt="Cole and Rep.

The 88-year-old Kentucky Republican is often by Cole’s side during House votes and spends hours each week in the room off the floor."/><p>“Experience, knowledge, temperament and persistence — he has it all in spades,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51356" data-person-id="51356">Mario Diaz-Balart</a> (R-Fla.), a senior appropriator and one of Cole’s closest friends. “The cigar does not hurt.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium is-centered">Beyond the House</h5> 
<p>Last March, Cole joined with House GOP leaders to halt bipartisan negotiations with Democrats and instead advanced a six-month funding patch — an audacious move that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/14/schumer-democrats-anger-shutdown-fight-00231908" target="_blank">spurred Democratic fury</a> and fueled the government shutdown this past fall.</p> 
<p>“The Democrats just didn't think we could do it,” Cole said. “I think that’s what made the 12 bills possible this year. They know we can do it. They know we will.”</p> 
<p>Even as Trump directly undermines Congress’ power to steer funding, Cole frequently praises the president in the first lines of any speech or statement celebrating a spending deal. He also was among the Republicans who voted Jan. 6, 2021, against certifying Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election, saying in a statement at the time that he did so “on behalf of my constituents."</p> 
<p>“I look on the administration as allies, not as enemies. But I also recognize that they can't just do what they want to do,” Cole said this year. “Anybody that thinks that Congress has somehow lost its power of the purse — it has not.”</p> 
<p>As Congress stares down another partial government shutdown over DHS funding, Cole is deferring to the White House in negotiations with Democrats who are demanding changes to the administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.</p> 
<p>“Clearly the decision is going to be made by the president on this,” he said.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/1e/cc/dc47ec364663997821eaa178085c/2026-0205-cole-francis-1-6-edit.jpg" alt="One of the windows in Cole's office overlooks the National Mall." data-portal-copyright="Francis Chung/POLITICO" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="One of the windows in Cole's office overlooks the National Mall."/><p>Cole also doesn’t meddle in the negotiations of his “cardinals,” the dozen lawmakers who chair his panel’s subcommittees, empowering each of them to resolve differences with Democrats on their own.</p> 
<p>“His word is gold,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151805" data-person-id="151805">Chuck Fleischmann</a> (R-Tenn.), one of those chairs. “He's infinitely fair, infinitely reasonable. He is so well attuned to working with people.”</p> 
<p>Cole instead focuses on negotiating overall totals and tricky policy disputes with Congress’ other three top appropriators: Collins, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51351" data-person-id="51351">Rosa DeLauro</a> (D-Conn.) and Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51219" data-person-id="51219">Patty Murray</a> (D-Wash.).</p> 
<p>None of those women smoke cigars, and they prefer to meet in Collins’ less-odorous office on the Senate side. But they all have a close relationship with Cole.</p> 
<p>Murray and Cole go back years: They faced off in negotiations over health, education and labor funding as subcommittee chairs during Paul Ryan’s speakership. Cole described the Washington Democrat as “a candid politician” who is “steely in her resolve” but “wants to get to a deal.”</p> 
<p>Cole said Collins reminds him of his mother, who was the first Native American woman to serve in the Oklahoma Senate. “Her political skills are formidable,” he said, and “she's a hard person not to like.”</p> 
<p>As for his Democratic counterpart in the House, Cole calls DeLauro one of his “favorite people in Congress” and describes her as “an Italian grandmother.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/0f/fa/4e0f1d404716ac3d93823418f413/ap26021711285961-edit.jpg" alt="Cole and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) greet each other as they prepare to testify before the House Appropriations Committee at the U.S. Capitol, on Jan. 21, 2026." data-portal-copyright="Francis Chung/POLITICO" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="26021711285961" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Cole and Rep.

<p>That relationship was built not only through years of hard-nosed negotiations but also gentler moments like a 2024 Middle East trip the pair took as part of a bipartisan delegation of appropriators.</p> 
<p>“I’m going to drink all the bourbon with you that I can,” she recalled telling him. “On the other hand, I’m not smoking any cigars.”</p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the year of a congressional delegation trip to the Middle East. It was in 2024.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/177013" data-person-id="177013">Mark Amodei</a> (R-Nev.), the top Republican on the DHS appropriations subcommittee, will not seek reelection to the House this year, he announced Friday.</p> 
<p>The eight-term lawmaker is just the latest high-profile Republican to announce plans to retire from Congress in an increasingly murky midterm environment for the GOP.</p> 
<p>“I came to Congress to solve problems and to make sure our State and Nation have strong voice in the federal policy and oversight processes,” <a href="https://amodei.house.gov/news-releases/amodei-announces-retirement" target="_blank">he said in a statement</a>. “I look forward to finishing my term.”</p> 
<p>Amodei’s 2nd District is Republican-leaning and would likely remain in GOP hands even in a tough year for the party overall. He’s the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation.</p> 
<p>Amodei’s decision comes just three months after President Donald Trump blessed him with a “Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-election” in November. At the time, it appeared he would run again.</p> 
<p>“Thank you Mr. President @realDonaldTrump!” <a href="https://x.com/AmodeiForNevada/status/1985448520665489444" target="_blank">Amodei wrote in response</a>.</p> 
<p>Just over a week ago, Amodei became the rare Republican to publicly push back against elements of the president’s agenda, when he called for a “pivot” in <a href="https://amodei.house.gov/news-releases/amodeis-statement-homeland-security-developments-minnesota" target="_blank">ICE’s core mission in Minnesota</a>. He also <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/14/congress/house-gop-offer-to-dems-explicit-funding-for-ice-body-cameras-following-minneapolis-shooting-pro-00729265" target="_blank">led a DHS funding bill with explicit funding</a> for body cameras to be worn by ICE officials and additional deescalation training for DHS officers.</p> 
<p>Amodei has also worked to curtail DHS’ ability to move congressionally appropriated money in this year’s funding bill for the agency, a move he in January <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/06/congress/dhs-reprogramming-crackdown-00713569" target="_blank">conceded could be unpopular with White House officials</a>, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p> 
<p>But <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/dhs-funding-deal-shutdown-00763718" target="_blank">momentum toward a federal funding deal for DHS has stalled</a> due to the chaos in Minnesota, and Congress has just days to avert a shutdown affecting the agency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House is set to vote next week on a once-obscure elections bill that has now become a household name among hard-right activists and a major rallying point for an otherwise divided GOP.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7296" target="_blank">SAVE America Act</a>, aimed at tightening voter registration standards, has a difficult path to enactment despite a no-holds-barred pressure campaign from the likes of President Donald Trump and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/elon-musk-gop-comeback-00751572" target="_blank">tech mogul Elon Musk</a>. Democrats are certain to filibuster the bill in the Senate, and it’s unlikely the GOP is ready to take extraordinary steps to overcome that hurdle.</p> 
<p>But amid growing fears that their party is not doing enough to address Americans’ key concerns — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/republicans-affordability-congress-00679545" target="_blank">rising prices chief among them</a> — House GOP leaders and key senators have chosen to put the election security push at the center of their agenda.</p> 
<p>The issue almost tanked a massive government funding package this week and threatened to extend a four-day partial government shutdown — until Trump intervened and ordered House Republicans to pass the bill without attaching the elections legislation.</p> 
<p>But the issue is not going away. Besides the House action next week — the chamber’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2025/04/14/the-house-passed-the-save-act-what-comes-next-00288458" target="_blank">second vote on a version of the legislation</a> in less than a year — there is a mounting campaign on GOP senators to find ways around Democratic opposition and get the bill to Trump’s desk.</p> 
<p>Trump is personally involved in the effort. Majority Leader Steve Scalise spoke with the president about the bill at a Jan. 29 White House meeting, and GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/05/congress/gop-senators-meet-with-trump-on-save-act-00767525" target="_blank">met with Trump to discuss it</a> Thursday afternoon.</p> 
<p>Scalise said in an interview that Trump “wants to find the best place to get it passed so it can get signed into law” and Republican leaders are “in the process of working with the president to get the best path forward.”</p> 
<p>The legislation would <a href="https://roy.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-roy-senator-lee-launch-save-america-act-renewed-push-election-integrity" target="_blank">trigger major changes</a> to how Americans vote, including requiring would-be voters to present proof of citizenship to register, eliminating mail-only registrations, and requiring photo ID in every state for the first time. It would also require states to take new steps to remove noncitizens from existing voter rolls.</p> 
<p>The push for the bill has taken flight among GOP hard-liners, who won a private promise from Speaker Mike Johnson to schedule the upcoming vote, according to four people granted anonymity to describe the conversations, in lieu of attaching the election bill to the larger spending package and threatening its ability to clear the Senate.</p> 
<p>White House deputy chief of staff James Blair this week also wrangled House GOP holdouts upset over the lack of action on the elections bill. The top Trump political aide worked to salvage the funding package in a series of phone calls in the final minutes <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/congress-ends-shutdown-00762482" target="_blank">before it was ultimately passed</a>, according to three people with direct knowledge of the conversations.</p> 
<p>Democrats and voting-access advocates have attacked the legislation as likely to disenfranchise huge swaths of legitimate voters in a misguided effort to address an alleged epidemic of noncitizen voting that they say does not exist.</p> 
<p>“If you’re one of the tens of millions of U.S. citizens who does not have access to your birth certificate, or if you’re one of the 50 percent of Americans who don’t have a passport, the SAVE Act could make it impossible for you to participate in elections,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said this week.</p> 
<p>But the bill is in keeping with Trump’s longstanding belief, unsupported by evidence, that elections in many states are “rigged” in favor of Democrats and that strong federal action is needed to rectify it. He said in an interview this week that Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/02/trump-nationalize-elections-2026-midterms-00760015" target="_blank">should seek to “nationalize” elections</a>.</p> 
<p>Addressing House Republicans at a policy retreat last month, Trump told them they “ought to pass” the SAVE America Act, formerly known as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act.</p> 
<p>“Our elections are crooked as hell, and you can win — not only win elections over that and not only win future elections, but you'll win every debate because the public is really angry about it,” he said.</p> 
<p>He reiterated the message in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116020521328279296" target="_blank">Truth Social post</a> Thursday, published after his meeting with the three senators: “We are either going to fix [America’s elections], or we won’t have a Country any longer.”</p> 
<p>The House is expected to vote on a procedural measure Tuesday paving the final floor action later in the week. What happens in the Senate after that is less clear.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has pledged to call the bill up for a vote at some point in the coming months, but under normal circumstances Democrats could block it from proceeding.</p> 
<p>Yet rank-and-file House Republicans and some GOP senators are pushing for a breakthrough, urging Thune to require a “talking filibuster” or “standing filibuster” that would eventually, they believe, force Democrats to relent. The change would force senators to be present and speaking on the Senate floor to block legislation, as opposed to the current practice of requiring 60 votes to end debate and move to the final passage of most bills.</p> 
<p>But Thune has treaded carefully around any suggestion that the 60-vote rule should be diluted. Many Republican senators want to see the supermajority threshold start in place, and Thune <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/03/congress/thune-filibuster-deal-luna-00761867" target="_blank">dismissed claims from some House Republicans</a> this week that he had agreed to pursue the talking filibuster route. He said he would only agree to discuss the matter with his conference.</p> 
<p>With the Senate still working through how to pass long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, that internal conversation has yet to take place. Some senators are privately and publicly warning the push could tie up the Senate floor for weeks or months, blocking other GOP priorities.</p> 
<p>Some hard-line Republicans are floating a trial run, using the talking filibuster to try to pass a DHS funding stopgap, according to three people granted anonymity to describe the private discussions.</p> 
<p>“I would just remind people that the coin of the realm in the Senate is floor time, and we have a lot of things we have to do,” Thune told reporters. “Triggering a talking filibuster has implications and ramifications that I think everybody needs to be aware of. So we will have those discussions.”</p> 
<p>In a sign that Republicans are looking at this as more than a political messaging exercise, the bill’s proponents say they are addressing some of the criticisms of the bill — including that it could effectively bar members of the U.S. military stationed abroad from voting.</p> 
<p>Co-author Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said there are exceptions in the bill that would address the military and other concerns but allow only “true absentee ballots.” He said he was otherwise focused on pushing the other chamber to sidestep Democrats and send the bill to Trump.</p> 
<p>“They get on the Senate floor, they can call the question, if there are people willing to speak … there'll be drama, and then we'll see what happens,” Roy said. “We'll see who wins, but that's what we're supposed to do.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s independent watchdog disclosed numerous investigations into the department on Thursday as the White House faces heightened scrutiny over its nationwide immigration crackdown.</p> 
<p>The probes, some of which have previously been disclosed, span ICE’s hiring surge, expedited removal of individuals, use of force and compliance with detention standards. An additional review pertains to “DHS’ processes for determining U.S. citizenship for individuals detained or arrested during immigration enforcement operations.”</p> 
<p>The inspector general’s office is also conducting a probe into Customs and Border Patrol. The investigation — which is reviewing whether CBP conducts interior immigration enforcement in accordance with department policies and federal requirements — was opened in early January, according to a spokesperson for the DHS OIG.</p> 
<p>The spate of investigations comes as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/05/noems-problems-go-beyond-the-ice-shootings-in-minneapolis-00767750" target="_blank">faces an uproar</a> from Democrats and a growing number of Republicans over its immigration enforcement operations in several states, which have at times turned violent. Senate Democrats are currently <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/05/congress/dhs-negotiations-thune-shutdown-00767076" target="_blank">holding up DHS funding</a> over a list of demands for reforms to ICE and CBP, including requirements that federal officers wear body cameras and IDs. The administration has also refused to budge on a demand that immigration enforcement agents do not wear masks.</p> 
<p>DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin dismissed the probes, writing in a statement that "the supposed number of ongoing matters doesn’t say anything about their disposition or the facts."</p> 
<p>“DHS’s job is to secure the homeland, and we do so in line with federal law and the Constitution," she said. "The Trump administration is committed to transparency, and we have no problem with honest and impartial oversight.”</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/donald-trump-inspectors-general-firing-00200611" target="_blank">purged independent watchdogs</a> for several government agencies during the first month of his second term, but Joseph Cuffari — the inspector general for DHS nominated by Trump during his first term — remains in place.</p> 
<p>Dozens of congressional Democrats wrote last week to Cuffari <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/dhs-investigation-use-of-force-ice-00761953" target="_blank">urging him to expedite his probe</a> into “whether ICE investigates allegations of use of excessive force,” which his office opened in June.</p> 
<p>In a Thursday statement, Cuffari’s office said the timeline for conducting an oversight review “is affected by several variables.” The office has an internal goal of completing audits within 397 days but routinely misses the benchmark, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-26-107341.pdf" target="_blank">according to a report</a> released by the Government Accountability Office last month.</p> 
<p>“If, however, during our work we find matters that warrant immediate attention and action (such as those posing serious risk or imminent threat to safety, health, property, or continuity of operations), DHS OIG has mechanisms to promptly inform the Department and Congress, rather than waiting for a final report,” the office said.</p> 
<p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have also <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/26/congress/krist-noem-democrats-00746865" target="_blank">called for the removal</a> of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in recent weeks, although <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/democratic-house-leaders-kristi-noem-impeachment-00749643" target="_blank">an impeachment resolution</a> is unlikely to garner sufficient bipartisan support in the House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leaders of two Republican-led committees are quietly locked in a behind-the-scenes turf battle.</p> 
<p>Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who helms the Senate Banking Committee, <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-2f52-d647-addc-afd747a70000" target="_blank"><u>sent a letter</u></a> this week to Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the chair and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary panel, saying he was “surprised” to learn that Judiciary had convened a hearing on the history of Credit Suisse’s servicing of Nazi-linked bank accounts.</p> 
<p>“While this subject matter is of historic importance, its connection to the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction is less clear,” Scott wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.</p> 
<p>In his opening statement at the Judiciary hearing earlier this week, Grassley said the proceedings were designed to provide an “interim investigative update” on the probe he launched in the previous Congress with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) when the two men served as the ranking member and chair of the Budget Committee.</p> 
<p>But Scott, in his letter, said that Senate rules gave the Banking Committee jurisdiction over banks, banking and financial institutions — and “the rules do not provide an exception to this exclusive jurisdiction for morally grave topics.” </p> 
<p>“The subject matter of this hearing should therefore fall under the Banking Committee's oversight because the Banking Committee has the expertise, jurisdiction, and institutional responsibility to investigate these kinds of banking matters,” he added.</p> 
<p>It’s not the first time the two committees have clashed, according to the letter: Scott recalled receiving a note from the Judiciary Committee last month when the Banking Committee took up legislation on which Judiciary believed it should have been consulted.</p> 
<p>Now, Scott contended, the Judiciary Committee is revisiting previous work by the Banking Committee that “could provide benefits to banking regulation and bring additional accountability to banks” — but it had to be done in consultation with Banking.</p> 
<p>Scott is asking Grassley and Durbin to hand over a swath of information, including records related to U.S. banks and details on any future hearings on the subject, by Feb. 25.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Grassley declined to comment on the letter. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Republicans are weighing whether to bow out of a major international gathering next week as GOP leaders press them to stay in Washington and hammer out a Homeland Security Department funding deal.</p> 
<p>This year’s Munich Security Conference — a marquee transatlantic gathering that begins Feb. 13 — has taken on new urgency in the wake of President Donald Trump’s threats to invade Greenland, a Danish territory, and tariff core NATO allies over the dispute. Trump backed down, but dozens of lawmakers planned to go in order to shore up ties and reaffirm America’s commitment to NATO.</p> 
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a Munich mainstay and Trump ally, said Thursday he won’t attend unless a DHS deal is reached. The department is on a short-term stopgap funding measure while Democrats are demanding new limits and oversight on Immigration and Customs Enforcement practices, which Republicans say would undercut security.</p> 
<p>“The reason we go to these places is to have an American voice, and if we can't get our act together here, a lot of people are wondering what we're going to do about Russia,” he said. “People say if you want to be safe at home you have to engage the world, and I agree.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another regular at the conference, told reporters his decision to go would hinge on the status of cross-party negotiations.</p> 
<p>“Game day decision,” said Tillis, the top Republican on the Senate’s NATO Observer Group. “It's gonna be based on how well we're working and if the Democrats are being reasonable. That’s one thing, and if they’re not, it’s another thing.”</p> 
<p>Not all Republicans are on the fence. Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said he is going to the Munich Security Conference again this year and doesn't anticipate the threat of a DHS shutdown derailing his trip, which includes Italy’s defense ministry and the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe’s parliamentary assembly in Vienna.</p> 
<p>A spending deal that became law this week gives lawmakers until next Friday to negotiate a Homeland Security funding package. But funding will lapse if Republicans and Democrats can’t forge a deal by next weekend or don’t pass another stopgap.</p> 
<p>Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that it's a “serious question” whether senators should suspend their travel — including to Munich — until the impasse ends. </p> 
<p>“If we get to the end of next week and we're in a shutdown posture, I think that the idea of people going on trips, no matter how justified or well-intended they are, it seems like that ought to be a non-starter,” he said.</p> 
<p>Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, the top Democrat on the panel that controls defense funding, argued lawmakers from both parties should attend the international conference despite the funding standoff to shore up the transatlantic alliance. Trump’s Greenland pressure campaign “profoundly undermined” European confidence in the U.S., he said.</p> 
<p>"We have a genuine problem in our transatlantic relationship," Coons told reporters. "And to cancel sending a large delegation to Munich simply so that we can figure out how to actually do policing in a democracy sends exactly the wrong message."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lindsey Graham says Johnson is open to expanding Smith probe payouts</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is pitching fellow Republicans on expanding who can sue over the now-defunct Jack Smith investigation — and Graham claims he has a key supporter in Speaker Mike Johnson.</p> 
<p>Graham said in a statement to POLITICO that he had spoken with Johnson about his push to allow lawsuits from people he claims were improperly targeted by the former special counsel during his probe of the 2020 election. Johnson, he said, is amenable to expanding who can sue beyond just the handful of GOP senators who had their phone records seized.</p> 
<p>“I had a very good conversation with Speaker Johnson who does, in my view, want to open the courthouse doors to people wronged and hold Jack Smith accountable,” Graham said. “He wants to expand the ability to sue to more people, not less, consistent with congressional ethics rules. I share that view.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>The interchamber communication is the latest turn in a monthslong saga over <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/john-thune-government-funding-phone-records-seizure-00646094" target="_blank">letting Graham and other senators sue the Justice Department</a> for potentially millions of dollars over Smith’s decision to subpoena their phone records.</p> 
<p>The provision was tucked into a spending bill enacted in November, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/13/senate-republicans-phones-sue-jack-smith-00651463" target="_blank">prompting an uproar from Democrats and House Republicans</a> who saw it as a case of secret self-dealing. The House in turn moved last month to insert its own provision in a separate spending bill undoing the effort — prompting the South Carolina Republican to lash out at the speaker during a floor speech last week.</p> 
<p>Graham briefly held up the spending bill but won a commitment from Senate Majority Leader John Thune for a separate vote on an expanded provision that would allow not only senators to sue, but also other members of Congress, groups and individuals.</p> 
<p>“We’re going to give everyone in the South Carolina delegation the chance to open the courthouse doors to conservatives who were targeted by Jack Smith and the Biden DOJ,” Graham said Thursday.</p> 
<p>At the same time, Graham has sought to emphasize that his legislation is not aimed at self-enrichment, claiming to reporters last week that the Senate Ethics Committee confirmed he could not personally profit.</p> 
<p>The Ethics Committee guidance, which was reviewed by POLITICO, holds that senators are not entitled to receive monetary compensation under the original provision enacted in November but can seek a declaratory judgment and/or injunctive relief. Graham’s forthcoming legislation, his office said, will follow the committee guidelines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday left open the possibility the administration could sue President Donald Trump’s pick for Federal Reserve chair, Kevin Warsh, if he doesn’t deliver on the president’s desired interest rate cuts.</p> 
<p>Trump said Saturday he would consider suing Warsh if he did not cut interest rates. The Fed is an independent agency.</p> 
<p>When asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during a Senate Banking Committee hearing about the possibility of a lawsuit, Bessent refused to answer.</p> 
<p>“That is up to the president,” he said, before adding: “Warsh is highly qualified.”</p> 
<p>The Trump administration, including Bessent, has been sharply critical of the Fed and its current Chair Jerome Powell for its interest rate policy and its handling of a building renovation. The <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/04/congress/scott-powell-doj-probe-00764230" target="_blank">Department of Justice is investigating</a> Powell in relation to the renovation, moves Powell has called “pretexts.”</p> 
<p>Bessent furthered that criticism Thursday, saying Treasury cannot print “magic money” to solve some of the nation’s economic issues — referring to the Fed’s ability to expand the amount of money in circulation, a power both Bessent and Warsh say has been overused.</p> 
<p>The comments echo remarks Bessent made in a fiery <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/02/bessent-outlines-deregulation-priorities-to-lawmakers-00764130" target="_blank">House hearing</a> Wednesday. “The Fed has lost accountability,” he said. “It lost the trust of the American people when it allowed the greatest inflation in 49 years.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who has said he will <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/03/congress/powell-pardon-tillis-blockade-00763054" target="_blank">not vote</a> for Warsh until the Powell probe is resolved, said senators had already heard from Powell about the cost overruns.</p> 
<p>“[Powell] was testifying and we didn’t see a crime,” he said.</p> 
<p>There were multiple moments of tension between the Treasury secretary and Democratic senators Thursday, similar to Wednesday’s at-times rocky House meeting.</p> 
<p>Bessent took shots at Warren, with whom he has feuded publicly in the past. When she asked why he had previously written that tariffs would be inflationary — an economic effect he and the administration argue is not at play today — he answered that he is not always right.</p> 
<p>“A year before [writing that letter to investors], I also wrote that I thought Senator Warren would be the Democratic presidential nominee. So my predictions have been bad,” he said.</p> 
<p>In one line of questioning from multiple senators, Bessent was asked how he, as acting director of the Internal Revenue Service, would handle the president’s $10 billion dollar lawsuit against the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/trump-sues-irs-leaked-tax-returns-00756718" target="_blank">tax agency</a>, filed last week.</p> 
<p>“It’s a Justice department matter,” he said. “I will follow the law.” He acknowledged that if the president were to be successful, the funds would come out of the Treasury General Account, the checking account of the government that he oversees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With eight days to avert a Department of Homeland Security shutdown, serious negotiations have yet to begin, Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> said Thursday.</p> 
<p>The South Dakota Republican said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/6774" data-person-id="6774">Katie Britt</a> (R-Ala.), who is leading the talks for Republicans, has reached out to Democrats for a sitdown but has gotten “crickets” so far in response.</p> 
<p>Britt <a href="https://x.com/SenKatieBritt/status/2019269903488823471" target="_blank">publicly slammed</a> a Democratic offer released Wednesday night as a “a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” while Thune also pooh-poohed <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-2c02-d647-addc-afc7b33a0000" target="_blank">the proposal</a> from Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> and House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a>.</p> 
<p>“There are a few things that there’s probably some room to negotiate on,” Thune said about the 10-item list. “But a lot of that stuff obviously just wasn’t serious.”</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51493" data-person-id="51493">Chris Murphy</a> of Connecticut, who is the top Democrat on the Appropriations subpanel overseeing DHS that Britt chairs, said Thursday, “I don't think that's accurate” when asked about claims that Democrats were not willing to sit down. Britt was also spotted talking Thursday afternoon with Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/201768" data-person-id="201768">Brian Schatz</a> (D-Hawaii), a frequent leadership go-between. </p> 
<p>Thune is waiting to see if the talks shake loose by Thursday afternoon, when senators will leave Washington for the week. He warned he is ready to start moving Monday to pass another DHS stopgap bill ahead of the Feb. 13 deadline.</p> 
<p>“If they refuse to sit down and actually come to the table and negotiate, pretty clearly we’ll need one,” Thune said.</p> 
<p>Republicans haven’t decided how long that stopgap should be. Thune has floated a two- or three-week patch if negotiations are ongoing but is also warning Congress could shift to long-term continuing resolution, keeping current funding levels in place through September, if talks don’t progress.</p> 
<p>He said Thursday that the length of the stopgap would depend on what Democrats would accept since their votes will be needed to advance another patch through the Senate. Many House and Senate Democrats have vowed not to support another CR, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2026/02/05/the-dems-not-opposed-to-another-dhs-punt-00766667" target="_blank">though a crucial swath</a> of senators have left the door open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sizable number of Senate Democrats haven’t ruled out another short-term funding punt for the Department of Homeland Security.</p> 
<p>Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer sent a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-2c02-d647-addc-afc7b33a0000" target="_blank">formal wishlist of DHS policy changes</a> Wednesday to GOP leaders Mike Johnson and John Thune. But Republicans <a href="https://x.com/SenKatieBritt/status/2019269903488823471?s=20" target="_blank">have little interest</a> in their ideas, with leaders hinting at the need for another continuing resolution to buy more time for talks.</p> 
<p><b>— Dodging the question: </b>“We need to keep as many options on the table as possible,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told reporters when asked whether she would rule out a CR.</p> 
<p>Shaheen was one of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/09/senate-democrats-shutdown-vote-00644146" target="_blank">eight Senate Democrats</a> who voted to help Republicans end the record government shutdown last fall. Some other senators in that group also didn’t give direct answers Wednesday on whether they’d support a second DHS stopgap — a stark contrast to many fellow Democrats, who immediately rejected the idea.</p> 
<p>Most of the eight Democrats instead noted there’s more than a week before the funding cliff arrives.</p> 
<p>“As soon as you say [another CR], you can bet it’ll take another two, three weeks to reach a conclusion,” Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, told Calen. “We can fix this problem. We’ve got enough time to do it by the 13th of this month.”</p> 
<p>“We’re going to give [Republicans] a proposal and they should say yes to it,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told POLITICO. Asked if he’d help move another funding patch if Republicans object to their pitches, Kaine said, “I won’t say past that.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) also did not respond directly to questions about whether she’d support another DHS CR.</p> 
<p><b>— The brewing CR length fight:</b> Another stopgap to buy time for more talks is one thing; a full-year CR like what Thune is floating is another.</p> 
<p>Democrats want to force the White House and Republicans into a deal in the next few days. They are opposed to a yearlong measure that would keep the status quo at DHS and allow the administration more leeway in how it uses money for ICE and Customs and Border Protection.</p> 
<p>Some Democrats who plan to attend Thursday morning’s National Prayer Breakfast are hoping to talk directly with President Donald Trump about his immigration agenda and the recent killings of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents.</p> 
<p>Thune is open to another two-week measure, but said “it may be the best way to deal with this particular appropriations bill is do a yearlong CR, if that’s what it takes.” Keep an eye on whether the majority leader starts laying the procedural groundwork for a CR before the Senate adjourns Thursday.</p> 
<p>While Johnson is “optimistic” there will be a DHS deal, he told POLITICO he was “neither ruling it in or out” when it comes to a short-term CR.</p> 
<p>“I don’t make any projections on that,” Johnson added about the possibility of a full-year CR for DHS.</p>

      <description>Rep. Jay Obernolte’s compromise approach to AI regulation is seen by many in the tech industry as their best hope to block state AI laws. But do GOP leaders want what he’s selling?</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech companies desperately want Congress to pass a federal law this year blocking state rules on artificial intelligence, and many think their best shot lies with California Republican Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/76dc3dbe-83e3-41e1-875c-58c75270e9b0" target="_blank">Jay Obernolte</a>, a former computer engineer now serving his third term in the House.</p> 
<p>There’s just one problem: House GOP leaders don’t appear to be listening to him.</p> 
<p>AI industry lobbyists have been pushing Capitol Hill for months to pass a bill that would preempt the ability of states to enact AI laws, arguing it would stop a patchwork of conflicting state rules from impeding innovation.</p> 
<p>Many see Obernolte, who co-chaired a bipartisan AI task force last Congress and has deep relationships across the aisle, as their greatest hope for action before the end of the year. They say his technical acumen and consensus-building approach on AI will be key to clinching an agreement with Democrats, necessary in a politically polarized Washington.</p> 
<p>“If there is anyone in the House who can run point and cobble together the pieces on what meaningful federal AI standards and an AI package could look like, it's Jay Obernolte,” said Tony Samp, principal AI adviser at lobbying firm DLA Piper, in an interview.</p> 
<p>Obernolte is currently <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/09/obernolte-prepping-his-own-ai-legislation-as-cruz-moves-00561579" target="_blank">working on an AI bill</a> that could pair preemption of state AI laws with a framework to regulate the technology, including new research infrastructure and safety checks on advanced AI models — a compromise that senior AI lobbyists now support after Hill Republicans failed twice last year to unilaterally block state AI regulations.</p> 
<p>“You need to codify the federal regulatory framework for AI and, if you don’t do that … essentially you’re saying that there’s no regulation,” said Obernolte in a recent interview. “And I don’t blame people for being uncomfortable with that.”</p> 
<p>But four senior tech industry representatives who want a deal, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive legislative talks, said Obernolte’s influence has so far been stifled by GOP leadership, and that he’s been largely absent from high-level Hill negotiations over the future of AI policy.</p> 
<p>It’s a sign, they said, that Republican leaders may not be serious about reaching an AI compromise, despite President Donald Trump’s recent call for Congress to come up with a solution to thwart states from freelancing. Both the tech industry representatives and some Democrats instead worry that GOP leaders are refusing to budge on their stance that there should be minimal regulation of the technology — a position shared by some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/20/big-tech-gets-worried-about-trumps-ai-czar-00701112" target="_blank">venture capitalists and White House officials</a>.</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders publicly insist they’re on the same page with Obernolte and share his goal of drafting consensus legislation that would preempt state AI laws, even as they have so far failed to embrace his ideas and, in fact, appear determined to pursue other tracks.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for House Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/9254ce9b-038e-47a5-aab0-17cd3173dc0a" target="_blank">Steve Scalise</a> said that while the Louisiana Republican supports a relatively hands-off approach to AI regulation, “preempting a patchwork of countless varying state laws does not mean no guardrails.”</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, Scalise recently expressed skepticism towards any regulations on the sector — a stance that could make a political compromise on AI harder to achieve.</p> 
<p>“A lot of these people that want to limit and regulate any industry, a lot of times, what they’re really trying to do is make it hard to do those things in America,” Scalise told reporters in early January. “We should maintain that edge, and we do it by innovating — not by regulating.”</p> 
<p>The four tech representatives said they’ve so far seen little to suggest that leadership is interested in Obernolte’s plan for an AI accord. They said he should have been brought into the preemption effort last year, after Senate Commerce Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/9c10f49c-c99d-46b3-854b-28db18856420" target="_blank">Ted Cruz</a> (R-Texas) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/02/ai-regulation-trump-allies-state-powers-00428337" target="_blank">fell short in his efforts</a> to insert a ban on state AI rules into the GOP’s tax and spending megabill.</p> 
<p>They also said Obernolte’s absence from last fall’s unsuccessful push by House leadership to insert a similar provision into the year-end defense bill was unfortunate, largely because it made a compromise tougher to achieve.</p> 
<p>“It was a little surprising that one of their best players wasn't even in the game during the latest push for federal AI standards,” said Samp.</p> 
<p>Connor Chapinski, Obernolte’s communications director, downplayed the characterization that Obernolte is being kept away from the GOP’s high-level AI strategy. In a statement, he said Obernolte remains fully engaged with his leadership and the Trump administration around crafting “thoughtful legislation.”</p> 
<p>Athina Lawson, a spokesperson for Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/575304ca-80a9-49bb-817e-4215621a1682" target="_blank">Mike Johnson</a>, in a statement credited Obernolte’s chairmanship of the task force with giving members “a clearer understanding of how to responsibly leverage the opportunities of artificial intelligence.” She said GOP leadership is coordinating with the Trump administration on AI and plans to “work through committees of jurisdiction to build consensus” among Republicans.</p> 
<p>The task force’s <a href="https://obernolte.house.gov/AITFReport" target="_blank">255-page report</a> — released by Obernolte and fellow California Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/aac1bf52-a187-494e-afd6-d86f9cd0be6c" target="_blank">Ted Lieu</a>, a Democrat, in December 2024 — laid out a slew of findings and policy recommendations related to AI. Yet despite some interest from the tech industry, the panel was not renewed by GOP leadership and its recommendations have gone virtually unheeded.</p> 
<p>One senior GOP aide who works on AI policy, granted anonymity to discuss internal GOP strategy, said the report was produced under former President Joe Biden and was “somewhat outdated now that we have a new administration, a new dynamic in Congress.”</p> 
<p>A senior Democratic aide who was closely involved with the task force, also granted anonymity to speak candidly, said it has become clear over a period of time that “Mr. Obernolte, for better or worse, had been sort of sidelined … He was like their lead guy on AI, put in a corner.”</p> 
<p>Some Democrats are now looking to exploit what they perceive as a leadership gap on AI policy on the other side of the aisle. Lieu now co-chairs a new House Democratic Commission on AI, convened by House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/196306" target="_blank">Hakeem Jeffries</a> (N.Y.) and co-chaired by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/1e33558b-6bee-4149-b50c-db990e1c6305" target="_blank">Josh Gottheimer</a> (N.J.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/5479cb8d-0608-4a9b-967c-538cd92946f4" target="_blank">Valerie Foushee</a> (N.C.). In the absence of bipartisan action, they plan to formulate their own plan for regulating the fast-moving technology.</p> 
<p>“The White House has led the industry astray, down a bad path,” Lieu said in an interview. “Steve Scalise is very opposed to any kind of legislation at the federal level. … And that’s now resulted in three things the tech industry wanted to avoid, which is, backlash from the public, backlash from bipartisan members of Congress and multiple states regulating their industry.”</p> 
<p>Gottheimer, in a recent interview, said, “I think Republicans have certainly ceded the turf.”</p> 
<p>There are signs that GOP leaders are starting to feel pressure to legislate on AI. Ohio Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/191ff88b-badc-4f7e-b8c8-e47d200f0aab" target="_blank">Jim Jordan</a> — chair of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over AI issues like privacy, surveillance and intellectual property — suggested in a Monday interview that “I don’t know about moving anything, but we’re definitely talking about AI.”</p> 
<p>Jordan added that one of his staffers had just informed him that his panel should ramp up those discussions.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk announced he will not run for reelection this year, the latest Republican to retire amid what’s shaping up to be a tough midterm for Republicans.</p> 
<p>Loudermilk, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, said in a statement he’s retiring to “spend more dedicated time with my family.”</p> 
<p>“Although I continue to have strong support from the people of the Eleventh Congressional District, I believe it is time to contribute to my community, state, and nation in other ways,” he said in the statement.</p> 
<p>Loudermilk’s retirement comes as his select subcommittee reinvestigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol ramps up its probe. </p> 
<p>The panel — which was launched as a response to the probe helmed by Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and now-former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) in the year after the attack — held its first hearings last month, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/04/congress/jan-6-committee-subpoenas-t-mobile-for-records-relating-to-alleged-pipe-bomb-perpetrator-00764604" target="_blank">subpoenaed for phone records</a> in connection to the suspect accused of placing pipe bombs outside Republican and Democratic headquarters prior to the riot.</p> 
<p>Republicans will expect to retain Loudermilk’s seat in suburban Atlanta in November, which he won by 34 points in 2024. </p> 
<p>But the announcement marks the latest member of the House Republican caucus to leave Congress this cycle. Since the beginning of 2025, <a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/casualty-list" target="_blank">33 other House Republicans</a> have resigned, announced their retirements or launched campaigns seeking other elected office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer is considering calling Bill Gates to testify in his ongoing Jeffrey Epstein investigation, saying in an interview Wednesday a bipartisan group of lawmakers on the panel are pressing for a chance to question the billionaire Microsoft founder.</p> 
<p>“We're certainly looking at that, so we'll have more to come on that,” said the Kentucky Republican, adding that he’s been “approached by multiple Republicans and Democrats on the committee that would like to ask Bill Gates questions, so odds are.”</p> 
<p>Comer said he also wants to review an interview from Gates’ ex-wife, Melinda Gates, which will air on NPR Thursday, to see if she divulges any more information about her former husband and the extent of his possible involvement with Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.</p> 
<p>Bill Gates was depicted in the release of Epstein-related materials <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/bill-gates-appears-in-newly-released-photos-from-epstein-estate-00688695" target="_blank">in December</a> but has come under renewed security over his ties to the disgraced financier in the latest set of documents to be made public.</p> 
<p>The newest tranche of files includes allegations that Gates contracted a sexually transmitted disease from women in Epstein’s orbit. A spokesperson for Gates has called the allegations absurd.</p> 
<p>Gates has said he had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/bill-gates-appears-in-newly-released-photos-from-epstein-estate-00688695" target="_blank">several dinners</a> with Epstein based on an understanding that Epstein would use his wealthy connections to fundraise for global health causes. When that didn’t happen, Gates told PBS NewsHour in 2021, he cut off the dinners, calling the meetings “a mistake.”</p> 
<p>Comer has already issued subpoenas for other individuals known to have had some ties to Epstein, or mentioned in the Epstein files, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Negotiations with the former president and secretary of State over the terms of their testimonies dragged on for months, culminating in their final caving to the Oversight committee under threat of being held in contempt of Congress. They will now sit for closed-door depositions at the end of the month.</p> 
<p>It’s not immediately clear if Gates would be willing to share information with the committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic and Republican leaders showed no sign of narrowing their <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/dhs-funding-deal-shutdown-00763718" target="_blank">differences on Department of Homeland Security funding</a> Wednesday as a Feb. 13 deadline draws nearer.</p> 
<p>House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> and Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> reiterated demands for new restrictions on immigration enforcement agencies at a joint news conference. Flanked by other Democratic leaders, the leaders said they plan to submit draft legislation to Republicans by Thursday.</p> 
<p>“We're going to have tough, strong legislation,” Schumer said. “We want our Republican colleagues to finally get serious about this, because this is turning America inside out.”</p> 
<p>Earlier Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> not only warned that a deal would be next to impossible to consummate before next week’s deadline but threatened a possible long-term stopgap that would effectively exclude changes to immigration enforcement.</p> 
<p>Without quick progress in the talks, he said, “it may be the best way to deal with this particular appropriations bill is, do a year-long CR if that's what it takes,” Thune said, referring to a continuing resolution that would continue existing DHS funding levels through Sept. 30.</p> 
<p>While the two Democratic leaders reiterated in a news conference that they are “on the same page,” Jeffries and Schumer declined to draw the same red lines on a full-year DHS punt.</p> 
<p>Jeffries said after the news conference he is “a hard no” on a full-year CR, while Schumer stopped short of a hard commitment.</p> 
<p>“Republicans shouldn't expect our votes if they're not willing to enact strong, tough reform,” he said when asked if Senate Democrats would oppose another punt.</p> 
<p>The list of demands Jeffries and Schumer laid out Wednesday largely tracks with an earlier list of DHS proposals Senate Democrats put forward after the Jan. 24 killing of a Minneapolis man by federal agents there. They include prohibiting masks for federal agents in most circumstances and requiring a judge to sign off on warrants for DHS immigration apprehensions — proposals that some top Republicans have already rejected.</p> 
<p>In addition to the policy sparring Wednesday, there was some personal squabbling, too — including over who should be involved in notching any agreement.</p> 
<p>Thune suggested any deal needed to be cut primarily between Democrats and the Trump administration. He also warned that he does not view Jeffries as a reliable negotiating partner.</p> 
<p>“He's just not, and I think he and, for that matter, Leader Schumer are afraid of their shadows and they are getting a lot of blowback and pressure from their left,” he said. “I don't think he wants a deal at all. I think he wants the issue.”</p> 
<p>Jeffries, in response to the comments, said it was Thune who is “afraid of his own shadow” in the form of President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>“We are negotiating in good faith because we want to try to achieve an outcome, but the changes that are enacted with respect to the way in which the Department of Homeland Security is conducting itself need to be bold, meaningful and transformative,” he told reporters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Banking Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151800" data-person-id="151800">Tim Scott</a> on Wednesday said he did not believe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell committed a crime during his congressional testimony last year about the central bank’s headquarter renovations.</p> 
<p>“I was the one asking the questions,” he said on Fox Business. “Jay Powell was responding to me. Obviously, he and I have very, very strong disagreements on many issues, everyone.”</p> 
<p>He said it was time for a new head of the central bank and called Powell “inept” but added: “ineptness or being incompetent is not a criminal act.”</p> 
<p>“I believe what he did was made a gross error in judgment,” Scott said. “He was not prepared for that hearing. I do not believe that he committed a crime during the hearing.”</p> 
<p>The Justice Department issued subpoenas last month to the Fed, probing his statements to Congress, a fact revealed by Powell himself in an unprecedented video message where he accused the administration of using the investigation to pressure him to lower interest rates. Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907">Thom Tillis</a> (R-N.C.), saying he fears for the Fed’s independence, has said he will not vote to advance any Fed nominees until the administration has finished its probe.</p> 
<p>Scott said the issue would be “resolved,” adding: “Thom Tillis will be voting for Kevin Warsh as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.”</p> 
<p>Tillis has spoken positively of Warsh but said his stance regarding the DOJ investigation has not changed.</p> 
<p>Scott’s comments mark the first time that the powerful banking head has substantively weighed in on the administration’s move.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress just launched itself onto a nine-day runway to overcome deep partisan divides over the fate of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda — and conditions are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/dhs-funding-deal-shutdown-00763718" target="_blank">trending toward another lengthy shutdown</a> for the Department of Homeland Security.</p> 
<p>According to several senators, DHS funding talks were largely on hold while lawmakers waited for the House to clear the Senate-passed, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/congress-ends-shutdown-00762482" target="_blank">five-bill spending package</a> Tuesday and end the brief partial government shutdown. Now lawmakers have little time left before the Feb. 13 deadline to reach a bipartisan agreement on major changes to DHS policies and avoid a funding lapse that will also affect TSA, the Coast Guard, FEMA and other agencies — and Democrats are threatening to block any extension of the two-week stopgap measure.</p> 
<p><b>— A stalemate over demands: </b>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that Democrats plan to formally present Republicans a proposal soon for placing more guardrails around ICE and Customs and Border Protection. The wishlist could include tighter rules on the use of warrants, a ban on masks and mandates for body cameras and IDs on federal agents.</p> 
<p>There’s broad GOP opposition to many of these ideas. Speaker Mike Johnson argued Tuesday that unmasking would be especially dangerous for the agents.</p> 
<p>“I can tell you that we are never going to go along with adding an entirely new layer of judicial warrants,” Johnson added. “It is unimplementable.”</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune believes negotiations will need to be primarily between Democrats and the White House, though Republicans will play a part. He said Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland funding panel, will take the lead for the GOP.</p> 
<p>Republicans want to crack down on so-called “sanctuary cities,” localities that don’t comply with federal immigration laws. Some are also mulling whether to try and attach bigger immigration provisions onto the DHS stopgap bill, like increasing penalties for immigrants who cross the border illegally.</p> 
<p>But trying to crack down on “sanctuary cities” has long been a non-starter for Democrats. “We’re not going to make people unsafe, this is about making people safe,” said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, her chamber’s top Democratic appropriator.</p> 
<p><b>— A slippery stopgap slope: </b>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Tuesday that “an additional [continuing resolution], from our standpoint, is off the table” despite warnings from Thune and other Republicans that another short-term punt may be necessary to buy more time for talks.</p> 
<p>Some lawmakers are increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for reaching any DHS deal given Congress’ perennial struggle to agree on immigration policy.</p> 
<p>“I’m a little skeptical of the entire project here of trying to lard up an appropriations bill that funds critical agencies with a whole bunch of statutory restrictions,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said.</p> 
<p>Thune warned there’s another possibility: If negotiations drag on too long, lawmakers could eventually be forced to swallow a measure that keeps the status quo at DHS for the remainder of the fiscal year with no policy changes or new funding levels.</p> 
<p>“My assumption would be that even if we don’t have an agreement that we would do a CR for some foreseeable amount of time” to continue discussions, Thune told POLITICO, “or maybe at some point we have to resolve to a full-year CR.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress has 10 days to prevent another shutdown — this one exclusively affecting the Department of Homeland Security. There’s not much optimism about a deal.</p> 
<p>At issue is one of the thorniest issues in national politics — federal immigration enforcement, including new guardrails for agencies and repercussions for the local jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with them.</p> 
<p>Already, Republicans are rejecting central demands from Democrats, including tightening warrant requirements and banning federal agents from wearing masks. Democrats are pouring cold water on a GOP push to target so-called sanctuary cities.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> warned Tuesday that getting an agreement to President Donald Trump’s desk by the new Feb. 13 deadline is an “impossibility.”</p> 
<p>“We’ve got a very short timeframe in which to do this, which I argued against,” he said, referring to his opposition to the two-week DHS punt Democrats insisted on.</p> 
<p>House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a>, meanwhile, said Tuesday that another short-term patch was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/03/congress/no-more-dhs-crs-jeffries-00762600" target="_blank">“off the table” for Democrats</a>.</p> 
<p>Together those comments portend a potentially lengthy shutdown that would disproportionately impact the DHS functions that don’t involve immigration enforcement, including TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard. That’s because agencies like ICE and Border Patrol that have been at the center of the Democratic uproar received funding through the domestic policy megabill Republicans enacted in July.</p> 
<p>That reality had a critical mass of Senate Democrats ready to swallow full-year DHS funding last month that held agency budgets flat and passed the House with only seven Democratic votes. But that plan evaporated on Jan. 24, when DHS agents killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis and sparked bipartisan calls for new strictures on the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>Thune and other Republicans are already warning that they believe they will need to buy more time after the Feb. 13 deadline. Negotiations over an immigration enforcement deal have largely been on hold, according to several senators, as the House wrestled with the larger <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">spending package</a> that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/congress-ends-shutdown-00762482" target="_blank">finally passed Tuesday</a>.</p> 
<p>So far, Republicans and Democrats can’t even agree on who will be doing the negotiating. Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> is putting the onus on Thune. But Thune and other Republicans believe any viable deal will need to be negotiated primarily by the White House while keeping congressional Republicans “engaged.”</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/201768" data-person-id="201768">Brian Schatz</a> (D-Hawaii) said Tuesday that a deal would be difficult “without Trump deciding to drag Republicans in a direction that is normally uncomfortable for them.”</p> 
<p>“But that's different from John Thune just declaring that he's out,” he added. “The majority leader can't take himself out of the negotiation."</p> 
<p>A lengthy DHS shutdown could be uncomfortable quickly for both parties. While ICE and Customs and Border Protection would largely have a free hand to continue immigration enforcement, the Coast Guard and TSA would lose their appropriations — potentially snarling airports and threatening paychecks for an entire military branch. The Secret Service and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency would also be affected.</p> 
<p>Plenty of members are skeptical there will be a deal at all, given Congress’ perennial struggle to reach an agreement on anything even <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/05/congress/deal-nears-collapse-00139779" target="_blank">tangentially related to immigration</a>.</p> 
<p>“I have to say that I’m a little skeptical of this entire enterprise,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307631" data-person-id="307631">Josh Hawley</a> (R-Mo.) said. “I’m a little skeptical of the entire project here of trying to lard up an appropriations bill that funds critical agencies with a whole bunch of statutory restrictions.”</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/134505" data-person-id="134505">Glenn Ivey</a> (D-Md.) said of the incipient negotiation, “I can't say it feels like good faith.”</p> 
<p>Democrats have outlined several key demands for any negotiations and are expected to formally present a proposal “very shortly,” according to Schumer.</p> 
<p>But while Republicans have expressed openness to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/senators-block-funding-package-amid-dhs-standoff-00754927" target="_blank">some of the Democratic proposals</a>, such as body cameras and deescalation training, there is broad opposition to requiring immigration officers to obtain judicial warrants instead of administrative warrants before seeking apprehensions. Many, including Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, also oppose requiring federal agents to remove masks, arguing it would be a possible safety threat.</p> 
<p>“I can tell you that we are never going to go along with adding an entirely new layer of judicial warrants,” Johnson said Tuesday. “It is unimplementable. It cannot be done, and it should not be done. It's not necessary.”</p> 
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for language cracking down on sanctuary cities that don’t comply with ICE and CBP to be included in any agreement that includes new restrictions on those agencies. Other Republicans are mulling trying to attach bigger immigration provisions, including increasing penalties for immigrants who cross the border illegally or re-enter the country illegally.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51186" data-person-id="51186">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) used an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/03/trump-signs-1-2-trillion-funding-bill-to-end-shutdown-and-fund-dhs-for-two-weeks-00763475?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">Oval Office bill signing</a> with Trump Tuesday to make his pitch for a sanctuary cities crackdown as part of any negotiation to extend DHS funding.</p> 
<p>“If you want a debate on how to solve this problem, show up next week,” he said.</p> 
<p>Trump encouraged the push: “I hope you’re going to press that very hard,” he told Graham.</p> 
<p>But the policies Graham and other Republicans are proposing — such as imposing criminal penalties on state and local officials who “willfully interfere” with immigration enforcement — have long been a nonstarter for Democrats.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51180" data-person-id="51180">Dick Durbin</a>, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said it already would be “difficult” to get his caucus to support another funding punt, noting that roughly half of his Democratic colleagues already voted against the last spending package.</p> 
<p>And trying to link sanctuary cities to the debate over immigration enforcement tactics, Durbin added, is “not realistic.”</p> 
<p>“There's so many different versions of sanctuary law in these communities and states,” he said. “What we're talking about is funding this agency, but making sure there are reforms before funding.”</p> 
<p>Other Senate Democrats who voted for the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">spending deal</a> last week — including Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51219" data-person-id="51219">Patty Murray</a> (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee — are already warning that Republicans shouldn’t count on their votes again for another punt.</p> 
<p>Another senior Democratic appropriator, Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66834" data-person-id="66834">Jeanne Shaheen</a> of New Hampshire, said she believed there was enough time to get a deal if negotiators were “committed.”</p> 
<p>“But it would help if they start negotiating,” Shaheen said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A presidential pardon of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would not end Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907">Thom Tillis</a>’ one-man blockade of central bank nominees, the North Carolina Republican said Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Only the Justice Department resolving its investigation into Powell’s Senate testimony on a massive Fed renovation project would suffice, he added, doubling down on his intention to use his vote on the Senate Banking Committee as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/11/doj-probe-fed-powell-statements-headquarters-00721679" target="_blank">bulwark against any attempt</a> to dilute the bank’s independence.</p> 
<p>Tillis is the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/kevin-warsh-thom-tillis-federal-reserve-confirmation-00756958" target="_blank">main obstacle to the swift confirmation of Kevin Warsh</a>, President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace Powell as Fed chair. He has vowed to oppose any Fed nominee until the Powell investigation ends.</p> 
<p>A pardon could be a fast and definitive way for Trump to end any legal peril for Powell, but Tillis called the idea “silly” and a “mistake” because it could imply that Powell is guilty of committing perjury during his appearance last year before the Banking Committee.</p> 
<p>“A pardon to me almost validates the whole notion for the investigation,” Tillis said. “If they think they’ve got a valid case, then we’ll just see it through to the end.”</p> 
<p>With Republicans holding a 13-11 majority on the Banking panel, Tillis’ opposition is enough to prevent Warsh from getting advanced out of committee unless he gets support from Democrats on the panel.</p> 
<p>Tillis said Tuesday that he thought Warsh would be a “fine” Fed chair “at some point in the future if not this Congress, then the next Congress, if they don’t get this investigation done.”</p> 
<p>“I’m not budging one inch,” he added. “This is foundational to Fed independence and if you reward this sort of behavior and there’s no compelling evidence that could convince me or a jury that he’s guilty of it then you’ve got to stand on Fed independence.”</p> 
<p>Trump batted down a question Monday about whether he would ask prosecutors to drop the Powell case in order to clear a path for Warsh. He instead told reporters that Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for D.C., would “take it to the end and see.”</p> 
<p>Responding to Trump’s remarks, Tillis said it showed “an area where we’re in agreement this week — we’re both willing to go all the way.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress approved a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">spending package</a> Tuesday afternoon that secures funding for the vast majority of federal agencies through September, ending the second government shutdown in the span of four months.</p> 
<p>But what’s left unfinished — funding for the Department of Homeland Security — will be a doozy, with partisan tensions over President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda threatening another lapse for the embattled department that also includes TSA, FEMA and other crucial agencies.</p> 
<p>The package the House passed in a bipartisan 217-214 vote Tuesday afternoon only funds DHS through next week. Democrats are refusing to support months of additional cash until Republicans agree to rein in the actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents following the fatal shootings last month of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota.</p> 
<p>Trump is expected to swiftly sign the legislation, ending the partial government shutdown that began early Saturday morning after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">the Senate passed</a> the altered package, punting the measure back to the House.</p> 
<p>But if Republicans don’t concede to enacting significant new mandates for DHS by the new Feb. 13 deadline, the department many Democrats have called “rogue” will face another funding lapse or short-term patch.</p> 
<p>“We have a list that we want done, and we aren't settling for half-measures,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/226960" data-person-id="226960">Pete Aguilar</a> (D-Calif.), the No. 3 party leader, told reporters Tuesday. He warned that if Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> and Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> “don't want to come to the table and negotiate real reform, then they're going to have to explain to the American public why they're shutting down agencies.”</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders signaled Tuesday that they will defer to Trump in negotiating a DHS agreement with Democrats.</p> 
<p>“We will keep the wheels of progress turning and let the president do what he does best, and that's negotiate a final deal on his signature issue,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/364726" data-person-id="364726">Lisa McClain</a> (R-Mich.), the No. 4 GOP leader, said Tuesday. “If anyone can get this deal done that is going to crack down on illegal criminal aliens to protect our community, that's going to be President Donald J. Trump.”</p> 
<p>By advancing the trillion-dollar package, Congress has approved more than 95 percent of the government funding it approves each year to run federal agencies, after clearing full funding for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/house-votes-to-reopen-government-after-43-day-shutdown-00649927" target="_blank">some agencies in November</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/15/congress-funding-government-shutdown-00732209" target="_blank">another slate in January</a>.</p> 
<p>Under the legislation that now awaits the president’s signature, the Pentagon and all remaining domestic agencies besides DHS will get new funding levels through the end of the fiscal year, which started with the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.</p> 
<p>“We finalized true, bipartisan, bicameral bills to fully fund our government in a member driven, district focused way,” House Appropriations Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51327" data-person-id="51327">Tom Cole</a> (R-Okla.) said on the House floor. “Funding the government is not an optional exercise. It's the most basic duty we have in Congress.”</p> 
<p>Only 21 Democrats voted yes on passage, highlighting the challenge leaders face over the next 10 days in negotiating new immigration enforcement rules that can attract enough Democratic support for funding DHS into the fall.</p> 
<p>“I refuse to send another cent to Stephen Miller or Kristi Noem,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51512" data-person-id="51512">Jim McGovern</a> (D-Mass.) said this week. “They are undermining our Constitution, and the department they run is murdering American citizens in the streets.”</p> 
<p>To ensure Democratic leaders on both sides of the Capitol are aligned heading into negotiations with Republicans over changes to DHS immigration operations, House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> is set to meet Tuesday afternoon with Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a>.</p> 
<p>House Democrats are demanding that Jeffries have a seat at the bargaining table after many <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/02/house-democrats-senate-spending-deal-00761523" target="_blank">groused this week</a> about the altered funding package Senate Democrats brokered with the White House.</p> 
<p>“They need to talk to Hakeem — the House and Senate are equal partners,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/152934" data-person-id="152934">Debbie Dingell</a> (D-Mich.) said in an interview.</p> 
<p>House Democrats contend that they have a better understanding of Trump’s immigration enforcement actions in communities throughout the country, as well as the sentiment of Americans.</p> 
<p>“We are the ones that are closest to the anger and the frustration of our constituents,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/239242" data-person-id="239242">Pramila Jayapal</a> (D-Wash.) said in an interview. “We need [Senate Democrats] to start negotiating with us and carrying out our demands instead of constantly caving to Republicans.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7148" target="_blank">spending package</a> that would fund the vast majority of the federal government cleared a key procedural hurdle Tuesday, setting up votes later in the day to send the measure to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature.</p> 
<p>Final passage of the measure, which also includes a funding patch for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 13, would end the partial government shutdown that began Saturday.</p> 
<p>Republicans stayed mostly united on the 217-215 test vote to advance the package that would fund the Pentagon and departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through Sept. 30 and less than two weeks of funding for Homeland Security Department.</p> 
<p>The short-term DHS funding is intended to give lawmakers time to negotiate reforms to how ICE and CBP officers execute the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown, with the hope of tamping down instances where federal officers have killed U.S. citizens. Republicans have their own demands, such as blocking federal funding on “sanctuary cities” that don’t cooperate with federal enforcement agencies.</p> 
<p>The largely unified GOP vote came on the heels of a <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/02/house-gop-moves-to-tee-up-passage-of-shutdown-ending-package-00761481" target="_blank">White House whip operation</a> that headed off a handful of defections from within Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>’s party. Trump’s call for there to be no changes to the package in the House helped quell an effort from hard-line conservatives to attach a partisan elections bill, known as the SAVE Act, to the rule.</p> 
<p>Johnson, Majority Whip <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227580" data-person-id="227580">Tom Emmer</a> and Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a> also did some personal whipping on the House floor during the vote series, circulating between some of the most hard-line members of the Republican Conference in the lead-up to and during the rule vote. It was a nail-biter for the leaders, with the vote held open for nearly an hour as they tried to bring their GOP colleagues in line.</p> 
<p>James Blair, Trump's top political adviser, made calls to the holdouts during the vote, according to two people granted anonymity to describe the private whip effort. Trump urged Republicans to back the spending bill Monday in a Truth Social post.</p> 
<p>Final passage of <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/01/shutdown-senate-passes-funding-deal-00758615" target="_blank">the Senate-passed</a> $1.2 trillion funding package is expected Tuesday afternoon on a bipartisan vote.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview Tuesday he has made no decisions about bypassing Senate filibuster rules to skirt the normal 60-vote margin required to advance legislation in the chamber.</p> 
<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) said Monday she had White House-brokered "assurances" that the Senate would allow for a "standing" or "talking" filibuster that could allow the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_22" target="_blank">SAVE Act</a>, a House-passed elections bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/02/congress/mike-johnson-save-act-spending-00760523" target="_blank">pushed by conservative hard-liners</a>, to be enacted into law.</p> 
<p>Thune was not party to Luna's conversation with President Donald Trump, which prompted Luna to indicate she would support a massive spending bill moving through the House on Tuesday. Many GOP senators have long opposed weakening the 60-vote margin, believing it would open the door to far-reaching Democratic policies.</p> 
<p>"Some of our colleagues in the Senate are interested in it," Thune said. "We will have a conversation about it. Nothing decided."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview Tuesday morning that Republicans have given Bill and Hillary Clinton a noon deadline Tuesday to provide details of how they plan to comply with a pair of subpoenas issued by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which have until this point gone unheeded.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, Johnson said, Republicans will move forward with votes later this week to hold the former president and secretary of state in criminal contempt of Congress.</p> 
<p>“We're holding off until noon,” Johnson said. “They have a deadline until noon to work out the details, and if it's not done satisfactorily, then we'll proceed with the contempt.”</p> 
<p>Majority Leader Steve Scalise also said in an interview that, if the details aren't provided, then Republicans will proceed with a vote Wednesday as leadership had initially intended before the Clintons surprised Capitol Hill by reversing course. They had for months been resisting subpoenas to testify in the House Oversight investigation into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying the process was invalid and designed to embarrass and put them in prison.</p> 
<p>According to a person granted anonymity to share internal discussions between the Oversight Committee and the Clintons' legal team, the GOP-led panel is seeking clarification that the Clintons will accept the standard deposition terms for which they were originally subpoenaed. That includes transcribed, filmed depositions to take place in February, with no time limits.</p> 
<p>House Republicans appeared somewhat cautious Tuesday morning about pulling the trigger on the contempt votes, however. House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) was still interested in speaking with the former first couple in the service of his ongoing investigation — even after months of them dragging their feet — and Republicans continue to see the threat of contempt as a legitimate persuasion mechanism.</p> 
<p>"What we need is a signature on agreeing to terms," said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who brought the initial request in the Oversight subcommittee to subpoena the Clintons, in an interview. “I think we should have the deposition, but the contempt resolution needs to hang there and be available until we’re done."</p> 
<p>Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) also emphasized in an interview that the threat of contempt has historically provided an important piece of leverage to compel testimony. The goal was always for the Clintons to cooperate, he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>
