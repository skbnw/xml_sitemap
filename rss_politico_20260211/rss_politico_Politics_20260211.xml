      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the nation’s Democratic governors pledged to not attend events hosted by the White House later this month, after President Donald Trump snubbed some state executives amid his ongoing feud with blue states.</p> 
<p>POLITICO <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/white-house-excluding-dems-from-annual-governors-meeting-00769972" target="_blank">reported last week</a> that the White House decided to invite only Republicans to a meeting between the president and governors that was timed to the National Governors Association’s annual gathering — a break from its bipartisan past. And while a dinner celebrating governors of both parties was still planned, some Democrats — including Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado — confirmed they did not receive an invitation.</p> 
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that while the White House is the people’s house, “it's also the president's home, and so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s decision not to invite Moore — the association’s vice chair — and Polis sparked backlash from Democrats, with 18 sitting governors announcing that they would boycott the dinner.</p> 
<p>“If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,” the Democratic governors wrote in a joint statement Tuesday. “Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.”</p> 
<p>Moore also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/08/wes-moore-race-governors-trump-00770586" target="_blank">suggested Sunday</a> that his race may have played a role in the White House’s decision not to invite him to the event.</p> 
<p>“It’s not lost on me that I’m the only Black governor in this country, and I find that to be particularly painful, considering the fact that the president is trying to exclude me from an organization that not only my peers have asked me to help to lead, but then also a place where I know I belong in,” he said in an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union.”</p> 
<p>POLITICO previously reported that the NGA decided not to sponsor the planned meeting between Trump and the governors once it became clear only Republicans would be invited, with the organization writing in an email to people involved in planning that “no NGA resources will be used to support transportation for this activity.”</p> 
<p>Brandon Tatum, the CEO of the NGA, said in a statement last week that the group was “disappointed in the administration’s decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.”</p> 
<p>At last year’s annual meeting between Trump and the governors, the president <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/dem-governor-trump-court-022015" target="_blank">got into an argument</a> with Maine Gov. Janet Mills over his administration’s moves to restrict transgender athletes’ participation in school sports, with Trump ultimately threatening to pull funding and Mills promising to sue.</p> 
<p>The NGA has undergone considerable turmoil in the last year, with Democratic governors raising alarm about the association’s unwillingness to more vocally criticize the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/newsom-pritzker-threaten-to-pull-out-of-national-governors-association-over-trumps-troop-deployments-00595741" target="_blank">threatened to withdraw</a> from the group over Trump’s decision to deploy other states’ National Guard troops to their states.</p> 
<p>Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, the group’s Republican chair, also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/09/kevin-stitt-republican-governor-national-guard-00600305" target="_blank">criticized the administration’s National Guard deployments</a>, telling The New York Times in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/oklahoma-governor-national-guard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">an October interview</a> that he worried the president was undermining states’ rights.</p> 
<p>In a letter sent Monday by Stitt to other governors and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-kevin-stitt-governors-meeting-washington-ee4e696534082638795e1804d71f4966" target="_blank">obtained by The Associated Press</a>, he urged members to unite together, writing “the solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/us/politics/trump-republican-governors-white-house.html" target="_blank">The New York Times also first reported</a> last week that some Democratic governors weren’t invited to the dinner.</p> 
<p>“The President has the discretion to invite whomever he wants to the White House, and he welcomes all those who received an invitation to come, and if they don't want to, that's their loss,” Leavitt said of the dinner on Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Hampshire magnate with ties to power players in both parties has appeared in successive batches of the Epstein files, roiling politics in his home state and threatening its two most influential political dynasties.</p> 
<p>Documents recently released by the Department of Justice suggest that entrepreneur Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway and other devices, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02142810.pdf" target="_blank"><u>kept in contact</u></a> with Jeffrey Epstein <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00664167.pdf" target="_blank"><u>long after Epstein pleaded guilty</u></a> to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008, with emails indicating he visited the disgraced financier’s Caribbean island in 2013. Kamen has not been accused of wrongdoing and did not respond to requests for comment through his companies Monday.</p> 
<p>The recently released files indicate a closer relationship between the two than was previously known. The disclosures have prompted Kamen’s organizations to launch investigations into their ties. And the situation has ratcheted up scrutiny of the New Hampshire politicians who have worked with him, received <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=kamen%2C+dean" target="_blank"><u>campaign contributions</u></a> from him or helped his organizations secure <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2024-07-03/armi-manchester-lands-another-44m-in-federal-funds-as-part-of-tech-hubs-program" target="_blank"><u>tens of millions</u></a> in federal funds.</p> 
<p>That includes members of the Shaheen and Sununu families, the best-known and most powerful clans in the state’s Democratic and Republican parties. Both have scions running for Congress this year: House candidate Stefany Shaheen, the daughter of retiring Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and former Sen. John E. Sununu (R-N.H.), the son of a former governor, who is seeking to return to the Senate.</p> 
<p>They now face Epstein-fueled attacks from their lower-polling rivals.</p> 
<p>“Anywhere Epstein pops up these days, it’ll become a campaign issue,” said Ryan Williams, a GOP strategist who has worked with Sununu and his father. “And there are certainly politicians who have worked with Kamen in New Hampshire, taken his money and associated with him. And those who did will have to answer for it.”</p> 
<p>Kamen is a New Hampshire institution and local celebrity — often described as a quirky one — in a state that has few big-name figures but exerts a powerful hold on the presidential nominating process. The pioneering inventor and entrepreneur who developed the first portable insulin pump and a wheelchair that can climb stairs, Kamen is also widely credited for driving the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/realestate/commercial/commercial-real-estate-manchester-millyard.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20millyard%20is%20going%20to,the%20University%20of%20New%20Hampshire." target="_blank"><u>transformation of Manchester’s old mill district into a technological and health care hub</u></a>. He was lauded as a “hero” for <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/health/coronavirus/massive-shipment-of-ppe-arrives-courtesy-of-nh-dean-kamen/article_4aa969e8-581d-562c-b3c9-a0600f90fce8.html" target="_blank"><u>helping secure 91,000 pounds of protective equipment</u></a> for first responders and health care workers at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic when such resources were scarce.</p> 
<p>Kamen has donated roughly $90,000 to federal candidates and campaign committees on both sides of the aisle over the past four decades, according to federal campaign finance filings. That includes over $7,000 apiece to Sununu, Sen. Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte, the former senator who’s up for reelection as governor this year. Kamen has not made any federal campaign contributions this election cycle, per federal reports.</p> 
<p>He’s hosted a raft of high-profile politicians at his businesses and his Bedford home over the years, from Ayotte to then-President <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0918/p13s01-bogn.html" target="_blank"><u>George W. Bush</u></a>. He traveled to Dubai with Sununu’s younger brother, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, in 2019 during a <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/sununu-recounts-his-days-in-dubai/article_7ffc3e50-b78a-5457-9724-546d2f3513f3.html" target="_blank"><u>trip in which the two attended the World Government Summit</u></a>. Chris Sununu, through Airlines for America, the lobbying firm he now leads, did not respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Those ties, once promoted in press releases and splashed across social media, have turned into a political liability after successive document drops showed deeper connections between Kamen and Epstein.</p> 
<p>Photos <a href="https://www.nepm.org/2025-12-22/dean-kamen-epstein-segway-photo-files-nh" target="_blank"><u>released in December</u></a> show Kamen socializing with Epstein in a tropical location and riding a Segway with Ghislaine Maxwell, the Epstein associate who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021. Documents released on Jan. 30 showed Kamen <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01796649.pdf" target="_blank"><u>made plans</u></a> to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02021195.pdf" target="_blank"><u>visit</u></a> Epstein’s Caribbean island in 2013. At the time, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00392548.pdf" target="_blank"><u>assistants sent emails discussing</u></a> “which flight Dean prefers the girls to be on.” Days later, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01785295.pdf" target="_blank"><u>he wrote to Epstein</u></a>: “thank you for hosting an incredible visit to [sic] a magical place. It really is almost unbelievable.”</p> 
<p>Kamen did not respond to questions from POLITICO about his association with Epstein, including whether he visited Little Saint James. He previously <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/dean-kamen-on-leave-from-first-amid-review-into-epstein-involvement/70213104" target="_blank"><u>described having “limited interactions” with Epstein</u></a> in statements to other media outlets and has <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/dean-kamen-jeffrey-epstein-photo-121225/69714045" target="_blank">denied knowledge of his “horrific actions”</a> beyond what he learned from news reports. He told <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/02/05/metro/nh-armi-dean-kamen-epstein-review/" target="_blank"><u>The Boston Globe</u></a> that Epstein had reached out to him about becoming involved in international development projects but after initial meetings, “it became apparent that his only interest was self-promotion” and “I avoided further meetings.” He did not respond to The Globe’s inquiry about the reference to “the girls.” After the latest tranche of documents was released, he <a href="https://www.armiusa.org/news/statement-from-armi-board-of-directors/" target="_blank"><u>recused himself</u></a> from <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2026/02/06/beta-technologies-board-member-appears-newly-released-epstein-files/" target="_blank"><u>board activities</u></a> of at least four companies he’s involved with as they <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/about/press-room/a-statement-from-first-board-chair-laurie-leshin" target="_blank"><u>engage outside law firms</u></a> to conduct <a href="https://www.sequelmedtech.com/news" target="_blank"><u>independent investigations</u></a> into the disclosures.</p> 
<p>Williams, the Republican strategist, said “the Epstein episode is the first real blemish that’s marked his reputation in the state, and it’s an extremely hot issue right now.”</p> 
<p><b>EPSTEIN FILES AS A CAMPAIGN CUDGEL</b></p> 
<p>Stefany Shaheen, who is running for New Hampshire’s open House seat and served as chief strategy officer for Kamen’s Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute from September 2018 until last month, is facing intensifying scrutiny over her dealings with Kamen. She has posted photos of her with Kamen on social media over the years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stefany-shaheen-91a19180_definitely-too-soon-to-add-co-pilot-to-my-activity-6413150118186487808-0s9h/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAAxanxMBraY7XdtdOsyaKlgkR24SDzgVw-Q" target="_blank"><u>one of the two of them in the cockpit of a plane</u></a> that was uploaded to LinkedIn seven years ago, and another from a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIMlB6px6sv/?igsh=MTFvYXE2M2k2aWI2ag%3D%3D" target="_blank"><u>gala for Type 1 Diabetes research</u></a> last April where she was an honoree. Her campaign said the former was taken during a flight to Washington with others affiliated with ARMI for an American Society Of Mechanical Engineers meeting on June 14, 2018, <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/society-news/asme-news/hosts-congressional-briefing-highlighting" target="_blank"><u>where Kamen spoke</u></a>.</p> 
<p>She is now facing calls from two of her Democratic primary rivals to publicly <a href="https://indepthnh.org/2026/02/03/stefany-shaheens-dean-kamen-ties-become-a-problem/" target="_blank"><u>condemn Kamen</u></a>. One of them, Christian Urrutia, has also <a href="https://x.com/urrutiafornh/status/2018682284048539705?s=20" target="_blank"><u>accused her of potentially helping Kamen craft his statements</u></a> in response to the files, which she has denied.</p> 
<p>“There’s certainly an element of transparency. I think there is a fundamental question of: Do we want our members of Congress and our senators to have these types of relationships?” said Urrutia, who also asked why Sen. Shaheen did not disclose her daughter’s role at ARMI when <a href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=6986333b0f06cb8bead582f2&amp;Domain=politico.com&amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;Lang=en&amp;Base64Url=eNoFwlEKgDAIANAbKURfXWbIdOVgU6Y0un2892R6XIh7byD3Zb6UUm0GhExKgdte1GE4hJWQrWL7jrPUHqVygHP7AYJTGZ4%3D&amp;@OriginalLink=www.appropriations.senate.gov" target="_blank"><u>securing a $1.2 million earmark</u></a> for the company in 2023. A spokesperson for the senator said that her daughter was paid through non-federal funding sources and that her office was advised by Senate Ethics Committee staff that the request for funding for ARMI did not violate ethics rules.</p> 
<p>A Republican running for the seat, state Rep. Brian Cole, has <a href="https://x.com/cole4nh/status/2020291693153579107?s=20" target="_blank"><u>called on the younger Shaheen to drop out</u></a>: “Until Stefany Shaheen provides full and honest answers about her association with Dean Kamen and ARMI, she should end her campaign,” he said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Sununu, who is running to reclaim the Senate seat he lost to Shaheen’s mother in 2008, has faced questions over a possible reference to him <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00892582.pdf" target="_blank"><u>in a 2010 email</u></a> between Epstein and Boris Nikolic, a former Bill Gates adviser. In the email, Epstein emailed Nikolic that “john sununu, has good stories,” but did not provide any additional details. It’s unclear what he meant or whether he was referring to the senator or his father, former governor and White House chief of staff John H. Sununu.</p> 
<p>The younger Sununu was a director of operations at Teletrol Systems, one of Kamen’s companies, in the 1990s before he was elected to Congress.</p> 
<p>His GOP primary rival, former Sen. Scott Brown, has seized on the email to attack the Sununu family’s “‘insider’ ties” as he attempts to gain traction in a race where the Republican establishment and the president have lined up behind his opponent. Brown <a href="https://nhjournal.com/podcast-scott-brown-is-not-backing-down/" target="_blank"><u>said on a local podcast</u></a> that Sununu “needs to fully explain why” his surname is mentioned in the files. Brown <a href="https://x.com/SenScottBrown/status/2019499395209699644?s=20" target="_blank"><u>added on X</u></a> that voters “shouldn’t have to guess who, or which one of their representatives were associated, or what ‘stories’ are being referenced in federal documents.”</p> 
<p>The Shaheen and Sununu campaigns have sought to dismiss the criticism from their opponents.</p> 
<p>Shaheen said in a statement that she “never advised Dean Kamen on these matters” and that the “extent of my knowledge” about his and Epstein’s relationship is what has been publicly reported. Harrell Kirstein, a spokesperson for her campaign, dismissed the criticism as “desperate political attacks — flat out lies — that ignore basic facts.”</p> 
<p>Both Shaheens said they supported outside investigations of Kamen.</p> 
<p>Sen. Shaheen said in a statement that Kamen “was right to step back” from his organizations, and that it was appropriate for them “to conduct independent reviews to fully understand his connection to Epstein and take any action merited by the findings of those reviews.”</p> 
<p>Stefany Shaheen is the polling leader in the Democratic primary for New Hampshire’s blue-leaning 1st Congressional District, a position operatives in both parties attribute in large part to name recognition. A <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1921&amp;context=survey_center_polls" target="_blank"><u>University of New Hampshire survey from January</u></a> showed her with 33 percent support, and no other candidate with more than 10 percent, with 39 percent of likely primary voters undecided.</p> 
<p>Sununu led Brown by 23 percentage points in the same poll, with 26 percent of likely GOP primary voters undecided. They both trail Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in hypothetical general-election matchups.</p> 
<p>Mike Schrimpf, a spokesperson for Sununu’s campaign, said in a statement that “John had no knowledge whatsoever of any relationship between Dean Kamen and Epstein” and believes the latter “was a despicable human being.” Neither Sununu or his father “have ever met or communicated in any way with Boris Nikolic, Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”</p> 
<p>He went on to attack Shaheen and Pappas — who, along with other members of the all-Democratic congressional delegation, had touted federal funding for ARMI before the Kamen scandal broke — over their connections to the entrepreneur: “Unlike Chris Pappas who celebrated federal funding for Kamen's ARMI, or Stefany Shaheen who worked for him last week, John never advocated or requested funding for any of Kamen's ventures,” Schrimpf said.</p> 
<p>Gates MacPherson, a spokesperson for Pappas’ campaign, said in a statement that the congressman “believes Dean Kamen’s relationship with Epstein is deeply troubling and must be independently investigated, and all federal contractors and grant awardees should be held to the highest possible standards, including ARMI and FIRST.”</p> 
<p>In the governor’s race, Democrats are preparing to attack Ayotte over Kamen’s past contributions to her campaigns and his appearance in an ad <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/wmur-first-new-ayotte-ad-shows-her-as-independent-leader-fighting-for-nh/5211839" target="_blank"><u>for her 2016 Senate reelection campaign</u></a>. Ayotte has yet to draw a serious opponent in her bid for a second term. Representatives for the governor did not respond to an email to her official and campaign inboxes seeking comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not all Americans’ votes are equal. And some have a way bigger impact than others.</p> 
<p>Every four years, a small handful of swing states are bombarded with advertising, candidate visits and more when the country picks the next president, while a majority of other voters are mostly ignored. But even in the key swing states, some House contests, governor’s races and even legislative districts are far more competitive than others.</p> 
<p>That’s why the nonpartisan nonprofit Power Moves is rolling out a new Voter Impact Index — the details of which were <a href="https://www.powermoves.vote/voter-impact-index-map" target="_blank">shared first with POLITICO</a> — to help people take into account their voting power.</p> 
<p>“We all learned in elementary school and middle school that every vote counts, and a vote is a vote,” said Heather Weston, one of the group’s co-founders. “But we kind of intuit that that's not true. So what we really wanted people to understand is how geography really is connected to the impact of your vote.”</p> 
<p>The project utilizes all of America’s 41,000-plus zip codes to measure how much of an impact a voter can have, something the organization’s co-founders say is unique to their product.</p> 
<p>To get the “Voter Impact” score, which ranges from 0-100, Power Moves has a <a href="https://www.powermoves.vote/our-methodology" target="_blank">complex methodology</a>. But in short, it weighs the competitiveness of recent elections in the zip code for six public offices, ranging from the presidency to legislative races — and the higher the score, the more competitive elections an American has the opportunity to vote in.</p> 
<p>It weights some of those offices as more important than others. For example, the competitiveness of the presidential election, Senate seat and House district in a given zip code each get 25 percent of the score, while governor’s races get 15 percent and state House and Senate seats only get five percent each.</p> 
<p>No individual zip code got either a zero or a 100, based on their methodology. But voters in the Eau Claire, Wisconsin, zip code of 54703 came out on top with a score of 85. And most of Wyoming ties for the lowest score at 14. (Perhaps not coincidentally: The state with the highest statewide average is Wisconsin, and Wyoming is the lowest.)</p> 
<p>With more than 40 million Americans moving each year — and some millions of college students moving to new states — the tool is aimed at helping people really understand where their vote can go the furthest.</p> 
<p>People move for a variety of factors, and Power Moves emphasized that the tool is not supposed to be the only factor people weigh when deciding their new home. But as home-buying and renting tools like Zillow already factor things like walkability and school systems into their own algorithms, they hope voting can crack that list of priorities. Plus, because of the wonky ways district lines are drawn, apartments and houses that are just minutes apart can garner completely different voting scores.</p> 
<p>“We really don’t care what your political stripes are,” said Charles Simon, another co-founder. “We just want to help everybody to understand their vote impact score and give them the opportunity to maximize that score.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top state Republicans in Georgia have quietly opened the door for the Republican National Committee to support Lt. Gov. Burt Jones in the state’s hotly contested primary for governor.</p> 
<p>The RNC normally maintains strict neutrality in party primaries to let voters — not party leaders — choose its nominee. Any move to intervene in Georgia, however, could dramatically reshape a crowded race for an open governor's seat in a premiere battleground state. It could give Jones, President Donald Trump’s handpicked choice, a boost in a field that includes Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a target of Trump’s ire ever since he refused to echo the president’s falsehoods about the 2020 election in his state.</p> 
<p>Georgia’s three RNC members signed letters late last year and early this year waiving the party rule that bars the RNC from intervening in contested primaries, according to three people familiar with the agreement. That move allows the national party to provide financial or operating support to Jones and coordinate with him ahead of the May primary.</p> 
<p>It’s unclear whether the RNC will move to support Jones in the crowded primary now that it’s been cleared to do so. But it was the RNC that first reached out to the Georgia party leaders about waiving the rule, according to a person familiar with the process — a sign the national party has at least considered getting off the sidelines. The RNC did not provide a comment.</p> 
<p>Josh McKoon, the chair of the Georgia Republican Party, said he signed the letter waiving the RNC’s neutrality rule because Jones has Trump's endorsement.</p> 
<p>“It was a no-brainer for me to sign the letter,” McKoon told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“From my perspective, I was going to remove any barriers to working with the RNC from a candidate that the president has clearly signaled as the candidate he wants to be the next governor,” he said.</p> 
<p>Jones has long been a vocal supporter of Trump. He endorsed him for president in 2015, and as a state senator, was among the 16 Republicans who attempted to serve as electors in 2020 and falsely certify Trump’s loss in Georgia as a win. Jones received Trump’s official endorsement in August, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1714167236228311" target="_blank">released a video with Jones last week</a> calling him a “friend” who’s “going to make a great, great governor.”</p> 
<p>Limited early public polling shows Jones leading the field, and he maintains a sizable war chest, but the race remains fluid, and a prolonged and expensive primary could complicate Republicans’ general election prospects. RNC support could help Jones fend off rivals and potentially avoid a prolonged primary fight, especially if he can avoid a run-off.</p> 
<p>Last week, health care business owner Rick Jackson injected new uncertainty into the race by launching a surprise gubernatorial bid, pledging to spend $50 million of his own money to support his campaign. He has presented himself as a Trump-aligned political outsider, a message that could cut into Jones’ base.</p> 
<p>A <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2026/02/rick-jacksons-campaign-for-governor-resets-fight-for-maga-base-in-georgia/" target="_blank">Cygnal poll</a> released Monday, after Jackson’s surprise campaign launch, found Jones leading with 22 percent support among likely primary voters. Jackson followed at 16 percent, with Raffensperger at 10 percent and Attorney General Chris Carr at 7 percent.</p> 
<p>To avoid a June run-off, a candidate must secure an outright majority of the vote in the May 19 primary — a high bar in an increasingly crowded field.</p> 
<p>“I can see a path to victory for all four of them right now.” said Jason Shepherd, a former Cobb County GOP chair who is backing Carr. “But Burt Jones’ path to victory just got a lot harder” with Jackson’s entrance.</p> 
<p><a href="https://prod-static.gop.com/media/Rules_Of_The_Republican_Party.pdf" target="_blank">Under RNC rules</a>, the national party is barred from backing candidates in primaries unless the filing deadline has passed and a candidate is running unopposed. That requirement, known as Rule 11, can be waived if all three of a state’s RNC members sign off. Such Rule 11 agreements have been used sparingly in recent cycles.</p> 
<p>State party leaders in North Carolina have green-lit early support for former RNC chair Michael Whatley, another Trump-backed candidate running for the state’s open Senate seat.</p> 
<p>Both Georgia and North Carolina are top priorities for the Republican Party in November. In Georgia, Republicans are looking to retain control of the governor’s mansion in a state that Trump flipped in 2024. The steps taken in both states raise questions about whether the RNC could face pressure to take similar moves in other states’ primaries where Trump decides to take sides, such as in Louisiana, where he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/20/letlow-senate-cassidy-trump-00736200" target="_blank">endorsed Rep. Julia Letlow</a>in her primary challenge against Sen. Bill Cassidy.</p> 
<p>“We all look very carefully at when [Trump] decides to weigh in a race, because he doesn't always do that,” McKoon said. “I certainly didn't want to be serving as an obstacle to the RNC being able to coordinate with his campaign and provide support.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement furiously denounced Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX halftime show, denigrating the Puerto Rican superstar and claiming he does not truly represent America.</p> 
<p>Trump, who previously <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/24/us-news/trump-tells-the-post-hes-skipping-the-super-bowl-slams-halftime-performers-bad-bunny-and-green-day/" target="_blank">called Bad Bunny a “terrible choice”</a> to head up the NFL’s largest annual broadcast, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/08/trump-bashes-bad-bunnys-halftime-spectacle-00771021" target="_blank">chimed in with complaints</a> about the show’s first-ever mostly-Spanish performance: “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116038200403048483" target="_blank">he wrote in a lengthy Truth Social post</a>, calling it "one of the worst, EVER!"</p> 
<p>At Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, Bad Bunny delivered a 13-minute homage to his homeland, weaving through a sugarcane field studded with bodegas and a traditional casita. His show was lauded by fans as a vibrant celebration of Puerto Rican heritage — but Trump and MAGA faithfuls weren’t so convinced.</p> 
<p>Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, the Puerto Rican-born singer better known as Bad Bunny, made his Super Bowl debut in 2020 alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. But since the NFL announced him as the Super Bowl headliner in September, he became a focal point for conservative ire — thanks, in part, to his high-profile political activism.</p> 
<p>An <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/08/bad-bunny-super-bowl-immigration-00770475" target="_blank">outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s hard-line</a> immigration crackdown, he declared “ICE out” onstage at last week’s Grammy Awards — where his album "DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS" made history as the first all-Spanish record to snag the show’s coveted album of the year trophy — and left viewers wondering what message he might have for the millions of football fans tuning into his set.</p> 
<p>But Bad Bunny did not directly call out any of the president’s policies or supporters during his Super Bowl show. The only English he spoke during Sunday’s show was him saying, “God bless America,” as he was marching off the field with a procession of Latin and South American flags — led by the U.S.’s flag. He then spiked a football that read: “together, we are America.”</p> 
<p>His show also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/30/puerto-rico-electric-grid-blackouts-hurricanes-00257176" target="_blank">referenced the island’s long-struggling power grid</a>.</p> 
<p>In the hours after the performance, MAGA allies took issue with the show’s mostly-Spanish discography and Puerto Rican inspiration.</p> 
<p>“Was a single word of English spoken during the Super Bowl Halftime Show?” Nick Adams, Trump’s pick to become ambassador to Malaysia, <a href="https://x.com/NickAdamsinUSA/status/2020671666020376722?s=20" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “Someone needs to tell Bad Bunny he’s in America. This is an abomination.”</p> 
<p>Far-right influencer Laura Loomer railed against his set in a series of X posts, urging border czar Tom Homan to <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/2020672109018481057?s=20" target="_blank">deploy an immigration raid on site</a>.</p> 
<p>“There’s nothing American about any of this,” <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/2020678486646534164?s=20" target="_blank">she wrote</a>. “This isn’t White enough for me. Cant even watch a Super Bowl anymore because immigrants have literally ruined everything.”</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, MAGA-friendly influencer Jake Paul <a href="https://x.com/jakepaul/status/2020615566436815275?s=20" target="_blank">urged his X followers to “turn off this halftime,”</a> decrying Bad Bunny as a “fake American citizen performing who publicly hates America.” Paul, who was recently seen with Vice President JD Vance at the Olympics in Milan, received swift blowback online, including from Paul’s own brother, Logan. </p> 
<p>Many, including <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/2020855353223545156?s=20" target="_blank">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> (D-N.Y.), pointed out that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens — and that Paul himself <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/09/sports/jake-paul-clarifies-bad-bunny-fake-citizen-stance/" target="_blank">has been living there since 2021</a>.</p> 
<p>Other figures within the president’s orbit echoed their disapproval. Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino reacted to Bad Bunny’s performance in a <a href="https://rumble.com/v75ijp4-kid-rock-sad-bunny-ep.-2448-02092026.html" target="_blank">podcast episode on Rumble</a> titled “Kid Rock &gt; Sad Bunny,” <a href="https://rumble.com/v75ijp4-kid-rock-sad-bunny-ep.-2448-02092026.html" target="_blank">telling viewers the show “sucked.”</a> Meanwhile, Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, wrote on X that <a href="https://x.com/HarmeetKDhillon/status/2020660639350616256?s=20" target="_blank">she and her family “aren’t watching him.”</a></p> 
<p>Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) called the show “disgusting” and said it violated broadcast standards, <a href="https://x.com/RepFine/status/2020925409043313023?s=20" target="_blank">writing on X</a> that he plans to send a letter to FCC Chair Brendan Carr demanding a review.</p> 
<p>“Had he said these lyrics — and all of the other disgusting and pornographic filth in English on live TV, the broadcast would have been pulled down and the fines would have been enormous,” Fine wrote. "Lock them up."</p> 
<p>Conservatives did rally behind alternative programming. Turning Point USA, the conservative organizing group founded by Charlie Kirk, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/02/turning-point-usa-super-bowl-halftime-show-00761040" target="_blank">aired a rival halftime show</a> headlined by longtime Trump ally Kid Rock, drawing support from Republican officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who praised the event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is watching for Bad Bunny to make a political statement at the Super Bowl. Democrats are watching closely to figure out how to make their own.</p> 
<p>Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, the Puerto Rican recording artist known globally by his stage name, has created a pop culture phenomenon that will converge at a historic halftime show performance at the Super Bowl on Sunday when the New England Patriots play the Seattle Seahawks. Though Bad Bunny already made his Super Bowl debut alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez back in 2020, this time the spotlight will be on him and his exclusively in-Spanish catalog. And while his invitation triggered a harsh backlash on the right from the president on down, it’s also marking a major inflection point for Hispanic Americans of all backgrounds.</p> 
<p>Sunday may prove to be Bad Bunny’s biggest chance to move the dial.</p> 
<p>There’s an opportunity here, Democrats told POLITICO, to turn Bad Bunny’s cultural phenomenon into a political one, right as the party is mounting its strongest resistance to Trump’s sweeping deportation agenda — and with months to go before the midterms to make amends with Latino voters who have left their tent.</p> 
<p>Former Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), who is of Puerto Rican descent and whose tenure in the House was marked by his outspokenness for the Latino communities he represented, emphasized that Democrats need to seize this moment to win back Latino support.</p> 
<p>Democrats “do too little to engage the Latino community, and then they wonder why all these Latinos voted for Trump? Because you didn't knock on their doors asking to vote for the Democrat. You failed to message us in so many ways,” he said. “They should embrace it.”</p> 
<p>“It's such a huge watershed moment,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said. “I wouldn't be surprised if he used this as a very unifying moment, but also on very resonant and salient grounds to send a message to people.”</p> 
<p>There’s already signs of what’s on the Latino rapper’s mind.</p> 
<p>“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say, ‘ICE out,’” Bad Bunny said last Sunday as he accepted the Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album for his record-smashing “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” — just hours before taking home the night’s biggest prize, Album of the Year. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens — we are humans, and we are Americans.”</p> 
<p>Bad Bunny isn’t new to political endeavors. But he has long focused primarily on island politics — he’s a big activist for Puerto Rican independence — and has only occasionally weighed in on mainland issues.</p> 
<p>In 2024, shortly after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe infamously disparaged Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” during the pre-show for Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, Bad Bunny posted an endorsement of Kamala Harris to his tens of millions of Instagram followers. But he never appeared with Harris on the campaign trail.</p> 
<p>His political trajectory has followed other Latino voters’ in recent months, however. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/11/24/majorities-of-latinos-disapprove-of-trump-and-his-policies-on-immigration-economy/" target="_blank">Polls show many Hispanics</a> have been particularly outraged at the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. And they are highly motivated to vote and could shift left, after consecutive election cycles where Trump made significant inroads with Latinos.</p> 
<p>Americans overall <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668" target="_blank">in recent polling</a> have shown an increasing souring on Trump’s handling of immigration. The two fatal shootings in Minneapolis and the stream of videos of ICE raids online are driving a fierce grassroots opposition that is pushing Democrats to hold the line on the Hill and not cave in negotiations on the DHS funding bill. But Trump's crackdown has been felt most acutely in Latino communities. For many, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/five-year-old-boy-detained-by-ice-has-returned-minnesota-lawmaker-says-2026-02-01/" target="_blank">stories of families being detained</a> have fueled a feeling of solidarity across the diaspora.</p> 
<p>“That's bringing people of all kinds together — especially the Latino community, the diaspora of Latino communities, that come from so many different places, so many different subcultures. It's bringing us together in a new vision of latinidad,” said Chicago Alderman Michael Rodriguez, who represents the city’s historically Mexican Little Village community. “Our community is being assaulted right now.”</p> 
<p>During Bad Bunny’s massive world tour last year, the artist did not schedule any shows on the U.S. mainland, in part due to concerns that ICE would target his concerts for immigration enforcement operations. “It’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” <a href="https://i-d.co/article/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-residency-issue-375-cover/" target="_blank">he told i-D magazine in a September interview</a>.</p> 
<p>After the rapper was announced as the halftime performer in September, Corey Lewandowski <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/trump-advisor-ice-agents-bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-1236536667/" target="_blank">said there would be</a> ICE enforcement operations at the Super Bowl — seemingly bringing to life some of the concerns that Martínez Ocasio voiced. Local leaders in the Bay Area have said this week they’ve privately been told no ICE officers will be at the show. DHS has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/super-bowl-bad-bunny-trump-politics-1447163cfa820cbb0c96973c20ccd976" target="_blank">remained more vague publicly</a> about enforcement plans around the game. DHS did not respond to a request for comment on this story.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Republicans this weekend — many of whom in the MAGA universe have referred to Martínez Ocasio as “Woke Bunny” — are holding their own halftime performance to make a statement. Turning Point is counterprogramming Bad Bunny’s performance with a made-for-television “All American Halftime Show” featuring Kid Rock. “I think that that part of the country just felt offended,” said Andrew Kolvert, a spokesperson for Turning Point. “There needs to be a counter voice that says, ‘Hey, you know, we love this country. We love the rule of law, we love our troops, we love law enforcement, we love traditional America.’”</p> 
<p>For Democrats, the question of how to better engage and win in Latino communities has dogged them as the party searches for a way out of the wilderness since their 2024 election losses. Bad Bunny has shown a natural ability to bring those communities together with his music, filling stadiums across the world for multi-night shows.</p> 
<p>“It’s not that easy. We’re 23 countries, we fight each other every day,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), who represents the largest Puerto Rican community in the Midwest — and whose city of Chicago was an early target of Trump's increased immigration enforcement efforts. “For Bad Bunny to be able to bring Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Guatemalans, Dominicans together, and all feel like they’re being heard and that he can represent them, says a lot about who is.”</p> 
<p>As for Martínez Ocasio, he’s keeping mum about what to expect from his performance on Sunday night. “It’s going to be a huge party,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-f441549a00166a39309233f689163105" target="_blank">he said at a preview event on Thursday</a>. “I want to bring to the stage, of course, a lot of my culture. But I really don’t, I don’t want to give any spoilers. It’s going to be fun.”</p> 
<p>The cultural solidarity that Bad Bunny’s music has fostered could translate into political unity, Rodriguez, the Chicago alderman, said. And some of his fellow Democrats are ready to build on the moment.</p> 
<p>“There's just no scenario where he is not going to have a message,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said. “There are moments in history that really move a community and solidify them within a political movement. And I think that's happening right now.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National Republicans are throwing money and bodies at a down-ballot initiative to try to wrest back a congressional seat in Utah. Their efforts could blow up in their face.</p> 
<p>With a looming February 15 deadline, Republicans have seen only half the number of verified signatures they need to move things forward. And the effort, which has the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115946953654029014" target="_blank"><u>backing of President Donald Trump</u></a> and support from multiple MAGA groups, has devolved into chaos.</p> 
<p>Local county clerks are flagging hundreds of potentially fraudulent submissions. People have <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51440458/i-felt-tricked-ksl-investigates-some-misleading-claims-from-those-working-to-repeal-prop-4" target="_blank"><u>reportedly been repeatedly misled</u></a> into signing the petition by signature-gatherers, with some telling local news outlets that <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2026/01/31/prop-4-decline-sign-volunteers-gop/" target="_blank"><u>they were told it was an anti-ICE petition</u></a>. Those signature-gatherers have reported <a href="https://www.deseret.com/politics/2026/01/29/utah-republican-signature-gatherers-assaulted-as-national-activist-groups-aim-to-repeal-redistricting-law/" target="_blank"><u>being assaulted</u></a> by hecklers and their signature packets stolen or destroyed.</p> 
<p>In the Beehive State, where politics are often seen by outsiders as cartoonishly friendly, this effort has turned so tumultuous that Republican Gov. Spencer Cox — who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/disagree-better-spencer-cox-stop-hate-00557293" target="_blank"><u>earned national attention for his pleas for civility</u></a> after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was assassinated in the state — <a href="https://x.com/GovCox/status/2017242349081092452" target="_blank"><u>called on Utahns</u></a> to “resolve [their] disagreements peacefully.”</p> 
<p>While the GOP groups insist they’ll have the numbers needed, they’re still far short — which would represent a major failure in a ruby-red state.</p> 
<p>The effort aims to overturn <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/utah-judge-denies-gop-passed-congressional-map-00646183" target="_blank"><u>a new judge-ordered congressional map</u></a> that hands Democrats one safe blue seat by attempting to repeal an anti-gerrymandering law that would allow the Republican-controlled legislature to reinstall a more favorable map ahead of the 2028 elections. It has garnered support from Trump and his allies, who had already spent $4.3 million on the effort as of November — and have only ramped up since.</p> 
<p>The signature-gathering initiative represents an early test of Republicans’ ground-game efforts in a midterm year <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/house-fundraising-midterm-campaign-finance-fec-00759382" target="_blank"><u>where they face strong headwinds</u></a> in the polls.</p> 
<p>Trump and his son, <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1980266166439350277" target="_blank"><u>Donald Trump Jr,</u></a> have signaled support to the Utah initiative, with Trump recently encouraging his Truth Social followers to support the “very important effort” to ”KEEP UTAH RED.”</p> 
<p>Turning Point Action — the 501(c)(4) founded by the late Charlie Kirk, who was killed in the state last summer — is “all in” on the effort, <a href="https://www.deseret.com/politics/2025/12/09/turning-point-action-joins-utah-republican-effort-to-repeal-proposition-4-redistricting-law/" target="_blank">its COO said</a><u>,</u> and is canvassing the state with <a href="https://www.tpaction.com/superchase/ut" target="_blank">a half-dozen events over the next week.</a> A fleet of about 700 paid workers, many of them from out of state, have been hired to gather signatures, bankrolled by Securing American Greatness Inc., a 501(c)(4) previously run <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/31/trump-dark-money-group-00161122" target="_blank">by former Trump White House official Taylor Budowich</a>. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/30/the-maga-celebrity-trying-to-turn-new-jersey-red-in-2025-00235357" target="_blank">MAGA celebrity Scott Presler</a> parachuted in last month for a series of events. And Trump Jr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH8z2DfebdI" target="_blank">cut an 11th-hour ad</a> begging Utah outdoorsmen to protect "their pioneer heritage" by signing the petition at the state's largest hunting expo in Salt Lake City next week. (Trump-loving country singer Ted Nugent, who will attend the expo, will autograph merch for signers.)</p> 
<p>But so far, those efforts don’t appear to be paying off. As of Friday, the initiative had garnered <a href="https://vote.utah.gov/repeal-of-the-independent-redistricting-commission-and-standards-act-direct-initiative-list-of-signers/" target="_blank">just over 76,000 verified signatures</a>, about half of the more than 140,000 required statewide for a measure to be added to this November’s ballot. A daily analysis <a href="https://utahpolitics.news/prop-4-qualifies-in-third-senate-district-but-still-miles-from-the-ballot/" target="_blank">conducted by independent journalist Bryan Schott</a> shows the initiative on track to fall well short of the required signature thresholds: eight percent of all active registered voters statewide, and eight percent in at least 26 of the 29 Utah state Senate districts.</p> 
<p>“The only thing that will matter is on the very last day, do we have enough signatures, and I strongly believe that we will,” said Brad Bonham, a Republican National Committeeman and initiative sponsor.</p> 
<p>The initiative’s Republican backers claim the lagging signature count is part of their strategy. Bonham said the initiative’s sponsors have “many, many thousands of signatures” they are independently verifying and have not yet submitted. Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Axson said “many tens of thousands” more have been submitted to county clerks and are undergoing verification.</p> 
<p>“We feel very, very good about the strategy that we are executing on and the momentum that we're building,” Axson said.</p> 
<p>Dropping a large tranche of signatures close to the February 15 deadline could backfire, said Elizabeth Rasmussen, the executive director of Better Boundaries, the anti-gerrymandering group opposing the repeal, as signers still have a 45-day window after their signature is verified to remove it.</p> 
<p>Rasmussen said her group mailed <a href="https://static.politico.com/b5/46/ca0b5b254bf6b01fe6d8b32b8dad/utah-petition-nonpartisan-english.pdf" target="_blank"><u>nearly 8,000 letters</u></a> last week to petition signers encouraging them to remove their names, and will continue to do so in coming weeks. Her groups’ previous efforts have led to over 500 signatures removed, Rasmussen said.</p> 
<p>And she’s not so sure that Trump’s involvement will help the GOP in a heavily conservative state whose voters nonetheless have long been skeptical of the president.</p> 
<p>“Trump’s approval rating in Utah is at an all-time low,” Rasmussen said. “We’re not seeing that as a value add, if anything.”</p> 
<p>The ongoing saga in Utah is an odd addendum to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/31/the-redistricting-fight-that-dominated-american-politics-in-2025-00703193" target="_blank"><u>the nationwide redistricting push</u></a>. In 2018, Utah voters passed Proposition 4, a ballot measure that created an independent redistricting commission to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Earlier this year, District Judge Dianna Gibson ruled that the GOP-controlled state legislature <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/25/utah-congressional-maps-2026-00524388" target="_blank"><u>failed to comply</u></a> with Prop 4 when it drew four safe Republican districts in the 2022 map. The GOP submitted another map with four safe seats last fall, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/utah-judge-denies-gop-passed-congressional-map-00646183" target="_blank">the judge selected a different map</a>, which includes a blue seat in Salt Lake County, in November.</p> 
<p>The GOP-controlled state legislature is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/utah-redistricting-congressional-map-appeal-00668098" target="_blank"><u>appealing Gibson’s decision</u></a> to the state Supreme Court, and two sitting U.S. House members <a href="https://www.deseret.com/politics/2026/02/02/congressmen-sue-utah-lieutenant-governor-over-new-congressional-map-chosen-by-district-judge-because-violates-us-constitution/" target="_blank"><u>joined a federal lawsuit</u></a> pushing for the current, Republican-friendly map to be used in 2026. The state GOP’s signature-gathering push would repeal Prop 4 and allow the legislature to redraw a map ahead of the 2028 cycle.</p> 
<p>If they meet the requisite signature threshold, the initiative will go on the ballot this November, where voters will decide.</p> 
<p>In Utah County, the state’s second-most-populous county, the clerk’s office has <a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/politics/bogus-efforts-used-to-gain-prop-4-repeal-signatures-called-most-extensive-fraud-that-weve-seen" target="_blank"><u>flagged hundreds of signatures</u></a> for possible fraud. Some appear to be forged signatures, and when the clerk’s office called the signers, they denied ever signing the petition; others appear to be made-up names and addresses.</p> 
<p>“I think it's just the signature gatherers that are doing this are just trying to find an easy way to make money,” Aaron Davidson, the Utah County Clerk, told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>The Salt Lake and Davis county clerks — the first- and third-most populous counties in the state — said they have not seen any significant irregularities. “The number of alleged fraudulent voters that Utah County has found, that is startling,” said Lannie Chapman, the Salt Lake County clerk. “We all take this very seriously.”</p> 
<p>Axson, the GOP state chair, said some of the signature-gatherers under review were flagged by his team before submission, and several paid signature-gatherers who are under review for fraud have been fired. "I don't want a single fraudulent signature counted,” Axson said.</p> 
<p>“Are there going to be a couple of bad actors, or bad examples, or places where the process has fallen short, or whatnot? Of course there are,” added Axson. “But what's not being talked about in all of these stories is the fact that out of 3,000 people engaged in this effort, you only have a small handful of bad actors.”</p> 
<p>But as the signature push enters its home stretch, tensions have only accelerated.</p> 
<p>“Violence is not the answer to any of this. I don't understand anybody that would do that,” added Bonham, the initiative sponsor. “It brings me back to Charlie Kirk losing his life here in our own backyard. It's like, what on earth is going on here?”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the Atlantic, heads are rolling over the Jeffrey Epstein revelations.</p> 
<p>In Norway, one prominent diplomat has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/norway-suspends-celebrated-diplomat-in-epstein-probe" target="_blank">already been suspended</a> and a police investigation <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/former-norway-pm-investigated-corruption-suspicion-over-jeffrey-epstein-files/" target="_blank">has been opened</a> into a former prime minister. In the U.K., the former ambassador to the U.S. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/peter-mandelson-resigns-as-british-ambassador-to-us-over-jeffrey-epstein-friendship/" target="_blank">has been fired</a>; on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/peter-mandelson-built-britains-labour-establishment-now-its-torching-him/" target="_blank">he resigned from the House of Lords</a>. Police are reviewing reports <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/peter-mandelson-appeared-send-uk-government-plans-epstein/" target="_blank">he shared market-sensitive information with Epstein</a>.</p> 
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/prince-andrew-titles-stripped-royal-lodge/" target="_blank">was stripped of his royal titles and residence</a>. A charity founded by his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York, will shut down indefinitely following <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sarah-ferguson-duchess-york-epstein-andrew-b7cd2158ef6bd2ac06ad06e8b2f3dbd5" target="_blank">the release of emails</a> where she called Epstein a “legend” and “the brother I have always wished for.”</p> 
<p>But as Europe’s political class moves to clean up its mess and address its shame concerning ties with the convicted sex offender, it’s inadvertently highlighting something else — the comparative lack of accountability in the U.S.</p> 
<p>No prominent politicians have taken a fall. Consequences have been limited. Wagons have been circled around the most prominent political figures whose names have surfaced in the legal document dumps.</p> 
<p>In the U.K., former ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson — who has said he was wrong to believe Epstein following his conviction and to continue his association with him afterwards — has emerged as a millstone around <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/keir-starmer-apologizes-jeffrey-epstein-victims-for-appointing-peter-mandelson/" target="_blank">British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s neck</a>. While Starmer never actually met Epstein, some are calling for his resignation over his appointment of Mandelson. The prime minister publicly apologized Thursday to Epstein’s victims.</p> 
<p>“I am sorry,” Starmer said. “Sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you, sorry for having believed Mandelson’s lies and appointed him and sorry that even now you’re forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.”</p> 
<p>It’s a different story in the U.S. Donald Trump’s Republican Party has largely averted its eyes or rallied to the president’s defense despite his documented ties to Epstein and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/epstein-files-todd-blanche-photos-00759045" target="_blank">the unverified additional allegations</a> against the president that appeared last week.</p> 
<p>Trump has denied wrongdoing in relation to the Epstein allegations, and no evidence has suggested that he took part in Epstein’s trafficking operation. The president also has maintained that he and Epstein had a falling out years ago.</p> 
<p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick remains unscathed in his Cabinet post. Lutnick said on a podcast last year that he was so disgusted by his neighbor Epstein in 2005 that he vowed to never be in the same room with him again. But when the Justice Department released more than three million pages of materials related to the late American financier last Friday, emails surfaced suggesting a closer relationship and that Lutnick had actually seen Epstein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/howard-lutnick-epstein-island.html" target="_blank">some years later</a> on a trip to Epstein’s Caribbean island. A spokesperson said the Commerce secretary “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/03/lutnick-invited-epstein-hillary-clinton-fundraiser/88494105007/" target="_blank">had limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.</a>” So far, there are no signs it affected his standing in the Trump Cabinet.</p> 
<p>Likewise, Goldman Sachs and its CEO David Solomon have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the company’s general counsel Kathryn Ruemmler as she’s faced brutal headlines for months for her associations with Epstein, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/democrats/oh-my-god-i-am-dying-jeffrey-epstein-showered-obama-white-house-counsel-kathryn-ruemmler-with-gifts-including-9400-hermes-handbag-and-four-seasons-spa-treatment-emails-show/" target="_blank">which include gifts of a $9,400 Hermes bag</a> and a spa treatment at the Four Seasons Hotel in D.C. Solomon <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-ruemmler-epstein-8c8255fd" target="_blank">told the Wall Street Journal</a> several weeks ago that Ruemmler, a former White House counsel to Barack Obama, “is widely respected and admired at the firm.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-ruemmler-epstein-8c8255fd?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcwhGjNvZpfXNrb24oB08Ybr86Ku69B7IO988qXsma5P6VA0Dxh6hb8iMIPCAk%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69864071&amp;gaa_sig=qS3dRhQ1NZox8EuCg4Ft7rp3qPMsqK-6hZZY2Qxkr1eSzzg6c2fKOVgHt1V4U2e4qcbna-ez_R2q6zenF5BlrQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">Ruemmler has said</a> she regrets “ever knowing him, and I have enormous sympathy for the victims of Epstein’s crimes.”</p> 
<p>Even Dr. Peter Attia, the author and influential longevity researcher who is a contributor to CBS News, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2026-02-04/cbs-news-peter-attia-keeps-cbs-news-role-despite-epstein-files-controversy" target="_blank">remains on the job</a> despite his appearance in numerous emails with Epstein, where they discussed female genitalia and how Epstein’s life was “so outrageous.” <a href="https://x.com/PeterAttiaMD/status/2018350892395774116" target="_blank">In an email that he posted on X</a>, Attia apologized and said he was not involved in any criminal activity, his interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone and that he was never on his plane or island, and never present at any sex parties.</p> 
<p>Some see the relatively limited fallout — in a public arena where infidelity or even smoking marijuana were once enough to sink a career — as a reflection of the diminished standards of the Trump era, when the president’s own indiscretions and extreme polarization has led to a greater tolerance of the scent of scandal. They point to the Cabinet nominations of former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, both of whom would have been unthinkable in the past given allegations about their involvement in sex crimes that both men have denied.</p> 
<p>“Some of that has to do with the general chaos on this side of the pond where it’s a never ending stream of scandal emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and Trump has set a tone of defiance on refusal to accept and feel any shame,” said Norm Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic who is now a top Trump critic and the founder of Democracy Defenders Action, a bipartisan group that tracks what it calls “autocratic” behavior by the administration. “Those who should feel shame are hunkering down instead.”</p> 
<p>It’s true that several American figures linked to Epstein have been forced to step away from public life. They include former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/elizabeth-warren-larry-summers-harvard-epstein" target="_blank">who has said</a> he is “deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” and Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/business/brad-karp-paul-weiss-resigns-epstein.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank">resigned as the law firm’s chair on Wednesday</a> saying it’s in the best interest of the firm. David Ross, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/nyregion/epstein-emails-david-ross-school-visual-arts.html" target="_blank">stepped down this week</a> from his position at a Manhattan art school and said in a statement that he felt ashamed for falling for Epstein’s lies. But for many of the best-known elites who were in contact with the late convicted sex offender — including former Trump aide Steve <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-files-bannon-musk-00758613" target="_blank">Bannon and billionaire tech mogul</a> Elon Musk — the only consequence has been the reputational hit.</p> 
<p>“What matters is not release of some subset of the Epstein files, but rather the prosecution of those who committed heinous crimes with Epstein,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-files-bannon-musk-00758613" target="_blank">Musk wrote on X</a>. “When there is at least one arrest, some justice will have been done. If not, this is all performative. Nothing but a distraction.”</p> 
<p>Bannon has said little publicly about their relationship, but he did previously call for an independent investigation into the files.</p> 
<p>Bannon, a frequent visitor to Epstein’s New York house, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bannon-epstein-doc-wolff-1236433536/" target="_blank">was planning a documentary</a> to help revive Epstein’s image and even was texting documentary scheduling questions with Epstein the day he was arrested in 2019. Even so, there are few outward signs that the scandal has touched him: Bannon still does his “War Room” show on Rumble and his political musings are widely covered in the press.</p> 
<p>It’s an approach in keeping with Trump’s own never-concede-an-inch style.</p> 
<p>“We as Americans need to be looking at ourselves in the mirror. Why are we not having that same reaction [as Europe]?” said Rufus Gifford, a former Obama-appointed ambassador to Denmark. “Without a doubt how Trump has acted has filtered down to broader society. But I think the question that we have to ask is whether or not this existed before Trump, and Trump is just a symptom of that larger problem.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American Israel Public Affairs Committee uncorked $2 million to try to sink a mainstream Democrat in a multi-candidate special House election primary in New Jersey — and it’s infuriating mainstream Democrats and some of the pro-Israel lobby’s supporters.</p> 
<p>“It’s pissing people off,” said Steve Schale, a longtime Democratic strategist and former Obama campaign adviser, who described it as “maddening.”</p> 
<p>The organization spent heavily through its super PAC, Unite Democracy Project, to attack former Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a pro-Israel moderate who would not support unconditional aid to Israel. In doing so, it provided an opening to Analilia Mejia, a progressive organizer backed by Bernie Sanders who <a href="https://youtu.be/aQCOQ6R5mok?si=Y5JC0rVICOoIzIee&amp;t=2987" target="_blank"><u>has said Israel committed genocide in Gaza</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Malinowski, who has not conceded the race, now trails Mejia by around 500 votes, with some outstanding votes left to be counted for the affluent, suburban seat.</p> 
<p>AIPAC’s interventions in the New Jersey special election for Democratic Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s House seat was the first test of the group’s muscle ahead of the 2026 primary season, when they are expected to spend millions on Democratic primaries across the country. AIPAC’s super PAC is expected to weigh in on House primaries, starting in Illinois’ March primaries. Democratic candidates and strategists are also bracing for them to potentially wade into contentious Senate primaries in Michigan and Minnesota.</p> 
<p>And their first foray of 2026 backfired spectacularly.</p> 
<p>Matt Bennett, the co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way, called their efforts “one of the greatest own-goals in American political history,” and warned that “It hurt everybody in the moderate movement” as they head into a competitive primary season.</p> 
<p>Even steadfast allies are frustrated. Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), a longtime AIPAC supporter, said its moves in the New Jersey primary, held Thursday, “raised eyebrows this morning.”</p> 
<p>“There’s a chance that it’s not going to be a New Dem that’s in that seat,” Schneider said, referring to the New Democrat Coalition, the centrist caucus he leads in the House. “As we do the analysis, a lot of factors play into that, but certainly any group spending against a candidate that would’ve been a New Dem and instead electing a far-left candidate … Come on, guys, this is not what we were hoping for here.”</p> 
<p>Former Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), another AIPAC supporter who led House Democrats’ campaign efforts in 2012 and 2014, said he “wasn’t privy to AIPAC’s strategy and I certainly wouldn’t have advised it,” but “they are not the first group to make a bet that didn’t pan out on election day.”</p> 
<p>Malinowski said AIPAC’s attacks on him sent a clear message to “other mainstream Democrats.”</p> 
<p>“They are now demanding 100 percent fealty,” Malinowski said. “On some level, they may have preferred to elect an anti-Israel progressive versus a mainstream Democrat, who departs from their hard line in a small way.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for UDP said in a statement shared with POLITICO: “The outcome in NJ-11 was an anticipated possibility, and our focus remains on who will serve the next full term in Congress.” The spokesperson added that UDP will “be closely monitoring dozens of primary races, including the June NJ-11 primary,” which will be held ahead of the November 2026 general election, “to help ensure pro-Israel candidates are elected to Congress.”</p> 
<p>Progressives, meanwhile, took a victory lap. Justice Democrats communications director Usamah Andrabi said AIPAC’s spending in primaries “is becoming a kiss of death” because “of the work our movement has done to expose them.” Mejia told reporters on Friday that she’s “glad that New Jersey 11 voters got to see the terrible tactics so that we could reject it in the future” and denounced AIPAC’s heavy spending.</p> 
<p>Sanders, who rallied for his former adviser Mejia on the eve of the election, said Democrats are starting to realize that "not only is [AIPAC's] policy bad, but it's going to hurt me politically,'" and predicted candidates will start throwing the AIPAC spending back at them.</p> 
<p>"I think you're going to see a lot of candidates saying, 'I'm being attacked by AIPAC. You should vote for me for that reason alone,'" Sanders said. "They’re going to turn it around because AIPAC is increasingly unpopular."</p> 
<p>Much of UDP’s playbook in the New Jersey primary has been deployed by them before — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/25/israel-divide-democratic-primaries-00047625" target="_blank"><u>attacking candidates on issues unrelated to Israel.</u></a> The group hit Malinowski in TV ads for a 2019 vote he took, along with most House Democrats at the time, that, in part, provided funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE funding is a particularly hot-button issue, after President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota led to two fatal shootings of protesters by federal agents.</p> 
<p>There are signs that AIPAC is already getting involved in Illinois. Two super PACs, Elect Chicago Women Now and Affordable Chicago Now, are now supporting three Democrats in House races with six-figure TV ad buys — <a href="https://evanstonnow.com/whos-behind-the-new-super-pac-ads-on-tv/" target="_blank"><u>which some of their primary opponents have publicly accused the groups of shell groups.</u></a></p> 
<p>The super PACs were formed last month, so they have not yet been required to disclose any information yet with the Federal Elections Commission. UDP’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on these super PACs.</p> 
<p>“We’re bracing [for AIPAC's spending], yes, and it is alarming in a cycle where five seats are open, which almost never happens in Illinois,” said a Democratic strategist working on Illinois races, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “AIPAC is actively trying to buy three or possibly four seats.”</p> 
<p>The winner of Thursday’s special primary election in New Jersey will face Joe Hathaway, a Republican councilmember from Randolph, N.J., on April 16, to fill the remainder of Sherrill’s term. Then, Democrats will hold another primary on June 2.</p> 
<p>Though some centrist Democrats fretted that Mejia’s potential victory could hurt their chances to hold on to the seat, pollster Patrick Murray said a Republican victory is highly unlikely, both in the special general election in April or in November.</p> 
<p>“It’s just so anti-Trump now,” he said. “We saw in the 2025 general election that there was more motivation among Democrats than Republicans. And that mood still holds.”</p> 
<p>Of the upcoming primary season, where dark money from an array of outside groups is expected to saturate Democratic primaries, Malinowski called it “a significant challenge to the Democratic Party that needs to be addressed.”</p> 
<p>“My election was the beta test,” he said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump won’t be representing the U.S. at the opening ceremony of the Italian Olympic Games in Milan’s famous San Siro Stadium. But his shadow will surely loom over the two-week-long sporting spectacle, which kicks off Friday.</p> 
<p>The president’s repeated jabs at longtime partners, his inconsistent tariff policy and repeated plays for Greenland have shown just how much he's shifted the traditional world order. The resulting <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/20/carney-trump-davos-great-powers-00736740" target="_blank">international “rupture,” as described by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney</a> in Davos last month, has turned beating the Americans in Italy from a crowning sporting achievement to an even greater moral imperative for the president's rivals.</p> 
<p>“This is life and death,” said Charlie Angus, a former member of Parliament in Canada with the New Democratic Party and prominent Trump critic. “If it’s the semifinals and we’re playing against the United States, it’s no longer a game. And that’s profound.”</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has big plans for these Olympics, according to a State Department memo viewed by POLITICO. It hopes to “promote the United States as a global leader in international sports” and build momentum for what the White House sees as a “Decade of Sport in America,” which will see the country host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2028 and the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2034, as well as the FIFA World Cup this summer.</p> 
<p>But a combative administration may well complicate matters.</p> 
<p>He’s <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/2019414633753506049" target="_blank">sending Vice President JD Vance</a>, a longtime critic of Europe’s leaders, to lead the presidential delegation in Milan. Then there’s ICE. News that American federal immigration agents <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/its-not-like-the-ss-are-coming-italy-quell-ice-furor-winter-olympics/" target="_blank">would be on the ground</a> providing security during the games sparked widespread fury throughout the country.</p> 
<p>Trump has also clashed with many of the countries vying to top the leaderboards in Milan. Since returning to the White House in January, he’s antagonized Norway, which took home the most <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/beijing-2022/medals" target="_blank">medals in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/norway-pm-store-says-us-trump-peace-prize-snub-for-greenland-ambitions/" target="_blank">over a perceived Nobel Peace Prize snub</a> and clashed repeatedly with Canada, which finished fourth.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/e6/0c/9b65401a43dd8d7af4b82b4001e9/france-italy-olympics-ice-hockey-47526.jpg" alt="Italy goalie Gabriella Durante skates before a women's hockey game against France at the Milano Santagiulia ice hockey arena at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, in Milan, on Feb. 5, 2026.

"/><p>“We’re looking at the world in a very different light,” Angus said. “And we’re looking at a next-door neighbor who makes increasingly unhinged threats towards us. So to go to international games and pretend that we’re all one happy family, well, that’s gone.”</p> 
<p>Trump has also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-on-macrons-sunglasses-what-the-hell-happened/" target="_blank">sparred with Emmanuel Macron</a>, the president of France (the 13th-place finisher in Beijing), and threatened a military incursion in pushing Denmark (a Scandinavian country which <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/look-to-the-past-the-three-nations-with-a-single-olympic-winter-games-medal" target="_blank">curiously hasn’t medaled in the Winter Olympics since 1998</a>) to cede Greenland.</p> 
<p>All while seeming to placate Russia, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6991592/2026/01/28/winter-olympics-russians-individual-neutral-athletes/" target="_blank">athletes competed under a neutral flag in 2022 due to doping sanctions</a> and secured the second-most medals in the Beijing games, which ended just days before President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.</p> 
<p>The Olympics have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/5-times-the-winter-olympics-got-political/" target="_blank">long collided with geopolitics</a>, from Russia’s ban in response to its war in Ukraine to <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/why-south-africa-barred-from-the-olympics-apartheid" target="_blank">South Africa’s 32-year-long exclusion</a> as punishment for apartheid. And Beijing’s time in the limelight was marred by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/06/white-house-boycott-beijing-olympics-523817" target="_blank">U.S. diplomatic boycott over China’s treatment of its Uyghur population</a>. </p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Trump’s political agenda of putting America First is paying off.</p> 
<p>“Fairer trade deals are leveling the playing field for our farmers and workers, NATO allies are taking greater responsibility for their own defense, and drugs and criminals are no longer entering our country,” she said. “Instead of taking bizarre vendettas against American athletes, foreign leaders should follow the President’s lead by ending unfettered migration, halting Green New Scam policies, and promoting peace through strength.”</p> 
<p>When reached for comment, the State Department deferred to the White House about the political ramifications of the games. A State Department spokesperson also highlighted the role that its Diplomatic Security Service would serve as the security lead for Americans throughout Olympic and Paralympic competition.</p> 
<p>Hockey, arguably one of the winter Olympic Games’ highest-profile sports, has already been roiled by Trump’s global agenda. Just <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/hockey-trump-canada-tariffs-00002396" target="_blank">look at last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off</a>, which pitted the U.S. and Canada against each other in preliminary play and then again in the final.</p> 
<p>Canadian fans booed the American national anthem mercilessly when the two sides faced off in Montreal. Trump called the U.S. locker room on the morning of the final and showered the Great North with incessant 51st state gibes, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/trudeau-trump-us-canada-hockey-four-nations-final-00205421" target="_blank">then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded boisterously</a> when Canada won the championship in overtime.</p> 
<p>“You can’t take our country — and you can’t take our game,” he wrote.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics-mens-ice-hockey/game/_/gameId/401845676/denmark-united-states" target="_blank">American men’s team will play Denmark</a> in Milan — fittingly — on Valentine’s Day, and could see the Canadians at the medal rounds.</p> 
<p>“I'm sure they'll concentrate on the events they compete in rather than get involved in politics,” Anders Vistisen, a member of the European Parliament from Denmark, said of his compatriots in a statement. “Maybe Trump's antics will give them even more motivation? Who knows?”</p> 
<p>Elsewhere in Italy, Americans Sean Doherty, Maxime Germain, Campbell Wright and Paul Schommer will match up against 2022 champion Quentin Fillon Maillet from France in biathlon throughout the games. And Canadian short track speedskater and medal favorite William Dandjinou will look to hold off multiple Americans at the Milano Ice Skating Arena.</p> 
<p>“With the current American president, no one knows what he will do or say tomorrow,” said legendary goaltender Dominik Hasek, a <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/dominik-hasek" target="_blank">gold medalist with Czechia in the 1998 Nagano Games</a> and a one-time rumored presidential candidate in his home nation. “If he doesn't make negative comments about athletes from other countries in the coming weeks, everything will be fine. But that could change very quickly after one of his frequent hateful attacks.”</p> 
<p>Hasek, a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/44815228/czech-leaders-condemn-russian-threats-dominik-hasek" target="_blank">frequent critic of Putin’s war in Ukraine</a>, said Trump “has antagonized most of the people of the democratic world with his attitudes and actions.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/0e/f4/612fbe49403b9c4c0e5891f7212e/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2251647748" alt="“With the current American president, no one knows what he will do or say tomorrow,” said legendary goaltender Dominik Hasek, a Gold medalist with Czechia in the 1998 Nagano Games." data-portal-copyright="Robert Sullivan/AFP via Getty Images" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="2251647748" data-licensor-name="AFP via Getty Images" data-title="“With the current American president, no one knows what he will do or say tomorrow,” said legendary goaltender Dominik Hasek, a Gold medalist with Czechia in the 1998 Nagano Games."/><p>That doesn’t exactly scream “Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together,” the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/olympic-motto" target="_blank">Olympic motto</a> revamped by the IOC in 2021.</p> 
<p>“It was personal,” Angus, the former Canadian lawmaker, said of the tense Canada-U.S. showdown in the 4 Nations Face-Off last year. “This was deeply personal. We were at the moment of people brawling in the stands, and that was because of Donald Trump and the constant insults. He turned that game into war.”</p> 
<p>But now at the Olympics, the <a href="https://support.olympics.com/hc/en-gb/articles/43002339567763-How-many-countries-will-participate-in-the-Winter-Olympics-2026#:~:text=Milano%20Cortina%202026-,How%20many%20countries%20will%20participate%20in%20the%20Winter%20Olympics%202026,disciplines%20and%20six%20Paralympic%20sports" target="_blank">U.S. is just one of more than 90 nations competing</a>. And Trump’s international critics say they’re determined to not let their anger with Trump ruin the games — if just not to give him the satisfaction.</p> 
<p>“People are done with Donald Trump’s flagrant attempts to goad us and poke at us and insult us,” Angus said. “It’s like water off our back. We’re a much tougher people than we were last year.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia’s state Supreme Court will decide whether state Democrats’ gerrymander push can proceed after an appeals court on Wednesday pushed the case to the high court.</p> 
<p>The state Circuit Court of Appeals, in a motion, stated that the case is of “such imperative public importance as to justify the deviation from normal appellate practice and to require prompt decision in the Supreme Court.”</p> 
<p>The move comes after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/virginia-redistricting-blocked-court-ruling-00750060" target="_blank">a court in Tazewell County last week blocked</a> Virginia Democrats from going forward with gerrymandering, ruling that the Democrat-led Legislature had wrongly approved a constitutional amendment that would allow for mid-decade redrawing of congressional districts ahead of the midterms this fall.</p> 
<p>The move is a potential bright spot for Democrats, who had been stymied by the lower court ruling blocking the party’s attempt to gain upwards of four seats in the midterms through redistricting. Currently, Democrats hold six seats in the state while Republicans control five.</p> 
<p>The Republican-backed group Virginians for Fair Maps, one of the main organizations against redistricting in the state, declined to comment.</p> 
<p>Virginians for Fair Elections, the Democrat-affiliated group launched last month to urge voters to approve the measure, declined to comment on the record.</p> 
<p>Last October, Democratic lawmakers began the process of redrawing maps in the state, an effort that only gained traction after voters elected Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger in the November election and the GOP lost 13 seats in the House of Delegates.</p> 
<p>Virginia Democrats had been so confident prior to the Tazewell County court ruling that party leaders vowed to unveil new maps it wanted Virginia voters to approve by the end of last month, with promises of unveiling a map that goes as far as 10-1 in favor of their party.</p> 
<p>Virginia is seen as the top prize in Democrats’ redistricting push, especially if Republican-led Florida redraws its maps under Gov. Ron DeSantis. More GOP-led states could also move to draw more red-leaning states if the Supreme Court rules to strike down portions of the Voting Rights Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has made his ability to navigate a sharply divided Legislature a core part of his national sales pitch. But as 2028 approaches, what he really wants is a Democratic trifecta in Harrisburg.</p> 
<p>Shapiro helped Democrats flip the state House in 2022 when he won the governor’s mansion. But the Republican-controlled Senate has been his Achilles' heel since, stymieing his attempts to pass core Democratic policies like raising <a href="https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/insights/labor-employment/these-states-have-the-highest-and-lowest-minimum-wages/#lowest-minimum-wage" target="_blank">one of the lowest state minimum wages in the country</a>. And the split Legislature left Shapiro mired in a monthslong budget standoff last year that <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/10/pennsylvania-budget-impasse-county-crisis-layoffs-service-cuts-capitol/#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20counties%20affected%20by%20the,than%20the%20Federal%20Reserve's%20current%20baseline%20rates." target="_blank">held up billions of dollars in state funding</a> for counties, schools and nonprofits.</p> 
<p>Now, Shapiro is leading the charge to help Democrats wrest back the chamber from Republican control by a slim 27-23 majority and expand their single-seat majority in the House — part of an aggressive down-ballot push the governor is undertaking alongside his own reelection bid.</p> 
<p>Shapiro has repeatedly voiced his desire to win unified control of the commonwealth both in private conversations with donors and in public. He’s touted what he could do with it — outlining a policy agenda rooted in increasing affordability that includes raising the state’s minimum wage and boosting energy production, including through renewables.</p> 
<p>When asked his second-term goals and whether he needs unified Democratic control to achieve them, the governor said his record proves “I can bring the Republicans and Democrats together to get stuff done.”</p> 
<p>“There are some things, though, that the Republican Senate has blocked me on that I would like us to be able to get done,” he said at an event in Washington last week. “And certainly, having a trifecta would allow me to do that.”</p> 
<p>During his state budget address Tuesday, Shapiro unloaded on Senate Republicans who’ve stood in the way of his priorities, saying they’ve “refused to act” on raising wages and needling them to “stop making excuses” on advancing <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/policy/2025/01/what-know-about-gov-josh-shapiros-lightning-plan-pa-energy/402665/" target="_blank">his energy plans</a>. His voice ringing with emotion, he accused them of “cowering to … special interests” and “tying justice for abused kids to your pet political projects” over stalling enhanced protections for sexual abuse victims.</p> 
<p>Shapiro’s effort to secure unified control of Harrisburg will serve as a critical test of his coattails in the nation’s largest swing state. And it’s a prerequisite for him to be able to score some big-ticket liberal policy wins he can brag about on a 2028 presidential primary stage that could be jam-packed with governors who already have their own achievements to tout.</p> 
<p>“If he can add to the appeal he already has with things like a higher minimum wage, with other pieces of the puzzle that state government can do to make things more affordable, it just gives his candidacy and his message that extra spark that is missing right now,” said longtime Democratic strategist Pete Giangreco, who worked on Barack Obama’s and Amy Klobuchar’s presidential campaigns but is not working for any likely 2028 contenders.</p> 
<p>But Pennsylvania Democrats haven’t had a trifecta in three decades. And they face a narrow path to achieving it even in a year when national Democrats are bullish on a <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/democrats-2026-midterm-flips-redistricting-data/" target="_blank">blue wave</a>.</p> 
<p>Just half the Pennsylvania Senate is on the ballot this year, and operatives on both sides say the battlefield is even smaller, pointing to a handful of districts in the Philadelphia suburbs through the Lehigh Valley and more rural swaths of the state. Prognosticators <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/handicapping-the-2026-state-legislative-map-a-first-look/" target="_blank">say the Pennsylvania Senate “leans Republican.”</a></p> 
<p>“If you look at the Republican map on who needs to be defeated, it’s a lot of more rural, red areas,” said Pennsylvania-based GOP consultant Josh Novotney. “Nothing’s impossible in such a bad year for Republicans. But it’s going to be tough.”</p> 
<p>But Keystone State Democrats are emboldened by last year’s elections. The party <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/democrats-win-pennsylvania-supreme-court-00633675" target="_blank">swept judicial retention races for the state’s highest court</a> and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/03/special-election-pennsylvania-lancaster-allegheny-house-senate/" target="_blank">flipped a state Senate seat</a> during a special election in a district Democrats said President Donald Trump carried by 15 percentage points in 2024. They’re encouraged by Democratic wins and overperformances across the country over the past year.</p> 
<p>And, top Democrats say, they have Shapiro.</p> 
<p>The governor remains highly popular, with an approval rating that’s <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3933" target="_blank">cracked 60 percent</a> in <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/governor-approval-ratings" target="_blank">some surveys</a>. He’s a fundraising juggernaut who has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/08/shapiro-launches-reelection-pennsylvania-00715593" target="_blank">amassed a $30 million war chest</a> to unload against likely GOP rival Stacy Garrity, the state treasurer, who raised just a fraction of that amount.</p> 
<p>Democrats rode to power in the Pennsylvania House in 2022 on what <a href="https://x.com/RepBradford/status/2015576224521752678?s=20" target="_blank">one top lawmaker described as “Shapiro’s landslide coattails,”</a> and they credit the governor for helping them hold their razor-thin majority in 2024, even as Trump won Pennsylvania and Democrats lost every statewide election.</p> 
<p>“He is a huge part of the reason we have the majority. He’s a huge part of the reason that we were able to hold the majority in 2024,” said state Rep. Mike Schlossberg, the House majority whip. “I have no doubt he will lean in very, very heavily to making sure that we not only expand our majority in the House, but hopefully take control of the Senate — something that’s realistically in play for the first time probably in my entire career.”</p> 
<p>Shapiro poured $1.25 million into the Pennsylvania House Democrats’ campaign committee in 2024 and helped raise another $1 million toward defending their majority that year. He also donated $250,000 to state Senate Democrats’ campaign committee. And he cut ads and hit the campaign trail in key legislative districts.</p> 
<p>Last year, Shapiro gave the state party $250,000 to fund infrastructure improvements heading into the midterms, with a promise of more to come. His political team is in “regular communication” with Pennsylvania Democrats’ campaign arms, said state Sen. Vincent Hughes, a Philadelphia Democrat who chairs the party’s Senate campaign committee.</p> 
<p>The governor’s political operation declined to share an estimate of how much Shapiro plans to spend down-ticket this year, or where he plans to campaign. Manuel Bonder, a spokesperson for Shapiro, said the governor “has a long track record of working to elect Democrats up and down the ballot” and will “continue to focus on” that alongside his reelection bid.</p> 
<p>Shapiro and his allies have <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/08/septa-cuts-josh-shapiro-transit-funding-senate-republican-plan-capitol/#:~:text=Shapiro%20added%20that%20he%20thinks,the%20good%20people%20of%20Pennsylvania.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">repeatedly lamented</a> Republican roadblocks to an agenda that includes raising wages, boosting housing and energy production and securing sustainable funding for public transportation. House Speaker Joanna McClinton, a Philadelphia Democrat, accused the GOP of “political gamesmanship” in an interview, claiming the opposition is trying to “keep down the productivity” to hurt Shapiro and state Democrats in 2026 and beyond.</p> 
<p>Senate Republican leaders signaled more friction to come as they fired back on several fronts after Shapiro’s speech Tuesday, skewering his plan to overhaul the state’s energy sector, accusing him of being “more interested in the political talking point” on hiking wages to $15 an hour (while indicating they’re open to compromise) and saying there are “different paths” to helping victims of abuse.</p> 
<p>As 2028 looms, Democratic legislative leaders and political strategists acknowledged the potential political benefit of a trifecta for Shapiro, who could get a boost from both turning a purple state blue and passing policies that could pad a potential presidential platform.</p> 
<p>“If he can help us win the trifecta, and then use it to actually govern and get good results — or as he likes to say, ‘get shit done’ — that looks really good at the national level,” Schlossberg said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s pick to succeed him in the state Assembly cruised to an easy victory Tuesday night. But Diana Moreno’s win in that Queens special election is likely the last cakewalk we’ll see from a Mamdani-backed candidate in the near future.</p> 
<p>The new mayor has endorsed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/brad-lander-set-to-challenge-rep-dan-goldman-from-the-left-00682619" target="_blank">Brad Lander in his quest</a> to unseat Rep. Dan Goldman in New York’s 10th Congressional District and Assemblymember Claire Valdez for the NY-07 seat being vacated by Rep. Nydia Velázquez.</p> 
<p>The pair of Democratic congressional primaries is expected to be far more competitive than Moreno’s race, raising a central question: How far can a Mamdani endorsement get you?</p> 
<p>“We’re testing that out,” said Grace Mausser, co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America’s New York City chapter, which has endorsed both Moreno and Valdez, but not Lander. “He has a lot of hard resources that come with an endorsement: his impressive volunteer and donor lists, his strong reach on social media … There’s also the soft power that we’re testing out now, right? Who is the leader of left and progressive politics in New York right now?”</p> 
<p>Mamdani has so far been more involved in boosting Valdez than Lander.</p> 
<p>The mayor appeared with Valdez — a Queens lawmaker, former United Auto Workers union organizer and the first elected official to stand with Mamdani in his campaign for mayor — at an event the day after she launched her bid. He also filmed a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUBCgnIDvpH/" target="_blank">whimsical social media video</a> set in a subway station to boost her fundraising.</p> 
<p>Valdez is running <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/nyregion/reynoso-velazquez-dsa-congress.html" target="_blank">against Antonio Reynoso,</a> the Brooklyn borough president who Velázquez has endorsed as her preferred successor. Queens City Council Member Julie Won also recently entered the race in the progressive Brooklyn and Queens district.</p> 
<p>The mayor has been largely hands-off in Lander’s campaign after endorsing the former city comptroller on the day of his launch for Congress. Lander, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/13/mamdani-lander-cross-endorsing-mayor-00405357" target="_blank">who cross-endorsed Mamdani</a> in last year’s mayoral race, is running in Brooklyn and Manhattan against an incumbent with more than three times as much campaign cash on hand and the backing of Democratic House leadership, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p> 
<p>A political adviser to Mamdani said his team is still assessing how much to get involved in the two congressional contests and cautioned against reading anything into the fact that the mayor has been more involved in Valdez’s race so far. The adviser said the Mamdani team is waiting to make major moves in NY-10 pending the outcome of a court case that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/new-york-judge-sides-with-democrats-on-redistricting-case-threatening-gop-control-of-staten-island-00740171" target="_blank">could scramble the lines</a> of the district in such a way that Goldman may run in the neighboring 11th District instead.</p> 
<p>Regardless, the Mamdani adviser, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said the mayor simply lending his name to Lander and Valdez “already carries a lot of weight that these campaigns can make the most of.”</p> 
<p>“His direct involvement is always going to be second to governing,” said the aide. “Ninety-nine percent of his energy is going to be focused on running the city.”</p> 
<p>The politics-versus-governance balance is part of Mamdani’s clash with Velázquez, the highly respected progressive who effectively warned him in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/nyregion/nydia-velazquez-antonio-reynoso-mamdani.html" target="_blank">a New York Times interview</a> to stay in his lane.</p> 
<p>And the mayor does have a lot of work to do at the helm of the country’s largest city. June’s congressional primaries fall around the same time he and the City Council will be putting finishing touches on the city budget amid <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/mamdani-ratchets-up-tax-the-rich-rhetoric-as-hochul-launches-a-reelection-run-00753931" target="_blank">serious fiscal headwinds.</a></p> 
<p>“I don’t know if that was the wisest thing for him to do because the job of being mayor is so big,” Democratic strategist Lupe Todd-Medina said, arguing Mamdani could end up in a situation where he's not able to stump for Lander and Valdez as much as they want and need him to due to the sheer burden of governing New York City. </p> 
<p>As June's primaries still loom more than four months away, a Lander campaign official, granted anonymity to share sensitive considerations, said his team is also still waiting to see if <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/new-york-judge-sides-with-democrats-on-redistricting-case-threatening-gop-control-of-staten-island-00740171" target="_blank">a court decision could rip up the lines of NY-10</a>.</p> 
<p>But if the race ends up competitive, the Lander aide said his team is confident Mamdani will help fundraise and campaign for the former comptroller. The fact that Mamdani hasn’t done so yet, the aide said, is understandable since the mayor has been focused on governing in his first month in office.</p> 
<p>The two House primaries have different dynamics but they’ll determine whether Mamdani can replicate the magic that catapulted him from relative obscurity to the nation’s second toughest job.</p> 
<p>“He has a lot at stake by pushing in some chips on two fronts, but I think he has more at stake in the 7th District,” said Michael Lange, an analyst who specializes in progressive politics. Valdez “is a really close ally who comes from his political movement and his political home.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats are launching a new program Wednesday to try to reach voters in their corner who opted to stay home in 2024 instead of voting against then-candidate Donald Trump, as the party continues its search for its identity in the second Trump era.</p> 
<p>The Democratic National Committee program — details of which were shared first with POLITICO — targets over a million voters they view as likely Democrats in battleground House districts who voted in 2020 but didn’t vote four years later.</p> 
<p>The large-scale voter contact operation called “Local Listeners” is a tacit acknowledgement of one of the ways Democrats fell short in 2024, when then-Vice President Kamala Harris failed to engender enough enthusiasm from likely Democrats frustrated with the Biden administration’s economic agenda and its handling of the war between Israel and Hamas.</p> 
<p>“We didn’t lose to Donald Trump. We lost to the couch,” DNC Deputy Executive Director Libby Schneider said in an interview. “We saw our voters, many of our important voters, stay home. Obviously, that is a trend that cannot continue.”</p> 
<p>A key element of the strategy, according to the party, will be training volunteers to engage infrequent voters with a “listening first” approach that prioritizes “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics.”</p> 
<p>Part of President Donald Trump’s winning strategy included engaging with unlikely voters his campaign identified as being potential Republicans. Trump aggressively courted people who had skipped previous elections, focusing predominantly on young men, and ultimately defeated Harris among <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/26/2024-election-turnout-trum-00426544" target="_blank">voters who skipped</a> the previous midterm and presidential elections.</p> 
<p>“If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement. “The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters — these conversations need to happen early and often.”</p> 
<p>Rima Mohammad, an executive board member of the Michigan Democratic Party and a former delegate who represented the “Uncommitted” movement at the Democratic convention in 2024, said she welcomed the attempts to engage voters who remain disenchanted by Democrats.</p> 
<p>“I saw the level of disengagement, the frustration from people about the party, starting with Gaza and now with what's happening now with ICE, what's happening with all these corporate Dems,” Mohammad — who said she ultimately did support Harris — said in an interview.</p> 
<p>“I'm glad that the DNC is doing this. I don't know if it's too late. I think that work should have happened right after Kamala lost,” she added.</p> 
<p>Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, co-founder of liberal donor group Way To Win, said the DNC’s push to win back unreliable voters is supported by her group’s December <a href="https://waytowin.docsend.com/view/e3nfk8hegk97mktb" target="_blank">analysis of the party’s shortcomings</a> in 2024 and the lessons that can be learned ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>“They weren’t uninformed, right?” Ancona said of potential Harris voters who stayed home. “They just didn't like what they heard. So that's why I feel like it's so important for any engagement plan to recognize how kind of burned and cynical these voters are.”</p> 
<p>The outreach to 2024 skippers marks one of the few public strategy shifts acknowledging the roots of Democrats’ electoral defeat to Trump, following a year of heated internal debate over the direction of the party. In December, the DNC announced it would not be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/dnc-kills-its-own-public-2024-autopsy-00697403" target="_blank">publicly releasing an autopsy report</a> diagnosing the causes of the party’s losses, in part to redirect focus to Democrats’ electoral victories in 2025.</p> 
<p>Schneider said the outreach to voters who stayed home in 2024 is an extension of the introspection party organizers undertook following Trump’s victory.</p> 
<p>“The work started immediately after we lost, and it was sort of a self-reflection of ... what can we do differently and what is within our control?” she said. "This is one of those things that it's a no-brainer that it should live with the DNC, and that we should have been doing it for a lot longer.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans are in full-out panic mode over their plunging support with Hispanic voters after losing a special election in a ruby-red Texas district over the weekend.</p> 
<p>On Saturday, a Democrat posted a 14-point victory in a Fort Worth-based state senate district President Donald Trump had won by 17 points in 2024, a staggering swing that was powered by significant shifts across the district’s Hispanic areas.</p> 
<p>It's the clearest sign yet that the GOP’s newfound coalition that propelled Trump’s return to the White House may be short-lived. Many Republicans are warning the party needs to change course on immigration, focus on bread-and-butter economic issues and start pouring money into competitive races — or risk getting stomped in November.</p> 
<p>Polling already showed that Republicans were rapidly losing support from Hispanic voters. But the electoral results were a confirmation of that drop.</p> 
<p>“It should be an eye-opener to all of us that we all need to pick up the pace,” U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, a Republican from a majority-Hispanic district in South Texas, said in an interview. “The candidate has to do their part, the party has to do their part. And then those of us in the arena, we have to do our part to help them as well.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told reporters Tuesday that the election was a “very concerning outcome.” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick <a href="https://x.com/DanPatrick/status/2017858075932217719" target="_blank">posted on X that the results should be a</a> “wake-up call for Republicans across Texas. Our voters cannot take anything for granted.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said “a swing of this magnitude is not something that can be dismissed.”</p> 
<p>Taylor Rehmet, the Democrat who flipped the state Senate seat over the weekend, made huge gains with Hispanic voters amid national pushback to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics and widespread economic frustration across demographic groups.</p> 
<p>Ahead of the election, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott — an immigration hardliner who bused migrants to Democratic-led cities during the Biden administration — said the White House needed to “recalibrate” on its immigration crackdowns following the shooting of Alex Pretti by an immigration officer in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>“That imagery coming out of Minnesota in the last few days has had a huge impact on not only Hispanic voters, but swing voters, independents in Texas and around the country,” said Texas GOP consultant Brendan Steinhauser. “What's transpired there has definitely led to a bit of a political backlash.”</p> 
<p>As Republicans panic, Democrats are feeling a renewed jolt of optimism after they swept statewide races last year in Virginia and New Jersey. They believe they found a winning formula with Rehmet, whose working-class biography as a union leader, Air Force veteran and Lockheed Martin machinist resonated with voters, along with his narrow focus on local issues like maintaining public school funding.</p> 
<p>Tory Gavito, president of Democratic donor network Way to Win, said she received excited texts from several major donors over the weekend after the win. “Knowing it's a wave year, this just adds a little bit of more wind in our sails,” she said. “It's not just a question around Texas, it's a question around Texas and Mississippi and Alabama and what does this mean for lots of places.”</p> 
<p>Texas Republicans have the most to worry about of any in their party about a major Hispanic snapback towards Democrats.</p> 
<p>Hispanics are now the largest ethnic group in Texas, making up 40 percent of the population. Trump carried Latinos in the state in 2024, exit polls showed, a massive swing from earlier elections, and Republicans had been making especially strong gains with rural, more conservative Hispanic voters in the Rio Grande Valley. But as Texas Democrats look to win a U.S. Senate election for the first time since 1988, they’re eyeing an opportunity to pull those voters back in.</p> 
<p>“They are leaving in droves and going in the opposite direction,” said Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Business Council. “This is a warning sign.”</p> 
<p>And Texas Republicans also banked on retaining at least some of their newfound Hispanic support when they redrew their Congressional map last year, creating several majority-Hispanic districts that Trump would have carried by double digits last year. That includes rejiggering district lines for two top GOP targets, Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, as well as a third district outside San Antonio.</p> 
<p>“They've banged three of these five new Republican seats on a demographic that Democrats were never able to turn out for 30-40 years, " said GOP consultant and Trump critic Mike Madrid, referring to young, Hispanic male voters. But now, Trump’s hardline immigration policies have “angered and upset them.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro appeared to walk back a previous threat to arrest anyone who brings a gun to Washington amid an uproar from Second Amendment groups.</p> 
<p>The backtrack came after Pirro’s initial comments sparked fierce criticism from GOP members of Congress and gun rights advocates. It’s the latest in a series of statements from the administration that have rankled many in the party’s pro-Second Amendment base.</p> 
<p>“I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else — you bring a gun into this district, count on going to jail, and hope you get the gun back” Pirro said during a Monday appearance on Fox News, where she previously hosted the show “Justice with Judge Jeanine.”</p> 
<p>But less than 24 hours later, Pirro attempted to reframe her earlier comments, writing in a social media post that she is “a proud supporter of the Second Amendment.”</p> 
<p>“Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community,” she wrote in <a href="https://x.com/JudgeJeanine/status/2018681644337500637" target="_blank">a Tuesday morning post on X</a>. “We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.”</p> 
<p>She also referenced the response in <a href="https://x.com/JudgeJeanine/status/2018711681153597756?s=20" target="_blank">a video posted to her social media page</a>, acknowledging that “some people are concerned about something I said yesterday” before further clarifying her position.</p> 
<p>The conservative National Association for Gun Rights swiftly came out in opposition to Pirro’s stance, <a href="https://x.com/gunrights/status/2018449837117563183" target="_blank">calling her remarks</a> “unacceptable and intolerable comments by a sitting US attorney.”</p> 
<p>Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, one of the administration’s most frequent critics in the House GOP Conference, <a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2018696857048776767" target="_blank">also denounced Pirro</a>, writing on social media: “Why is a ‘conservative’ judge threatening to arrest gun owners?” Reps. Greg Steube (R-Fla.), Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) criticized the U.S. attorney, too, and <a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/2018680205120819486" target="_blank">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said</a> “Second Amendment rights are not extinguished just because an American visits DC.”</p> 
<p>Washington does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states, and local law requires all firearms in the district to be registered with local police.</p> 
<p>John Commerford, executive director of the National Rifle Association's legislative arm, said Pirro's remarks "highlight the need for Congress to pass <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_38?q=h.r.+38" target="_blank">H.R. 38</a>, the National Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act." That bill, introduced last year by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), would allow anyone with a state-issued concealed carry license to carry a firearm in any other state.</p> 
<p>"Law-abiding citizens' right to self-defense should not end simply because they crossed a state line or entered Washington, D.C.," Commerford said in a statement to POLITICO.</p> 
<p>The backlash to Pirro’s comments comes as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/gun-rights-groups-blast-trump-over-minnesota-response-00748217" target="_blank">the Trump administration faces uproar</a> from Second Amendment advocates for its rhetoric following the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>Just days after the fatal shooting, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/trump-pretti-shouldnt-have-been-carrying-a-gun-00750241" target="_blank">criticized Pretti for carrying a firearm</a>, saying: “I don’t like that he had a gun.”</p> 
<p>Other members of the administration also disparaged Pretti, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt contending that carrying a weapon raises “the assumption of risk” during interactions with law enforcement and FBI Director Kash Patel saying “you cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want.”</p> 
<p>Those remarks triggered fury from Second Amendment groups like the NRA, which <a href="https://x.com/NRA/status/2015227627464728661" target="_blank">called federal prosecutor Bill Essayli’s response</a> to the shooting “dangerous and wrong.” The rhetoric has also fueled concern that the administration could be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/31/2nd-amendment-advocates-issue-dire-warning-over-trumps-pretti-gun-remarks-00758740" target="_blank">harming the GOP’s chances</a> of defending its slim majority in Congress in this fall’s midterm elections.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general is investigating use of force by ICE agents, according to a letter sent to the watchdog by congressional Democrats.</p> 
<p>The probe comes as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/white-house-reckons-with-gop-backlash-after-federal-agents-kill-a-second-person-in-minneapolis-00746737" target="_blank">faces intense scrutiny</a> over its nationwide immigration crackdown, which has at times turned violent in recent weeks, sparking concern from a bipartisan group of lawmakers.</p> 
<p>The letter, sent Monday to DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, cites the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis last month. The letter says the inspector general launched a review on Jan. 8 of the tactics undertaken by ICE and Customs and Border Protection, urging the watchdog to speed up the timeline of the probe.</p> 
<p>“Given the urgency of this situation — with communities facing severe, and sometimes fatal, harm from ICE’s tactics on American streets every day — we request that your office conduct this review expeditiously and share any preliminary findings with Congress and the public on an expedited basis,” the Democrats wrote, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-240c-df17-afbf-7d3f17b40000" target="_blank">a copy of the letter</a> reviewed by POLITICO.</p> 
<p>Democratic Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey — who led the letter along with Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) and Lou Correa (D-Calif.) — first requested the probe in June.</p> 
<p>Thirty-six of their colleagues across the House and Senate signed on to the letter, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/politics/democrats-ice-watchdog-use-force-inquiry.html" target="_blank">first reported by The New York Times</a>.</p> 
<p>The inspector general’s office is conducting an “audit of ICE’s Processes for Investigating and Addressing Allegations of Excessive Use of Force,” per the office’s <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/reports/ongoing-projects?order=field_project_publish_date&amp;sort=desc" target="_blank">list of ongoing projects</a>.</p> 
<p>The probe seeks to “determine whether ICE investigates allegations of excessive use of force and holds personnel accountable in accordance with applicable Federal laws, DHS policies, and ICE directives.”</p> 
<p>Spokespeople for the inspector general’s office and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the probe.</p> 
<p>The lawmakers asked the watchdog to prioritize its review in light of the fact that the office routinely misses its own goal of completing audits within 397 days, according to <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-26-107341.pdf" target="_blank">a January report</a> from the Government Accountability Office.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to soften its approach to immigration enforcement in recent weeks, with Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/democratic-house-leaders-kristi-noem-impeachment-00749643" target="_blank">threatening to impeach</a> DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/29/senators-block-funding-package-amid-dhs-standoff-00754927" target="_blank">withhold funding for the department</a> over its aggressive tactics.</p> 
<p>In a move seen widely as <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/26/congress/tom-homan-gop-support-00746206" target="_blank">an attempt to tamp down tensions</a> in Minnesota, the White House pulled Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino from the state and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/trump-border-czar-minneapolis-00746125" target="_blank">dispatched border czar Tom Homan</a> to Minneapolis last week.</p> 
<p>Following meetings between Homan and Democratic leaders in the state, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/02/ice-cbp-minneapolis-body-cameras-00760996" target="_blank">Noem announced on Monday</a> that ICE and CBP officers in the city will begin wearing body cameras during immigration enforcement operations there — a key demand from congressional Democrats in their push for reforms of the agencies.</p> 
<p>And White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller — a central figure in the administration's immigration enforcement campaign — conceded that CBP agents <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/stephen-miller-cbp-alex-pretti-00751583" target="_blank">may not have been following protocol</a> during the fatal shooting of Pretti, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/doj-investigation-pretti-shooting-minnesota-00757544" target="_blank">which is under review</a> by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and DHS.</p> 
<p>Still, President Donald Trump has aimed to downplay the shift in strategy, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/trump-downplays-changes-in-minnesota-amid-uproar-over-shootings-00750613" target="_blank">rebuffing suggestions that his administration is retreating</a> from its aggressive deportation operation last week and continuing to disparage Pretti.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Increasingly violent threats toward and harassment of public officials — from county clerks up to the president — are driving more and more of those figures out of their jobs, a particular concern among local election officials, who have struggled with attrition for years.</p> 
<p>In the years since the 2020 election, roughly 50 percent of top local election officials across 11 western states have left their jobs since November 2020, <a href="https://issueone.org/articles/turning-the-tide-on-turnover/" target="_blank">according to a new report from Issue One</a>, a bipartisan organization that tracks election issues and supports campaign finance reforms.</p> 
<p>The election administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/10/election-officials-exhausted-under-threat-00015850" target="_blank">world has been grappling</a> with <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2023/06/14/election-officials-sound-the-alarm-about-violence-against-poll-workers-00102041" target="_blank">a significant brain drain</a> since the one-two punch of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/16/election-workers-mass-retirements-494790" target="_blank">2020 pandemic and threats arising</a> from conspiracy theories surrounding that year’s election. But the new report — which focuses on election offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — is particularly concerning because it shows departures haven’t tapered off, marking a 10 percentage point uptick since <a href="https://issueone.org/articles/the-high-cost-of-high-turnover/" target="_blank">the group’s 2023 report</a> survey.</p> 
<p>The new data on election officials comes at the same time as another report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue — <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/tick-tock-traitor-the-rise-of-violent-rhetoric-targeting-us-public-officials/" target="_blank">shared first with POLITICO</a> — found a more than 200 percent increase in violent rhetoric toward public officials when comparing Oct. 2021 to Sept. 2022 with Oct. 2024 to Sept. 2025.</p> 
<p>Taken together, the two reports portend a potentially bleak future for an American democracy that counts on its engaged citizenry to do everything from count votes to make laws.</p> 
<p>“There's a real problem here,” Institute for Strategic Dialogue CEO Sasha Havlicek told POLITICO, adding that violent rhetoric online is increasingly becoming normalized and accepted. “People feel emboldened to speak in certain ways because of the anonymity of online environments that perhaps wouldn't mirror the way that they behave in their daily lives.”</p> 
<p>Election officials across the country are taking notice and are taking new levels of precaution to protect themselves and their staff. </p> 
<p>“It definitely raises some concerns when people are using threatening and violent language and know where I live. And it just takes one, right?” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat <a href="https://nbcmontana.com/news/nation-world/maine-secretary-of-state-says-shes-been-doxed-after-standing-up-to-ice" target="_blank">who recently faced doxxing and death threats</a> after she paused undercover license plate requests for ICE agents in Maine, told POLITICO last week.</p> 
<p>The threats are not limited to members of a particular party. In fact, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found in its report that “Republican leaders, particularly President [Donald] Trump, were disproportionately targeted,” by violent rhetoric and threats.</p> 
<p>The July 2024 failed assassination attempt targeting Trump led to a rapid uptick in threats online, according to ISD’s report. And it hasn’t slowed much since.</p> 
<p>Republicans have seen a 364 percent uptick in threats online in the time period ISD studied, a number that “far outpaced” the 124 percent increase for Democrats.</p> 
<p>Despite repeated calls to tamp down violent rhetoric in the wake of events like Trump’s assassination attempt, there’s often an opposite effect, Havlicek said. “Instead of inspiring some sense of compassion or a deescalation, they do the opposite,” Havlicek said. “Those acts of violence in the real world really push much much more [online] activity in this violent direction, which is quite depressing.”</p> 
<p>Taken together, the uptick in violent threats coupled with election officials leaving their posts is worrying elected officials.</p> 
<p>“I'm always concerned when people feel like their personal safety is at risk, and when they can't stand to do a job that they want to do anymore because of circumstances outside of that job, that sucks,” Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>The turnover among election officials is especially high in competitive areas that are subject to the most scrutiny, per Issue One’s report.</p> 
<p>Across the West, 80 percent “of counties with close margins in the 2020 presidential election have experienced turnover among their chief local election officials,” while just 40 percent of counties with a margin of 50 percent or more saw turnover.</p> 
<p>It’s a problem election officials have long tried to quell. Many officials say that while the departure of longtime officials is concerning, there has been a next generation of workers willing to step up. </p> 
<p>In Arizona, where all 15 of the state’s counties have experienced turnover from top election officials since 2020, according to Issue One’s report, Fontes said he <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2025/06/09/arizona-election-administration-fellowship-program-adrian-fontes/" target="_blank">is using a fellowship program</a> to bring new blood into election administration.</p> 
<p>“Instead of just kind of only being concerned, we're actually doing stuff about it,” he said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tense Texas Democratic Senate primary has been roiled by yet another online firestorm after an influencer accused state Rep. James Talarico of calling a former opponent a “mediocre Black man” — a claim he said was a “mischaracterization of a private conversation.”</p> 
<p>The influencer, Morgan Thompson, who posts under the username @morga_tt on TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morga_tt/video/7602078773206338847" target="_blank">posted the accusation in a video</a> Sunday in which she claimed that Talarico told her in a private conversation after a Jan. 12 town hall in Plano, Texas, that he had “signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.” That reference was allegedly to former Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), who was in the Senate race until December, when he dropped out right before Rep. Jasmine Crockett joined. Both Allred and Crockett are Black; Talarico is white.</p> 
<p>Talarico pushed back on Thompson’s description of their conversation.</p> 
<p>“In my praise of Congresswoman Crockett, I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre – but his life and service are not. I would never attack him on the basis of race,” Talarico said in the statement.</p> 
<p>Thompson <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morga_tt/video/7602154339192360222" target="_blank">said in a video Monday</a> that she has no recording of the conversation but laid out evidence that she had been in contact with Talarico’s campaign to arrange it, including a photo of her standing with Talarico at the event, along with multiple texts she says were exchanged with an unnamed campaign staffer to plan the interaction. She had endorsed Talarico but said she now supports Crockett.</p> 
<p>In an interview with POLITICO before Talarico issued his statement, Thompson said she anticipated that not having a recording of the conversation with Talarico would raise skepticism of her account, but she still “felt like it was important enough to bring forward, given the nature of everything.” She declined to provide the name and contact information for that staffer so that POLITICO could verify their connection to the campaign.</p> 
<p>The alleged exchange threatens to upend a primary <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/15/talarico-crockett-texas-senate-primary-poll-00730929" target="_blank">in which polls show voters are sharply dividing along racial lines</a>, <a href="https://texaspublicopinionresearch.substack.com/p/they-all-want-to-win-new-poll-shows" target="_blank">with most Black voters supporting Crockett</a>, and majorities of white and Latino voters supporting Talarico.</p> 
<p>Allred fired back. “James, if you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don't do it while also tearing down a Black man,” he said in <a href="https://x.com/ColinAllredTX/status/2018384625899294820" target="_blank">a video he posted</a> to Instagram on Monday.</p> 
<p>“When you make an accusation, you often have a bit of confession in it,” continued Allred, who is now running for Congress in the 33rd District against Rep. Julie Johnson (D-Texas). “Maybe you use the word mediocre because there was something creeping into your mind about yourself.”</p> 
<p>Crockett, in a statement, said that by posting his response video, Allred “drew a line in the sand.”</p> 
<p>“He made it clear that he did not take allegations of an attack on him as simply another day in the neighborhood, but more importantly, his post wasn’t about himself,” she said. “It was a moment that he decided to stand for all people who have been targeted and talked about in a demeaning way as our country continues to be divided.”</p> 
<p>Thompson said in the video that she had been offered the chance to talk to Talarico because she was unhappy that Talarico’s campaign had sent out fundraising messages from Democratic strategist James Carville given Carville’s calls for Democrats to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/opinion/democrats-platform-economic-rage.html" target="_blank">move away from “woke” politics</a>. She had previously endorsed Talarico and said she worked with his campaign as part of its content creator outreach program but now supports Crockett.</p> 
<p>It’s the latest online explosion related to the primary. Last month, the hosts of popular podcast “Las Culturistas” urged people not to send money to Crockett because she had a history of “making it too obviously about” herself, a comment from host Matt Rogers that cohost Bowen Yang agreed with. That some of her supporters said the remarks were racist and misogynist, setting off off a fierce debate about what type of Democratic candidate can do well in red states like Texas. The hosts later apologized.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Allred, Sandhya Raghavan, said in a statement that his response to Talarico’s alleged remarks “speaks to a frustration that resonates far beyond this moment.”</p> 
<p>“When a former NFL player, civil rights attorney, and former congressman can be dismissed as ‘mediocre,’ it reveals the impossible standards Black candidates are held to,” she said. “Colin refused to accept that disrespect in silence — and in doing so, he stood up for every Black professional who has had their qualifications unfairly dismissed.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Bongino’s first show back on Monday, President Donald Trump briefly dialed in, offering Bongino — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/dan-bongino-fbi-resignation-00696112" target="_blank">who resigned from the agency in December</a> — well wishes.</p> 
<p>But otherwise, the episode was more of a two-hour monologue that saw Bongino attempting to skewer old enemies — namely the mainstream media — and reconnect with the masses that launched his name, years ago, into the MAGA stratosphere.</p> 
<p>“The podfather is back,” he declared, “and I’m here to take back this movement.”</p> 
<p>Before joining the FBI last year, Bongino was a prolific right-wing podcaster who peddled in deep-state <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/dan-bongino-election-fraud-messaging-437164" target="_blank">conspiracy theories</a>. As the agency’s No. 2, working alongside the real-world powers he used to rail against, Bongino was often caught between his past digital footprint and his new job helping lead one of the nation’s premier law enforcement agencies. </p> 
<p>For years, he entertained <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/30/nx-s1-5407856/conspiracy-theorists-dan-bongino-epstein-fbi" target="_blank">conspiracies about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s</a> death, dismissing the authorities’ claims that the late financier killed himself. Bongino built a fanbase by stoking these very fires — and angered many when, after joining the FBI, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/11/fbi-patel-bongino-epstein-files-00400434" target="_blank">he swiftly backtracked his rhetoric</a>. Online, some of Bongino’s former supporters have slammed him as a sellout.</p> 
<p>The show was a big moment for Bongino, whose tenure at the FBI was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/dan-bongino-weighs-resigning-fbi-heated-confrontation-pam-bondi-epstei-rcna218388" target="_blank">at times chaotic</a>. The show’s launch <a href="https://x.com/dbongino/status/2018409834249331010" target="_blank">included a Times Square billboard</a>, and opened with around 140,000 viewers — according to conservative video platform Rumble’s view count — and peaked at around 220,000.</p> 
<p>After a victory lap around the nation’s top law enforcement agency, Bongino is not returning to the friendliest audience. And he had some choice words for any critics.</p> 
<p>“I want to address the grifters out there who mistakenly thought I wasn’t coming back,” he said during the livestream. “This movement’s been hijacked by a small group of dipshits and bums and losers, who are nothing but doomers under the frame of accountability.”</p> 
<p>This was the throughline for much of the two-hour segment, which saw Bongino ripping into a number of his critics. “Get your lips and just pucker them up and plant a big wet one on my ass,” he told “the libs and their media pals.”</p> 
<p>The “dipshits” in media, he said, remain “totally divorced from reality.”</p> 
<p>And to alleged leakers at the FBI: “You guys destroyed the place, and you tried to destroy us too,” he said. “But I’m back now, and you can go fuck yourself.”</p> 
<p>Bongino, exhaling at the end of his minutes-long diatribe, smiles into the camera: “We’re so back. Aren’t we?”</p> 
<p>But unlike the first version of his podcast, Bongino largely shied away from conspiracy theories — except for when, 15 minutes into the show, his livestream abruptly cut off thanks to a technical glitch. </p> 
<p>“Rumble is under attack, this show is under attack, this is what these scumbags do,” he said. “Can’t have a voice like me speaking out.”</p> 
<p>“They just don’t want me to talk,” he repeated for the rest of the show.</p> 
<p>He also offered “behind the scenes” insights into his time at the FBI, defending himself against critics who misunderstood, he said, the decisions they made — including the agency’s handling of the Epstein files. </p> 
<p>“When you get selected for one of these principal or deputy positions, everything you do is a level 10 decision,” Bongino said. “Find out which one is the shittier decision and avoid it. That’s the best you can do.</p> 
<p>“Here’s the problem with the Epstein mess,” he continued. “The FBI doesn’t have the evidence many thought it did. … There were not tapes with powerful men raping kids. There was not a list. Epstein’s rolodex was already public. The files are largely unreleasable for many reasons.”</p> 
<p>The files didn’t contain the smoking gun people were expecting, Bongino said, but “this administration got you the information.”</p> 
<p>Near the end of the show, Trump — who hand-picked Bongino for his post last year — dialed in for a brief interview, where the two discussed the administration’s crime crackdown, Minnesota’s welfare fraud scandal and National Guard deployments.</p> 
<p>“I’ll tell you what, if I were a Democratic governor and I were in charge of Chicago, as an example, I would be begging Donald Trump to come,” Trump told Bongino.</p> 
<p>Trump took another chance to rail at the results of the 2020 election (“I won in a landslide,” he said), urging Republicans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/02/trump-nationalize-elections-2026-midterms-00760015" target="_blank">“nationalize the voting”&nbsp;and suggesting taking over voting “in&nbsp;at least 15&nbsp;places,”</a> which he didn’t name. And he patted himself on the back for his military actions in Iran and Venezuela, saying the U.S. is “respected again like never before.”</p> 
<p>“Listen, you did great in the FBI,” Trump told Bongino. “I’m very torn. I think, maybe, I’d rather have you where you are. “Very few people can do what you do, and your voice is a very important one.”</p> 
<p>Bongino, who has generally been a reliable supporter of Trump, intends to host his show every weekday. And for those expecting a Bongino chastened by his time in government — or those looking to take his space in the MAGA media sphere — he had a direct closing message.</p> 
<p>“All my bullshit detractors or whatever,” Bongino said at the end of the episode, “don’t know shit about anything. Throwing popcorn from the front row. We’re the number one livestream in the world. … I’m such a target that they came after the whole damn website. That’s how bad they want to keep me off the air.”</p> 
<p>“But I have my first — guys, you ready for this screenshot? — double barrel to those who tried to stop us,” he continued, silently flipping two middle fingers to the camera.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sen. Tina Smith is endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan as her successor over Rep. Angie Craig, taking sides in a hotly contested primary to fill Smith’s Senate seat that’s been roiled in recent weeks by the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.</p> 
<p>“Today, 3,000 federal agents are terrorizing our communities,” Smith said in a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/qYxv_Zhtqqs?feature=share" target="_blank"><u>video announcing her pick</u></a> that was shared first with POLITICO. “I know that right now there is no one that I trust more to stand with Minnesota than Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan.”</p> 
<p>Flanagan, in the video, called it an “honor” to have the retiring senator’s endorsement and pledged to “continue in her footsteps.”</p> 
<p>“We’re going to push back against the status quo and send a progressive fighter to continue representing us in Washington, D.C.,” Flanagan said.</p> 
<p>Smith’s endorsement comes a day before the state’s Democratic and Republican precinct caucuses, the first step in each party’s formal endorsement process.</p> 
<p>In selecting Flanagan, Smith is elevating a fellow lieutenant governor and progressive over Craig, a moderate, for the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/tina-smith-wont-seek-reelection-senate-2026-00204058" target="_blank"><u>seat she has held since 2018</u></a>. Smith is the eighth sitting senator to endorse Flanagan, who also has the backing of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other members of the so-called Fight Club of progressive senators of which they are all a part. Former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who held the seat before Smith, also endorsed Flanagan.</p> 
<p>Craig has some high-profile endorsements of her own, with five senators including Sens. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) in her corner, as well as former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p> 
<p>Smith's decision comes against the backdrop of deadly incidents involving federal agents enforcing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the state that have opened new fissures in the Senate primary. While both candidates have called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s impeachment, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/18/minnesota-ice-midterm-campaigns-00735146" target="_blank"><u>Flanagan has attacked Craig for taking “pro-Trump” immigration votes last year, while Craig has countered that her rival is being “disingenuous”</u></a> about the content and context of the measures.</p> 
<p>Antoine Givens, a spokesperson for Craig’s campaign, said in a statement that Craig “is the only candidate who has proven she can both win tough, competitive races against a Republican and go toe-to-toe with the Trump administration.”</p> 
<p>“From voting to impeach Donald Trump twice and now taking on Kristi Noem and ICE, to writing the law that capped the cost of insulin at $35 for seniors and banning members of Congress from trading stocks, Angie Craig has shown she’s the fighter Minnesotans need to hold the powerful accountable,” Givens said.</p> 
<p>Nonpartisan public polling in the race has been scant. Polling conducted in the past month for Flanagan’s team, as well as a separate survey commissioned by a pro-Flanagan group, shows the lieutenant governor with a <a href="https://x.com/lisakashinsky/status/2014350124999184445?s=20" target="_blank"><u>double-digit lead over Craig</u></a>. A poll commissioned by Craig’s campaign <a href="https://x.com/lisakashinsky/status/2016923932566196478?s=20" target="_blank"><u>showed the race </u></a>within the margin of error.</p> 
<p>Craig has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/senate-fundraising-campaign-finance-fec-00759078" target="_blank"><u>built a fundraising advantage in the race</u></a>, raising $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 and starting the election year with $3.7 million in cash on hand. Flanagan, meanwhile, raised roughly $1 million in that timeframe and ended the year with $810,646 in the bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump on Sunday endorsed former Sen. John E. Sununu in New Hampshire’s open Senate race, boosting a longtime critic over one of his former ambassadors, Scott Brown.</p> 
<p>Trump hailed Sununu, who Republicans see as their best chance to flip the blue Senate seat, as an “America First Patriot” in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115996882630849069" target="_blank">Truth Social post Sunday afternoon</a>. And Trump said Sununu will “work tirelessly to advance our America First Agenda.”</p> 
<p>“John E. Sununu has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN — ELECT JOHN E. SUNUNU,” he posted.</p> 
<p>Sununu, a moderate who has opposed Trump across his presidential runs, thanked him in a statement and quickly pivoted to talking about his priorities for New Hampshire.</p> 
<p>“I want to thank the President for his support and thank the thousands of Granite Staters who are supporting me,” Sununu said. “This campaign has and always will be about standing up for New Hampshire — every single day.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s endorsement further tips the scales in an already pitched GOP primary between Sununu and Brown, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate before moving to New Hampshire and running unsuccessfully for Senate there in 2014. He served as Trump’s ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa in his first term, and has been presenting himself as the more Trump-aligned candidate as he courts the MAGA base.</p> 
<p>Brown vowed to fight on. And he took a veiled shot at Sununu, accusing him of not being sufficiently dedicated to the MAGA movement.</p> 
<p>“I am running to ensure our America First agenda is led by someone who views this mission not as a career path, but as a continuation of a lifelong commitment to service,” Brown said in a <a href="https://x.com/SenScottBrown/status/2018064672117678232?s=20" target="_blank">post on X</a>. “Let’s keep working.”</p> 
<p>The two are competing to take on Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Pappas issued a simple response to Trump’s endorsement of Sununu: “I’m Chris Pappas, and I approve this message,” he <a href="https://x.com/ChrisPappasNH/status/2018056253658849537?s=20" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. His campaign manager, Rachel Petri, said in a statement that Trump’s endorsement “confirms” that Sununu “will sell out Granite Staters to advance his political career.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s support for Sununu once would have seemed unfathomable. The scion of a moderate New Hampshire Republican dynasty, Sununu served as a national co-chair of former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s 2016 presidential campaign and joined his family in backing former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley for president against Trump in the 2024 GOP primary.</p> 
<p>Ahead of New Hampshire’s 2024 presidential primary, Sununu penned an op-ed lambasting Trump as a “loser.” (Trump went on to win by 11 points). And he later derided Trump’s 2020 election conspiracies as “completely inappropriate.”</p> 
<p>Republicans initially were bullish about flipping an open seat in purple New Hampshire that’s already changed hands between parties twice this century — Sununu defeated Shaheen to win the seat in 2002, then lost it to her in 2008 — and coalesced quickly behind the moderate Republican as their best option against Pappas. Sununu received instant backing from the GOP’s Senate campaign arm <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/john-sununu-new-hampshire-senate-00618083" target="_blank">upon his launch last October</a> and has wracked up <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/11/17/trumps-message-to-maga-00654111?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=b3fddf54-40a1-41f4-a5a6-b76118141c45" target="_blank">endorsements from the majority of Republican senators</a>. He’s also won support from Republican leaders in New Hampshire — all of which Trump noted in his Truth Social post Sunday.</p> 
<p>Trump also <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5235266-chris-sununu-potential-senate-bid/" target="_blank">initially supported Sununu's younger brother</a>, former Gov. Chris Sununu, running for the Senate seat. Chris Sununu, also a vocal Trump critic, declined to launch a bid, prompting GOP interest in his brother.</p> 
<p>But some in Trump’s Granite State MAGA base quickly rejected his endorsement of Sununu, calling it a “slap in the face to grassroots supporters” long loyal to the president.</p> 
<p>“The Sununu family openly mocked, degraded, and worked against the America First movement, the President himself, and the policies that energized New Hampshire voters,” a group of MAGA activists <a href="https://x.com/Nh4Trump603/status/2018048300658614638?s=20" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “We will continue and intensify our campaign opposition to the Sununu operation.”</p> 
<p>Sununu holds a wide lead over Brown in polling of the GOP primary. The latest, a University of New Hampshire online <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/survey_center_polls/922/" target="_blank">survey of likely primary voters from mid-January</a>, showed Sununu up 48 percent to 25 percent with 26 percent of likely voters undecided. But Pappas is ahead of both Republicans in hypothetical general-election matchups, leading Sununu by 5 percentage points and Brown by 10 percentage points in the UNH poll. The survey of 967 likely GOP primary voters had a margin of error of +/-3.2 percent.</p> 
<p>Pappas also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/senate-fundraising-campaign-finance-fec-00759078" target="_blank">outraised both Republicans</a>, bringing in $2.3 million last quarter and amassing a $3.2 million war chest heading into the year. Sununu hauled in $1.3 million and had $1.1 million in cash on hand in his primary campaign account while Brown raised $347,000 through his main account and had $907,000 in the bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One bright spot for Democrats as they face a tough path to taking back the Senate this year: Their candidates are raising a lot of money.</p> 
<p>Democrats outraised their GOP counterparts across several of this year’s marquee Senate races heading into 2026, according to new filings submitted to the Federal Election Commission on Saturday.</p> 
<p>Sen. Jon Ossoff, the only Democrat running for reelection in a state Donald Trump won, enters the year with a massive fundraising advantage over any of his GOP rivals in battleground Georgia. Democrats in North Carolina and Ohio also started the year with a major financial edge over their GOP rivals.</p> 
<p>But heated Democratic primaries have helped Republicans maintain a cash advantage in a few key states, including Michigan, Maine and Iowa.</p> 
<p>Strong fundraising will be critical to Democrats’ efforts to hold all their seats — including several that are open following battleground senators’ retirements — while also flipping four Republican ones.</p> 
<p>In a handful of primaries, including the Democratic contests in Michigan and Texas and the Republican lineup in Georgia, fourth-quarter fundraising numbers largely did not show any one candidate majorly distinguishing themselves from the rest.</p> 
<p>Here’s a rundown of what the fundraising looked like in key Senate races.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Georgia</h4> 
<p>Ossoff holds a significant fundraising advantage over his Republican opponents duking it out in the primary. He raised $9.9 million in the final quarter of 2025 and ended the year with $25.5 million in his war chest — numbers that are substantially higher than all of his GOP rivals combined.</p> 
<p>Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter brought in the most in the GOP primary, raising $1.7 million and entering 2026 with $4.1 million cash on hand. Ex-football coach Derek Dooley reported raising $1.1 million, while Rep. Mike Collins raised just shy of $825,000. Dooley ended the quarter with $2.1 million left in the bank, while Collins reported having $2.3 million.</p> 
<p>While Ossoff holds a massive fundraising advantage, the gap is likely to shrink when the Republican nominee is selected in May and the party, including its donors, coalesces around one candidate.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">North Carolina</h4> 
<p>Democratic former governor Roy Cooper maintains a fundraising advantage in North Carolina over former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley.</p> 
<p>Cooper <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/29/roy-cooper-raises-3-4-million-in-first-24-hours-of-his-senate-candidacy-00481528" target="_blank">broke fundraising records</a> when he launched his campaign and has continued to bring in large sums, raising $7 million from October through December last year, according to his filings with the FEC — nearly double the $3.8 million Whatley raised during the same period. Cooper entered 2026 with $12.3 million in his campaign coffers, a sizable haul that will be necessary as he prepares for November.</p> 
<p>Whatley, who has been endorsed by Trump, ended the fourth quarter with $3.7 million in cash on hand. Both candidates — the likely nominees in the state’s Senate race — bring extensive donor networks from their prior roles, setting up North Carolina to be one of the most expensive contests this cycle.</p> 
<p>Operatives in both parties say spending could reach $650 million to $800 million. Democrats are eying the North Carolina seat, left open by the retirement of GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, as one of their best pick up opportunities in November.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Michigan</h4> 
<p>In Michigan, where Democrats are looking to hold retiring Sen. Gary Peters’ seat, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/michigan-senate-mcmorrow-stevens-el-sayed-00758408" target="_blank">three Democratic front-runners are locked in a tight race</a> — and their fundraising reflects it.</p> 
<p>Rep. Haley Stevens holds an early fundraising advantage, raising $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2025 and entered the year with roughly $3 million in the bank. Widely seen as the establishment candidate in the contentious primary, Stevens benefits from being able to tap into her existing donor networks, but her opponents are not far behind. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow and physician Abdul El-Sayed each raised roughly $1.7 million and ended the year with around $1.9 million in the bank.</p> 
<p>With Michigan’s Aug. 4 primary — later than most states — the Democratic candidates will need to sustain strong fundraising numbers through what is shaping up to be a long and expensive intraparty fight.</p> 
<p>Former Rep. Mike Rogers, the frontrunner on the GOP side, raised $1.9 million and ended the fourth quarter with $3.5 million in cash on hand.</p> 
<p>Rogers — the candidate most national Republicans have coalesced around — will benefit from being the main GOP candidate while Democrats get through <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/michigan-senate-mcmorrow-stevens-el-sayed-00758408" target="_blank">their bruising primary</a>. He also ran for the Senate in 2024, giving him a network of donors to tap into. The GOP is eying Michigan — where <a href="https://www.politico.com/2024-election/results/michigan/" target="_blank">Trump won by just</a> over a point in 2024 — as a top pickup opportunity in November.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Maine</h4> 
<p>Political newcomer and oysterman Graham Platner outraised both Gov. Janet Mills, his main Democratic rival, and incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, who is one of the party’s top targets as the only GOP senator representing a state won by Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.</p> 
<p>Platner raised $4.6 million in the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 million for Collins and $2.7 million for Mills, who launched her campaign in mid-October.</p> 
<p>But Collins, who has not formally launched her campaign yet, sits on far more cash than both her Democratic rivals, with a little over $8 million in the bank compared to $3.7 million for Platner and $1.3 million for Mills.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Ohio</h4> 
<p>Former Sen. Sherrod Brown significantly outraised Sen. Jon Husted (R-Ohio) in the fourth quarter, giving Democrats a boost in their longshot bid to flip the Senate seat in the state that has turned increasingly red. Brown raised $7.3 million, while Husted — appointed last year to fill the seat vacated by JD Vance becoming vice president — raised $1.5 million.</p> 
<p>Brown, a prolific fundraiser, began 2026 with $9.9 million in his war chest. He is expected to need deep reserves again, after cryptocurrency-linked groups spent heavily against him during his unsuccessful 2024 reelection bid. Husted started the year with just under $6 million.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">New Hampshire</h4> 
<p>In New Hampshire, Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas continued to comfortably outraise his Republican competition in the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Pappas brought in $2.3 million in the fourth quarter and ended 2025 with $3.2 million cash on hand.</p> 
<p>Former Sen. John Sununu, who was defeated by Shaheen in 2008 and is running with the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, raised $1.3 million and had $1.1 million cash on hand. His Republican primary rival Scott Brown, who briefly represented neighboring Massachusetts in the Senate, raised just $374,000 and had $907,000 in the bank.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Texas</h4> 
<p>Money is flowing into the Democratic primary in Texas, where Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico both raised over $6 million during the fourth quarter.</p> 
<p>Crockett, who launched her Senate campaign in early December, raised $2 million from donors through the end of the month and transferred another $4.5 million from her previous House campaign account. But Talarico, a state representative from Austin, outraised Crockett with a $6.9 million quarter and ended the year with more money in the bank. He started 2026 with $7.1 million in his war chest, compared to $5.6 million for the Dallas-area representative.</p> 
<p>Both candidates outraised the Republican field by a wide margin. On the GOP side, state Attorney General Ken Paxton raked in $1.1 million, while incumbent Sen. John Cornyn raised $1 million for his campaign and another $6 million through two joint fundraising committees, which he has used to run TV ads on his behalf. Rep. Wesley Hunt, polling in third in the GOP primary, raised just over $429,000.</p> 
<p>Cornyn — whose reelection bid has been <a href="https://www.nrsc.org/press-releases/nrsc-chairman-tim-scotts-statement-on-texas-senate-race-2025-04-09/" target="_blank">endorsed by the NRSC</a> — still maintains a huge cash-on-hand advantage for the primary. He has more than $15 million in the bank between his campaign account and two joint fundraising committees, a war chest that could prove pivotal in the final stretch of the March 3 primary — or an extended runoff. He is locked in a neck-and-neck race with Paxton, according to public polls.</p> 
<p>Paxton entered 2026 with $3.7 million in the bank. Hunt had $778,660.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Iowa</h4> 
<p>Democrats duking it out in Iowa’s Senate primary posted modest fundraising hauls in the fourth quarter. State Rep. Josh Turek raised $677,000, while state Sen. Zach Wahls brought in $741,000. Nathan Sage, the third Democrat viewed as competitive for the nomination, brought in $229,000.</p> 
<p>Wahls entered 2026 with the cash-on-hand advantage. He had $733,000 left in his war chest, while Turek had just shy of $400,000. Sage had $86,000 in the bank at the start of the year.</p> 
<p>Whichever Democrats wins will need serious money to try flipping the seat left open by retiring Sen. Joni Ernst.</p> 
<p>Rep. Ashley Hinson brought in $1.6 million and had nearly $5.2 million in the bank at the end of 2025, a substantial fundraising advantage over all of her potential Democratic opponents.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Minnesota</h4> 
<p>In Minnesota, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are front-runners on the Democratic side vying for the open Senate seat. Craig has built a fundraising advantage, raising $2 million in the fourth quarter and ending it with $3.7 million left in the bank, while Flanagan raised roughly $1 million and ended the year with $810,646 in the bank.</p> 
<p>On the Republican side, Michele Tafoya, a former sideline reporter for “Sunday Night Football” and conservative commentator, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/michele-tafoya-minnesota-senate-00738041" target="_blank"><u>launched her bid in late January</u></a>, so her campaign launch fundraising isn’t yet public.Tafoya quickly received the backing of the Republicans' Senate campaign arm after launching her bid, so she is expected to have strong fundraising support to carry her through the August primary and into the general.</p> 
<p>The GOP contest has a handful of other primary contenders, including former Minnesota Republican Party Chair David Hann.</p> 
<h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Alaska</h4> 
<p>Former Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola launched her Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/peltola-alaska-senate-2026-midterms-00721596" target="_blank"><u>bid in mid-January</u></a>, so her fourth quarter FEC report did not capture her Senate fundraising. But she raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her bid to unseat Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/14/mary-peltola-alaska-fundraising-00726856" target="_blank"><u>POLITICO previously reported</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Sullivan raised $1.4 million during the fourth quarter, according to his FEC report, and entered 2026 with $5.8 million in his war chest.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DETROIT — As a professional driver navigated a gleaming new Ford Bronco Sport up a steep ridge, Mallory McMorrow found herself pinned in the back seat clinging to the overhead roll bar.</p> 
<p>The Detroit Auto Show course is designed to show off the Bronco’s capabilities — while putting an escapist scare into its thrill-seeking passengers. But it just reminded McMorrow of her day-to-day reality running for Michigan’s open Senate seat.</p> 
<p>“It’s a teeter-totter, man,” McMorrow told POLITICO about her race, after having navigated a very literal giant teeter-totter in the Bronco. “It could go any direction.”</p> 
<p>McMorrow is locked in a tight three-way primary with Rep. Haley Stevens and physician Abdul El-Sayed that has emerged as a test for what the next generation of Democrats will look like — and whether they can win a key swing-state election that will help determine Senate control.</p> 
<p>In recent days, the trio of candidates’ squabbles careened hour to hour from whether they should embrace Medicare for All, to how far Democrats should go in fighting ICE. In fact, the contest has emerged as a catch-all for every question and problem plaguing Democrats politically and tactically: Where should they stand on Israel and Gaza? Should they send their aging congressional leaders packing? What does electability look like in this political environment? Should Democrats tap into the attention economy or focus on traditional campaigning?</p> 
<p>El-Sayed, on the left, has taken consistently maximalist positions fitting for a man who wrote a book titled “Medicare For All: A Citizen’s Guide” and has vocal support from Sen. Bernie Sanders. Stevens, a classic swing-state centrist favored by many establishment Democrats, has taken smaller-bore stances. Between them sits McMorrow, who’s aiming to appeal to voters in both of their lanes.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/5d/32/3fbb1ef0403f9dd7966afb101a27/detroit-auto-show-49568.jpg" alt="Mallory McMorrow listens to a speaker talk about Toyota vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 14." data-portal-copyright="AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="26014822249568" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Mallory McMorrow listens to a speaker talk about Toyota vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 14."/><p>But this three-way battle to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) isn’t just about what direction the Democratic Party takes in Washington — it’s whether they can get there in the first place.</p> 
<p>Democrats think they see a route back to the Senate majority. But if they don’t hold on to their seat in Michigan, that faint path won’t materialize.</p> 
<p>“It's already a long shot, but it's a doable thing — but not without Michigan,” said David Axelrod, the longtime senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.</p> 
<p>Axelrod called it the “most fascinating and consequential primary” in the country.</p> 
<p>Democratic leaders both in Michigan and D.C. are growing more worried by the day that the hard-fought contest, which won’t be decided until the August primary, will exacerbate ideological tensions and leave the nominee in a weakened position heading into a contest against former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.).</p> 
<p>“We're used to having long primaries,” Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) told POLITICO. “No one loves them, but we're used to having them. And I don't think it's insurmountable.”</p> 
<p>For now, the race is wide open.</p> 
<p>Most <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5709140-democratic-senate-race-michigan/" target="_blank">public polls have found</a> a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/14/michigan-senate-race-poll-mike-rogers-haley-stevens-mallory-mcmorrow-abdul-el-sayed/88148893007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z11xx50p119950c119950d00----v11xx50d--65--&amp;gca-ft=169&amp;gca-ds=sophi" target="_blank">tight three-way race</a> in the primary, with Stevens or McMorrow holding a slight lead depending on the survey; in those same polls, Stevens runs slightly ahead of Rogers in the general election, with McMorrow just a bit behind her and El-Sayed a bit further back.</p> 
<p>Stevens has a fundraising edge. According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports, which posted on Saturday, she brought in $2.1 million in the past quarter and has $3 million cash on hand; McMorrow and El-Sayed both raised around $1.75 million and each has just under $2 million in the bank. Rogers raised just under $2 million and has just under $3.5 million cash on hand.<br></p><p>Part of the lack of separation in the polls is that voters haven’t engaged yet. The campaigns don’t expect cleavage until paid media starts happening in full (El-Sayed is the only candidate so far to roll out a statewide ad.)</p> 
<p>“Only the most political have started to click in,” Slotkin said.</p> 
<p>Michigan Democrats also worried about the impact the primary could have on the rest of the party as they fight to hold on to term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office and win back control of the Legislature.</p> 
<p>Whitmer, with her 60 percent approval rating, is facing a pressure campaign from some in the party to endorse either Stevens or McMorrow early in the race to narrow the field, according to two senior Michigan Democratic officials granted anonymity to speak about private discussions. Otherwise, one of them worried, “we could see real losses.”</p> 
<p>Whitmer and El-Sayed duked it out in a 2018 gubernatorial primary, and the officials say bad blood remains between them.</p> 
<p>A Whitmer spokesperson declined to comment.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/2a/84/60dcb5b2431cb454798f01730d41/democratic-national-convention-58746.jpg" alt="Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer is facing a pressure campaign from some in the party to endorse either Haley Stevens or Mallory McMorrow early in the race to narrow the field."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large">A clash of ideologies</h4> 
<p>The candidates have sharp ideological divides on major issues including health care, Israel and Gaza and accepting corporate PAC money.</p> 
<p>After a second person was killed by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, the three candidates' diverging approach to ICE and its funding supercharged the primary.</p> 
<p>While McMorrow and Stevens glad-handed at the Detroit Auto Show and union halls around the MLK holiday, after immigration agents killed Renee Good and before they killed Alex Pretti, El-Sayed, who has championed the Abolish ICE movement since 2018, went to Minneapolis and filmed <a href="https://x.com/AbdulElSayed/status/2013413511624315184?s=20" target="_blank">man-on-the-street</a> interviews for social media that were reminiscent of New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s successful viral campaign videos.</p> 
<p>He told POLITICO he was there to “understand what it looks like when an arm of the government lays siege to a city in America.” (El-Sayed also jetted to California for a fundraiser earlier that week).</p> 
<p>McMorrow has <a href="https://x.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/2015856774931169545?s=20" target="_blank">expressed support</a>for reforms to ICE, such as requiring agents to be unmasked, and argues Republicans and Democrats should “deny DHS one penny more until complete overhaul and accountability of this agency” happens.</p> 
<p>Stevens, meanwhile, is co-sponsoring a bill that would divert what she called ICE’s $75 billion "slush fund" to state and local law enforcement agencies; she has also called for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s impeachment.</p> 
<p>The candidates are also at odds over health care, an issue over which they’ve sparred in recent days.</p> 
<p>In an interview with Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen last week, El-Sayed reignited the health care debate. He said, “if you like your insurance from your employer or from your union, that can still be there for you,” apparently flipping on his stance on Medicare for All. McMorrow and her allies seized on his remarks as El-Sayed seemingly embracing a position he had repeatedly attacked her on. El-Sayed hosted a December <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE43EDDNHw0" target="_blank">health care town hall with Sanders</a> where he contrasted his Medicare for All support with McMorrow’s and Steven’s backing of a public option.</p> 
<p>“It’s wild to call yourself the ‘next generation’ of Democratic leadership and be running AGAINST Medicare for All in 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/AbdulElSayed/status/2005687425260302589?s=20" target="_blank">he posted on X</a> a month ago, quote-tweeting McMorrow.<br></p><p>In an interview with POLITICO after the dustup, El-Sayed declined to discuss specifics of his position on the record. In a statement, a spokesperson said that he supports Medicare for All as a baseline option for everyone, "and if folks want additional private coverage through a union or an employer then that can be there for them too."</p> 
<p>The conflict in Gaza has also led to sharp divisions in the race.</p> 
<p>El-Sayed, who is the son of Egyptian immigrants, has been an outspoken critic of Israel, which he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan-democratic-primary-gaza-genocide-00594679" target="_blank">has long said</a> was committing genocide in Gaza. That’s a major issue in a state with the highest percent of Arab-Americans in the country; more than 100,000 people voted “uncommitted” instead of backing then-President Joe Biden in the 2024 primary over his administration’s support of Israel — an effort El-Sayed helped lead.</p> 
<p>He told POLITICO that when he talks about U.S. tax dollars “being misappropriated to weaponize food against children and to subsidize a genocide, rather than to invest in real people in their communities and their kids and their schools and their health care, it is the single biggest applause line in every speech.”</p> 
<p>McMorrow took a bit more time to come to that view. In October, when asked whether she thought the conflict was a genocide, she paused for several seconds, exhaled, and responded, “Based on the definition, yes.” Her campaign said her view was informed by a September <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds" target="_blank">United Nations Commission of Inquiry report</a>.</p> 
<p>Stevens has been more supportive of Israel, and has the support of AIPAC, the politically influential pro-Israel lobby. Some senior Michigan Democrats have expressed concern that an AIPAC independent expenditure campaign backing Haley could make the primary even more toxic ahead of the general election. Asked about their plans, an AIPAC spokesperson told POLITICO they had no updates.</p> 
<p>Asked by POLITICO in November whether she was comfortable with AIPAC support, Stevens dodged, saying she’s delighted to “see the hostages get home,” and added she “wanted to see an enduring ceasefire where Hamas surrenders and so that we can get the people of Palestine and Israel in long standing peace, living peacefully, side by side with one another.”</p> 
<p>Stevens' campaign also attacked both El-Sayed and McMorrow's record on manufacturing, a sector that employs some 600,000 in Michigan. She told POLITICO that McMorrow "has a history of criticizing Michigan's key industries" and that El-Sayed "supports policies that would decimate Michigan's manufacturing economy," citing his support for the Green New Deal.</p> 
<p>“I’m going to call out what isn’t working for Michigan’s manufacturing economy, whether it is Mike Rogers or members of my own party,” Stevens said in an interview in the conference room of the Teamsters Local 234 union hall in Plymouth.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/3b/e9/f1daf64949928b1776673a1caba2/u-s-congress-37720.jpg" alt=" Some senior Michigan Democrats have expressed concern that an AIPAC independent expenditure campaign backing Rep. Haley Haley could make the senatorial primary even more toxic ahead of the general election." data-portal-copyright="Francis Chung/POLITICO" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title=" Some senior Michigan Democrats have expressed concern that an AIPAC independent expenditure campaign backing Rep. Haley Haley could make the senatorial primary even more toxic ahead of the general election."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Old school vs. new school</h4> 
<p>The race is also shaping up as a test of offline coalitional politics at a moment increasingly defined more by viral videos than baby-kissing and union hall campaign stops.</p> 
<p>Stevens has leaned hardest into traditional brick-and-mortar campaigning, while El-Sayed has been much more focused online, with McMorrow’s approach once again falling between them.</p> 
<p>McMorrow’s biggest splash of the campaign so far came with a <a href="https://x.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/1964673063175307685?s=20" target="_blank">viral video</a> that attacked NFL RedZone for adding ads as “the latest example of corporate greed,” and tied it to spiking grocery costs. It earned nearly 2 million views.</p> 
<p>El-Sayed has built a national profile and fundraising network in part with a health care-focused podcast on Crooked Media, the network run by the Pod Save America team made up largely of former Obama senior advisers. At least three members, Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Ben Rhodes, appeared as hosts on an invite to El-Sayed’s fundraiser earlier this month in California.<br></p><p>Stevens has taken a different tack, putting more focus on campaign stops and meat-and-potatoes fights for local industry, especially auto and other factory jobs.</p> 
<p>In a year-out-from-election day memo, Stevens’ campaign argued that her “strength with Black Michiganders and union workers, her relentless focus on lowering costs and protecting Michigan manufacturing, and her record fighting for Michiganders — which has led to her winning tough primaries and general elections — will propel her to victory.”</p> 
<p>Campaigning at a Teamsters Local 234 union hall in Plymouth, she spent a lot more time talking about a local labor contract dispute than national concerns.</p> 
<p>“Look, manufacturing might not light up the internet, but it fuels a lot of jobs here,” she told POLITICO afterward.</p> 
<p>That dogged approach helped her flip and <a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2020-11-05/stevens-wins-second-term-in-us-house-11th-district" target="_blank">hold a swing seat</a>, then <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/rep-haley-stevens-beats-levin-in-battle-of-democratic-incumbents-00049449" target="_blank">win a tough incumbent-on-incumbent primary</a> in 2022, and is one she thinks will pay dividends now.</p> 
<p>“I’ve had a couple of tough primaries before, and I’m just out here trying to win it for Michiganders,” she said.</p> 
<p>But it remains unclear how well it will translate in a statewide campaign.</p> 
<p>“Haley seems to have more institutional support — whether or not it’s admitted as such — and that is a strength, but it also could be a weakness,” said a longtime Michigan Democratic operative who remains neutral in the race and was granted anonymity to assess the primary. “Her presence on the campaign trail I’m not sure is one that’s really like, <i>Man, I got to be with her.”</i></p> 
<p>Stevens has earned criticism over whether she can galvanize the online, grassroots activists, or electrify crowds on the trail. “She's [an] uneven campaigner when it comes to the retail stuff,” said Adam Jentleson, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist who<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/us/politics/democrats-liberals-jentleson-searchlight.html" target="_blank">is pushing for the party to break more with left-wing interest groups</a> and focus more on expanding the party’s coalition to win (he also voiced concern about El-Sayed as a general-election candidate).</p> 
<p>Right now, both El-Sayed and Stevens have been training most of their fire on McMorrow rather than each other, seeing her as the bigger threat to their potential voting coalitions.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/c5/8a/6b1ce2b846acbe373c2d5ba562ff/michigan-governor-2018-30366.jpg" alt="Abdul El-Sayed, left, is running with the support of progressives such as Sen.

Bernie Sanders, who also supported him in his 2018 run for governor."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large">Insiders and outsiders</h4> 
<p>Stevens’ electoral track record is part of why many establishment-leaning Democrats in D.C. prefer her in the race.</p> 
<p>Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) invited her to attend a fundraising retreat in Napa Valley that featured a crypto roundtable, but Stevens told POLITICO she did not attend due to the government shutdown.</p> 
<p>In an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/14/schumer-thinks-these-four-states-will-deliver-for-dems-in-november-00727181" target="_blank">interview with POLITICO</a>, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was bullish on defending Michigan but declined to appraise any individual candidacies; a DSCC spokesperson declined to comment on whether the committee would officially endorse in the race.<br></p><p>McMorrow has taken a very different approach to D.C.’s Democratic leadership.</p> 
<p>She<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/25/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan-senate-chuck-schumer-00246369?utm_campaign=5/16/25++AM:&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=Punchbowl+AM+and+Active+Subscribers+from+Memberful+Combined" target="_blank">told POLITICO last March</a>, before she was even officially a candidate, that she wouldn’t vote for Schumer as party leader should she win her Senate seat. She also previously penned a scathing letter to Biden following his disastrous debate with Donald Trump, urging him to drop out.</p> 
<p>“We’re drawing a contrast that is really about defining my lane,” McMorrow said in an interview at a campaign stop at a park in Grand Rapids late last year, suggesting Stevens, without naming her, was running “an uninspiring campaign that’s right out of the D.C. playbook” and that El-Sayed, also without naming him, was campaigning on the idea “that there’s just one weird trick to fix democracy.”</p> 
<p>Stevens has said it’s too early to determine whether to would back Schumer; she has called him “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/video/sotu-panel-breaks-down-democrat-infighting-after-shutdown-battle" target="_blank">a great leader.”</a></p> 
<p>El-Sayed also hasn’t said whether he’d back Schumer for leader. But he’s made it clear he is running headlong against the Democratic establishment.</p> 
<p>“The movement we’re building is about taking a bet on the divide in our politics not really being about left versus right, but being about the folks who are locked out and the folks who are locking them out,” El-Sayed told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>About the only thing the candidates can all agree on is the stakes of the contest.</p> 
<p>“The future of this party is going to be based on what happens in this race,” McMorrow said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump’s political war chest grew dramatically in the second half of 2025, according to new campaign finance disclosures submitted late Saturday, giving him an unprecedented amount of money for a term-limited president to influence the midterms and beyond.</p> 
<p>Trump raised $26 million through his joint fundraising committee in the back half of last year, and another $8 million directly into his leadership PAC. And a super PAC linked to him has more than $300 million in the bank.</p> 
<p>All together, a web of campaign accounts, some of which he controls directly and others under the care of close allies, within the president’s orbit have $375 million in their coffers.</p> 
<p>The funds far outstrip those of any other political figure — Republican or Democrat — entering 2026, and have no real historical precedent. And Trump could put them to use this year for the midterms, or to shape future elections, even as he cannot run for president again.</p> 
<p>Trump continues to outpace any other Republican in raising money, both from large and small-dollar donors. His joint fundraising committee — Trump National Committee, which pools fundraising for a variety of Trump-aligned groups — accounted for 1 in 8 dollars raised on WinRed, the primary Republican online fundraising platform, during the second half of 2025, according to a POLITICO analysis.</p> 
<p>And no super PAC raised even half as much in 2025 as the $289 million from MAGA Inc., the Trump-aligned super PAC that both the president and Vice President J.D. Vance appeared at fundraisers for last year.</p> 
<p>Trump has given few clues as to how he might put the funds to use. Trump National Committee primarily sends funds to the president’s leadership PAC, Never Surrender, with a bit of money also going to the Republican National Committee and Vance’s leadership PAC, Working For Ohio.</p> 
<p>Candidates cannot use leadership PAC money for their own election efforts. But the accounts — which are common across Washington and have long been derided by anti-money in politics groups as “slush funds” — allow politicians to dole out money to allies or fund political travel.</p> 
<p>Never Surrender spent $6.7 million from July through December, with more than half of that total going toward advertising, digital consulting and direct mail — expenses typically linked to fundraising.</p> 
<p>So far, Trump’s groups have held their powder in Republican primaries. While Trump has endorsed against a handful of Republican incumbents now locked in competitive primaries — including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — and threatened others, he hasn’t used money. A super PAC targeting Massie, MAGA KY, is run by Trump allies but has largely been funded by GOP megadonor Paul Singer.</p> 
<p>MAGA Inc.’s only election-related spending last year was to boost now-Rep. Matt Van Epps in the special election in Tennessee’s 7th District.</p> 
<p>Trump’s massive war chest makes him a political force, independent of the traditional party infrastructure. The RNC — which derives a significant portion of its fundraising from Trump — had $95 million in the bank at the end of the year, roughly a quarter of what the Trump-linked groups have.</p> 
<p>And their rivals at the Democratic National Committee are far worse off — at just over $14 million, while owing more than $17 million in debt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, a Democrat, won a special runoff election on Saturday to serve the remainder of former Texas Rep. Sylvester’s term, who died last year.</p> 
<p>The Associated Press projected that Menefee beat Amanda Edwards, an attorney and former member of the Houston City council, after a protracted process to fill the central Houston seat after Turner's death in March 2025. The process was drawn out by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott’s refusal to quickly schedule a special election following Turner’s death and a crowded field that triggered a runoff following the first round of voting in November.</p> 
<p>But the contest between the pair will continue: Both Menefee, 37, and Edwards, 44, are participating in the March primary for a newly refashioned 18th Congressional District, going up against Rep. Al Green, 78. That winner will be heavily favored to win a full two-year term in November.</p> 
<p>The March primary is the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/31/texas-18-runoff-dems-00758614" target="_blank"><u>latest example</u></a> of the generational change debate animating the Democratic Party, as the two young Democrats take on progressive icon Green, who has been in Congress for more than two decades. It's a fight that’s taking place nationwide, pitting young and old factions of the party against each other as they both argue they’re better fighters against Republicans.</p> 
<p>Residents in this district have been without consistent representation since former Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee died in 2024. Lee held the seat for three decades.</p> 
<p>Green’s current district was scrambled by the Texas GOP’s redistricting, prompting him to jump into the race to represent a new district that contains many of his constituents.</p> 
<p>Menefee’s victory is a huge boost to his public profile ahead of the primary. Early voting begins in two weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>
