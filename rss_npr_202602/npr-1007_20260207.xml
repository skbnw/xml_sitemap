      <title>Searching for dinosaur secrets in crocodile bones</title>
      <description>Until now, estimating how old a dinosaur was when it died has been a fairly simple process: Count up the growth rings in the fossilized bones. But new research into some of dinosaurs&apos; living relatives, like crocodiles, suggests that this method may not always work.</description>
