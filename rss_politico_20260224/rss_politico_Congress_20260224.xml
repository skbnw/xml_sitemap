      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Neal Dunn plans to serve out the rest of his term, a spokesperson said Monday, addressing rumors that the Florida Republican would resign early and potentially put the GOP House majority at risk.</p> 
<p>The announcement comes after Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this month <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/neal-dunn-resignation-johnson-00776216" target="_blank">he'd urged Dunn to stay in Congress</a>. Senior House Republicans believed at the time that Dunn, who is facing health issues and announced his retirement in January, could step down in the coming months and further narrow the GOP's majority.</p> 
<p>"As a dedicated public servant, he will remain in Congress to represent his constituents through the end of this term," spokesperson Eleanor Allison said in response to inquiries first made on Feb. 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three prominent House Republican women called on GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales to step down Monday, applying major new pressure on the Texas lawmaker to address accusations that he had an affair with his staffer who later died by suicide.</p> 
<p>Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado became the first Republican lawmaker to call for Gonzales' resignation, followed by Reps. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who were both prompted to speak out by the release of new alleged text messages between the lawmaker and his subordinate.</p> 
<p>Separately Monday, in his first comments on the matter, Speaker Mike Johnson called the allegations “very serious” but declined to call for further action as investigations into Gonzales play out. Rep. Brandon Gill, a fellow Texas Republican, also called for Gonzales to end his reelection bid.</p> 
<p>Gonzales, who is in his third term representing a potentially competitive south Texas district, has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/20/politics/tony-gonzales-denies-affair-allegations" target="_blank">previously denied</a> having an improper relationship with the staffer, Regina Santos-Aviles, who <a href="https://people.com/regina-santos-aviles-cause-of-death-determined-after-catching-fire-alone-in-her-backyard-11816190" target="_blank">died after lighting herself on fire</a> in September.</p> 
<p>The sordid allegations have come under intense public scrutiny in recent weeks as Gonzales faces a heated primary election, fueling widespread speculation about his future in politics as he faces a potential ethics investigation.</p> 
<p>Gonzales’ office did not respond to messages seeking comment Monday on the recent comments from his colleagues.</p> 
<p>Boebert told POLITICO that <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/article/tony-gonzales-texts-regina-santos-aviles-pictures-21362068.php" target="_blank">newly released text messages</a> published in media outlets underscore the need for Gonzales to resign, saying they “seemingly show a perverted boss drunkenly coercing a vulnerable staffer into explicit conversations, pressing her for ‘sexy pics,’ asking about her favorite sexual positions.”</p> 
<p>POLITICO has not independently reviewed the messages.</p> 
<p>“This kind of abuse of power has no place anywhere, let alone in Congress, and Tony Gonzales should be ashamed and RESIGN IMMEDIATELY!” Boebert said.</p> 
<p>Luna <a href="https://x.com/RepLuna/status/2026010250382610570" target="_blank">said on X</a> that “every single other Member of Congress … should be condemning a sitting Member of Congress asking for explicit photos of their staff.”</p> 
<p>“As a woman, this is really disgusting to see. Not to mention, it brings dishonor on the House of Representatives. I am so sick of people not calling this crap out,” Luna added.</p> 
<p>Mace called the texts "disgusting and inexcusable" and said Congress should "have ZERO tolerance for those who abuse their power over others."</p> 
<p>In comments to reporters Monday, Johnson said Gonzales must “address” the allegations with his constituents. But the speaker, who is struggling to maintain a razor-thin GOP majority, did not pull his endorsement of the Texas Republican with the primary just eight days away — in keeping with handling of other personal controversies faced by his members.</p> 
<p>“I endorsed Tony before all these allegations came out — they're obviously very serious,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol. “And I've spoken with him and told him he's got to address that in the appropriate way with his constituents, and all of that.”</p> 
<p>Luna and Boebert were among a group of House Republican women who have criticized how top House GOP leaders, mostly men, have approached allegations of sexual misconduct — including, for Boebert and Mace, the effort to keep the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein files under wraps.</p> 
<p>Both were outraged at how Johnson and other GOP leaders handled an unsuccessful Democratic effort recently to censure Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) over <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/cory-millis-threats-allegations-gop-00496518" target="_blank">now-retracted allegations of domestic assault</a> and improper dealings with his arms company. Mills has denied the allegations, which remain <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/ethics-investigates-mills-00660582" target="_blank">under Ethics Committee review</a>.</p> 
<p>Johnson told reporters Monday he is handling the Gonzales matter in line with other allegations of misconduct, including those surrounding then Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was expelled from the House over Johnson’s objections in 2023 ahead of a formal ethics trial.</p> 
<p>“You have to let the system play out,” he said. “If the accusation of something is going to be the litmus test for someone being able to continue to serve in the House, we'll have a lot of people who would have to resign or be removed or expelled from Congress.”</p> 
<p>More House Republican women are reading the purported text messages between Gonzales and Santos-Aviles, and two women lawmakers granted anonymity to comment on the sensitive situation said it’s likely Johnson will come under more internal pressure to take action against Gonzales.</p> 
<p>Johnson said he understood that the Office of Congressional Conduct is investigating Gonzales as well as Texas state authorities. Mills also remains <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/ethics-investigates-mills-00660582" target="_blank">subject to a House ethics investigation</a>.</p> 
<p>More recently, he has accused Santos-Aviles’ widower, Adrian Aviles, of engaging in a blackmail effort as he has given interviews criticizing Gonzales and released text messages between the lawmaker, who is a 45-year-old married father of six, and Santos-Aviles, who was 35.</p> 
<p>An attorney for Aviles, Bobby Barrera, did not immediately return a call for comment. Barrera has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tony-gonzales-blackmail-allegation-ce31ebb350599731f2e833db1e9bf0d3" target="_blank">publicly denied</a> the blackmail accusation, explaining that he was attempting to recover damages through a potential lawsuit on behalf of Aviles.</p> 
<p>One key player who has not weighed in on Gonzales is President Donald Trump, who endorsed him in December as Republicans face pressure to hold on to his must-win seat. Trump this weekend withdrew his endorsement for one House Republican — Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, who voted down Trump’s Canada tariffs last week — but has stayed silent as the Gonzales scandal swirls.</p> 
<p>Another issue facing Gonzales: GOP hardliners in Congress have been trying to replace him with a more hard-right Republican on immigration for years now. And Monday, the Freedom Caucus’ campaign arm officially endorsed his GOP primary challenger, Brandon Herrera, for a second time.</p> 
<p>Herrera only lost to Gonzales by several hundred votes in 2022. He is now calling on Gonzales to step down and for congressional Republicans to rescind their support for the incumbent. Gonzales has countered that his opponent is fueling what he says are false allegations.</p> 
<p>Trump, meanwhile, is facing intraparty pressure to distance himself from Gonzales, with far-right influencer Laura Loomer recently <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/2024299165518369252" target="_blank">calling on social media</a> for Trump to rescind his endorsement of Gonzales.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday House officials are scrambling to find a way to accommodate the gold-medal-winning U.S. men and women's hockey teams at Tuesday's State of the Union address.</p> 
<p>Johnson told reporters Monday he's working to "figure out logistics" now for a potential visit from the teams, which were each invited by the White House and have dozens of players and coaches on their rosters.</p> 
<p>"There's no way to have special guests on the floor because it's a literal session of Congress," he said. "But we're going to work and do what we can to accommodate." </p> 
<p>The speaker added that House officials are "trying to work out logistics to see if there's some way to perhaps get them into the gallery and the doors, wave and receive the applause that they're due."</p> 
<p>Neither team has announced plans to attend the speech, though Trump <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-invites-us-mens-hockey-team-state-union-speech-after-olympic-triumph" target="_blank">personally invited the men's team</a> in the immediate aftermath of their overtime win Sunday, offering to send a military jet to bring them to Washington.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for the women's team <a href="https://x.com/albamonica/status/2025989449197158504?s=46&amp;t=ncdqfRV74gcQrRg3XkYQbA" target="_blank">told NBC News</a> that while its members are "sincerely grateful" for the invitation, they cannot attend the speech "due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is heading into Tuesday’s State of the Union facing a messy Capitol Hill backdrop: a Supreme Court smackdown of his global tariffs, fresh GOP anxiety over the political fallout and a DHS funding standoff that’s revealing chaos within his own administration.</p> 
<p>Add in a snowstorm scrambling the House and Senate schedule — postponing House votes on aviation safety legislation and delaying a key farm bill markup — and lawmakers are facing a compressed, high-stakes week.</p> 
<p>Here’s what we’re watching:</p> 
<p><b>— Trump's address:&nbsp;</b>Attendance could be thin as lawmakers try to get back to Washington after a major snow storm on the East Coast. Many Democrats had already planned to boycott.</p> 
<p>Several Republicans told POLITICO they hope Trump will focus on affordability and economic issues and highlight the megabill tax cuts.</p> 
<p>Trump critics on both sides of the aisle plan to make statements with their SOTU guests. Several Democrats are bringing individuals impacted by rising health care costs and the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) is bringing his wife, Carolyn Moffa, who has been a target of attacks from Trump.</p> 
<p>“Trump thought it was appropriate to include her in two of his broadsides,” Massie said. “So I thought it would be appropriate to invite her to his speech.”</p> 
<p><b>— Tariff fallout:&nbsp;</b>After the Supreme Court struck down Trump’s sweeping global tariffs Friday — a move <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/anti-tariff-republicans-cheer-supreme-court-decision-checking-trump-00790772" target="_blank">cheered by a number of GOP lawmakers</a> — Hill Republicans are now in a tough position as Democrats hope to put them on the record voting for or against the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/21/trump-tariff-supreme-court-00792288" target="_blank">new 15 percent global tariffs</a> the president announced in response.</p> 
<p>The new tariffs expire after 150 days and Congress will have to vote to extend them — something Republicans privately say they won’t have the support to do.</p> 
<p>Among the Republicans who have tough decisions to make are farm state lawmakers who had been pressing the administration for carveouts in Trump’s tariffs but voted in support of his Canada tariffs. They got a taste of what could happen if they cross Trump, who over the weekend rescinded his endorsement of Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) and endorsed his GOP challenger.</p> 
<p>Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), one of the six Republicans who voted to rebuke Trump’s Canada tariffs two weeks ago, said the levies are “terrible politics for Republicans” and that Trump’s latest move “will also fail in the courts.”</p> 
<p>“President Trump is putting a ball and chain” on the GOP in the midterms, Bacon told POLITICO. “I hate seeing it.”</p> 
<p><b>— DHS stalemate:&nbsp;</b>The DHS shutdown appeared to get real over the weekend when the department said it would suspend TSA PreCheck and other airport security services, but then quickly reversed course “based off of conversations the secretary had with the White House and TSA,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2026/02/21/tsa-precheck-global-entry-shutdown/" target="_blank">according to the Washington Post</a>. Officials still plan to pause airport courtesy escorts for members of Congress as well as Global Entry.</p> 
<p>The White House and Democrats are entering the week without substantial public evidence of progress on an agreement to fund DHS and establish immigration enforcement guardrails. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday that the administration is “choosing to inflict pain on the public instead of adopting common sense ICE reforms.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p>House Rules will take up two bills to roll back Biden-era efficiency standards at 4 p.m.<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican tariff skeptics on Capitol Hill celebrated Friday after the<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-ruling-00790687" target="_blank">Supreme Court struck down</a> the core authority behind President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs — dealing a blow to a major plank of the president’s agenda but offering a welcome off-ramp to GOP lawmakers who viewed the levies as a political loser.</p> 
<p>Retiring Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) broke with Trump and GOP leaders a week ago to help<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/house-rebukes-trumps-canada-tariffs-00776898" target="_blank">overturn Trump’s Canada tariffs</a>. On Friday, he hailed the “common sense ruling” by the high court that essentially invalidates those and many other tariffs.</p> 
<p>“The checks and balances our Constitution puts in place works,” Bacon said in an interview Friday morning shortly after the decision, adding, “I feel vindicated.”</p> 
<p>Another Republican who backed the effort to overturn the Canada tariffs, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, also praised the ruling.</p> 
<p>“On its face, this case was obvious, because the Constitution vests the power to tax with the legislative branch, not the Executive branch,” Massie said in a text message. “No contrived emergency can undo that.”</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped any praise or criticism of the ruling, saying that Trump’s tariffs had “brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America’s trade strategy.”</p> 
<p>“Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” he <a href="https://x.com/speakerjohnson/status/2024892242930884617?s=46" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p> 
<p>Johnson later Friday postponed a trade briefing for a group of House Republicans, including tariff skeptics, that he had scheduled for Monday evening, according to three people granted anonymity to describe the private plans.</p> 
<p>The lawmakers were set to meet in the speaker's office with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has played a lead role in assuaging wary Republicans about Trump's sweeping tariff regime as Democrats push to bring the matter to the House floor. A staffer in the speaker’s office said a new date and time for the discussion would be set “soon.”</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) in a statement said his members would "continue working with the administration and our colleagues in the House to advance our shared goal to strengthen rural America, including South Dakota’s farm and ranch communities, and the broader U.S. economy."</p> 
<p>But Trump, during a news conference Friday afternoon, made clear he had no interest in engaging Congress further on the matter. In announcing his plans to slap a new "10% global tariff" on goods coming into the U.S., Trump said he would not ask lawmakers to take additional action: "I don't need to. It's already been approved. I mean — I would ask Congress and probably get it."</p> 
<p>He added, "I have the right to do tariffs. And I've always had the right to do tariffs." </p> 
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump appeared visibly upset at the decision, according to two people in the room granted anonymity to describe the private event, cutting short remarks he was delivering to governors upon hearing the news at a White House breakfast Friday morning.</p> 
<p>“He was not happy. He got the info in real time,” one of the people said.</p> 
<p>The ruling comes just four days before Trump is set to deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress and an audience that will include the Supreme Court justices who rebuffed the cornerstone of his economic and foreign policy agendas. Trump said during his Friday news conference that the six justices who ruled against his tariffs were "barely" invited to the address and "I couldn't care less if they come."</p> 
<p>A few GOP backers of the tariffs quickly spoke out, with Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio decrying the ruling as “outrageous” and saying it “handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades.”</p> 
<p>“These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up. Now globalists win,” Moreno added in a social media post Friday.</p> 
<p>The ruling also prompted tough questions for both parties about what comes next. Bacon indicated the decision could put an end to a flood of additional tariff disapproval votes headed to the House floor in the coming weeks.</p> 
<p>“We’ll see if it’s necessary,” he said.</p> 
<p>But House Democrats could keep hammering Republicans on the topic in the weeks ahead. Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat who has orchestrated the tariff disapproval votes, said he would “continue to review the SCOTUS ruling to assess future legislative steps,” though there are no plans at the moment to force additional disapproval votes next week, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy.</p> 
<p>Senate Democrats, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss private strategy, are waiting to see how Trump responds to the decision before determining whether to force more votes disapproving of individual emergency declarations.</p> 
<p>Democrats in the Senate had hoped to put up the House-passed Canada resolution for a vote in the coming weeks, but there are ongoing internal conversations over whether it qualifies for special fast-track procedures allowing for a quick simple-majority vote, according to a second person granted anonymity to describe the matter.</p> 
<p>Other Democrats said further action was needed to forestall the Trump administration from sidestepping the ruling, possibly by invoking separate national security powers. Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington, who chairs the House Democratic campaign arm and sits on the chamber’s main trade panel, noted that the White House “has promised to use other avenues to maintain these illegal tariffs.”</p> 
<p>“Congress must step up to put an end to this chaos and protect our economy,” she added.</p> 
<p>Asked about the prospect of Trump trying to implement his tariffs through other avenues, Bacon said, “I think they’ll try, but it would not be advisable.” Friday’s ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts broadly defended Congress’ sole power under the Constitution to levy taxes.</p> 
<p>Congress might also end up having to wrangle with the question of whether refunds are due to businesses or consumers who paid levies now found to be illegal.</p> 
<p>“The Court has struck down these destructive tariffs, but there is no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) noted in a statement. “Instead, giant corporations with their armies of lawyers and lobbyists can sue for tariff refunds, then just pocket the money for themselves.”</p> 
<p>Some Republicans are also urging congressional action in response to the ruling, with Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, who chairs the Select Committee on China, pressing for a revocation of Beijing’s permanent normal trade relations status.</p> 
<p>But to the handful of GOP lawmakers who stuck to their free-trade guns as Trump unleashed his global tariff campaign, the overwhelming sentiment has been relief and praise for the high court.</p> 
<p>Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.), who joined Bacon and Massie in opposing the Canada tariffs last week, said in an interview that the ruling was “an example of our institution working” and called on Congress to set trade policy in concert with Trump.</p> 
<p>“We need to make sure that when it comes to trade policy that we have stability and predictability,” he said. “And the way that we get that predictability and stability is through congressional action.”</p> 
<p>Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who orchestrated the confirmations of several justices who participated in the ruling in his former role as Republican leader, said the justices “reaffirmed authority that has rested with Congress for centuries.”</p> 
<p>“If the executive would like to enact trade policies that impact American producers and consumers, its path forward is crystal clear,” he said in a statement. “Convince their representatives under Article 1” of the Constitution.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump sent a clear message to congressional Republicans this month that there’s no need to pass another party-line megabill this year. Many, however, aren’t ready to give up yet.</p> 
<p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/trump-reconciliation-package-00774834" target="_blank">comments in a Fox Business Network interview</a> earlier this month appeared to finally settle a long-running GOP debate over whether to pursue a follow-up to the “big, beautiful bill” enacted in July, saying “we’ve gotten everything passed that we need.”</p> 
<p>But some lawmakers are insisting that the filibuster-skirting budget reconciliation process <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/24/gop-reconciliation-bill-health-care-00704698" target="_blank">offers an unmissable opportunity</a> for Republicans to enact major conservative policy changes ahead of the midterm elections — and that there is still a window to get it done.</p> 
<p>Those Republicans are largely brushing off Trump’s comments, refusing to take them as a death knell for their efforts.</p> 
<p>“One day he’s okay with it, and the next day he’s not,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260075" data-person-id="260075">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.), who is one of the loudest evangelists for passing another party-line bill before the midterms, arguing Republicans “haven’t done a damn thing” since last year’s effort.</p> 
<p>Those attitudes threaten to extend the will-they-or-won’t-they discussion for potentially several more months as some factions keep pressure on GOP leaders to keep hope alive.</p> 
<p>The influential Republican Study Committee, which includes scores of House conservatives, has been holding listening sessions since last August for what could go into "Reconciliation 2.0.” It <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/13/congress/rsc-reconciliation-framework-megabill-00724594" target="_blank">put out a framework in January</a> outlining how such a bill could fulfill an ambitious housing, health care and energy agenda. The group is not yet abandoning the effort.</p> 
<p>“There's always a chance until there's not,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/306850" data-person-id="306850">Kevin Hern</a> (R-Okla.), a former RSC chair and member of House GOP leadership.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/355320" data-person-id="355320">August Pfluger</a> (R-Texas), the RSC's current chair, said in a statement that a second reconciliation bill would be “the perfect vehicle” to unite Republicans behind “Trump’s America First agenda in 2026.”</p> 
<p>“This is our moment, and we intend to make the most of it,” he said.</p> 
<p>But to many senior Republicans that amounts to false hope — and a distraction from other matters on the congressional agenda in the coming months. Hopes abound for progress on bipartisan housing, permitting and transportation bills.</p> 
<p>It was a particularly grueling process to get the first megabill through both chambers last year — and leaders had $5 trillion worth of tax cuts to dangle in front of recalcitrant members to help push it along.</p> 
<p>House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/03/house-passes-gop-megabill-00438206" target="_blank">barely passed the bill</a> on party lines in July, and their margin has only decreased since: They can currently afford no more than one defection.</p> 
<p>“I would love a second reconciliation bill, but I can count votes,” Ways and Means Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192689" data-person-id="192689">Jason Smith</a> (R-Mo.) said in an interview. “And we do not have the votes for a second reconciliation.”</p> 
<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> and other House GOP leaders insist they haven’t ruled out doing a second reconciliation bill and say it's still an active discussion, even as some senior House Republicans and GOP leadership aides privately doubt they will ever have the votes to move forward.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> also hasn’t dismissed another bill — but privately there’s a hefty dose of skepticism among senators and aides that there’s much of an appetite for another big party-line heave.</p> 
<p>Asked about Trump’s latest comments, Thune acknowledged in an interview that there’s interest among some members. But he added that Republicans have to be “realistic” about the prospects of assembling a proposal that can garner 51 GOP votes and withstand a free-for-all of politically tricky changes from Democrats.</p> 
<p>“We have to have a reason to do it,” Thune added.</p> 
<p>To get another bill across the finish line during a midterm year, Republicans would likely need Trump to articulate what precisely he wants in a bill and then for the president to spend weeks, and potentially months, trying to help round up the votes.</p> 
<p>But Trump has expressed skepticism about reconciliation, further raising the likelihood that the prospects of another bill are DOA. In addition to his recent comments, he kvetched about how little can actually get done in a reconciliation bill during a meeting with Senate Republicans last fall, instead urging Republicans to break the filibuster — a nonstarter for a significant swath of the conference.</p> 
<p>Trump rekindled that push Thursday, telling senators in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116099119307195442" target="_blank">Truth Social post</a> to pass a GOP elections bill by insisting on a “talking filibuster” that would theoretically force Democrats to hold the floor indefinitely. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill, but many Republicans aren’t interested in skirting the chamber’s 60-vote supermajority requirement for most legislation.</p> 
<p>The intraparty division is expected to come to a head next month at the House Republican retreat in south Florida, where a second reconciliation bill will be a topic of conversation. A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/24/gop-reconciliation-bill-health-care-00704698" target="_blank">previous closed-door meeting</a> of GOP lawmakers in December grew heated, with vulnerable Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/390300" data-person-id="390300">Mike Lawler</a> (R-N.Y.) saying it would “never” happen.</p> 
<p>Reconciliation got a brief mention during a Senate GOP retreat earlier this month, but most of the focus was on a slate of bipartisan bills that could come up this year, as well as the need to promote last year’s megabill, according to attendees who were granted anonymity to describe the closed-door event.</p> 
<p>But some Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee — including Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51186" data-person-id="51186">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) — are pushing for more. Graham has told his members that he plans to move forward with a budget resolution that would tee up a second reconciliation bill aimed at beefing up military and border spending, addressing health care costs and targeting fraud in social services.</p> 
<p>But according to his committee members, Graham hasn’t given a strict timeline for when he’ll start moving, and there’s skepticism that it will amount to much without GOP leaders’ involvement.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know how you move forward without the majority leader’s okay,” Kennedy said in an interview. “Senator Thune wants us to only work on bipartisan bills. I love Senator Thune like a taco, but he needs to back off the crank if he believes that. There aren’t going to be any bipartisan bills — we’re right in the middle of the midterm election. Our one shot to get something is reconciliation.”</p> 
<p>One of the other challenges is litigating what exactly would go into a second reconciliation bill.</p> 
<p>Senate conservatives have floated taking another crack at healthcare, but that would risk exposing deep GOP divisions just months before the midterms. Many of the party’s most unifying health care proposals were omitted from last year’s megabill because of the Senate’s strict rules governing reconciliation.</p> 
<p>Some senior House Republicans have discussed attempting to codify Trump’s tariffs in another party-line bill. But that long-shot effort is now effectively dead after six Republicans voted this month to reject Trump’s levies on Canadian imports — with more such tariff votes to come.</p> 
<p>Asked about the possibility of codifying tariffs in a party-line package, Smith reiterated in an interview, “There's not going to be a second reconciliation bill.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address next week, Democratic Minority Leaders <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> announced Thursday.</p> 
<p>Sen. Schumer said Spanberger “has always put service over politics,” and Rep. Jeffries praised Spanberger for her decisive victory in November’s election.</p> 
<p>“She stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening,” Jeffries said.</p> 
<p>In a statement, Spanberger said Americans expect and deserve “leaders who are working hard to deliver for them.”</p> 
<p>“We are at a defining moment in our nation’s history,” she said. “Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring.”</p> 
<p>Spanberger <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/spanberger-wins-virginia-governors-race-00633606" target="_blank">flipped Virginia’s governor’s mansion blue</a> last year, becoming the state’s first female governor. She previously represented the commonwealth’s 7th District in the House. Before her time in politics, Spanberger served in the CIA.</p> 
<p>The two minority leaders also announced Thursday that Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189610" data-person-id="189610">Alex Padilla</a> (D-Calif.) will deliver the Democratic response in Spanish on Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants and California's first Latino senator, garnered nationwide attention last summer after he was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/12/california-sen-alex-padilla-handcuffed-at-noem-presser-00403253" target="_blank">forcibly detained</a> by officers during a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p> 
<p>“As Donald Trump, Kristi Noem and MAGA extremists have tried to silence the voices of our Latino brothers and sisters, Senator Alex Padilla has consistently fought back and proven Democrats will not bend the knee to this out-of-control administration,” Jeffries said.</p> 
<p>Schumer added that Padilla’s message will be a “sharp contrast to President Trump’s chaos and self-dealing.”</p> 
<p>Padilla said he plans to discuss lowering costs, safeguarding democracy and reining in “rogue federal agencies" in his speech.</p> 
<p>“Americans don’t need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating Constitutional rights on a daily basis,” Padilla said.</p> 
<p>Trump will address the nation from the Capitol on Tuesday, though a swath of Democrats have announced <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/18/democrats-trump-state-of-the-union-boycott-00786370" target="_blank">they plan to boycott the address</a>. Jeffries, however, told reporters Wednesday that he plans to attend Trump’s speech.</p> 
<p>“We’re not going to Donald Trump’s house, he’s coming to our house,” Jeffries said. “It’s my view that you don’t let anyone ever run you off of your block.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a rare move, Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) is reaching across party lines to endorse his wife, Susanne Shore, who announced Thursday that she is running as a Democrat for a seat on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents.</p> 
<p>Ricketts said in a statement that his wife would be an “outstanding voice” for the university, noting her love for Nebraska and their shared goals of making higher education more affordable and accessible.</p> 
<p>“I usually vote straight Republican, but Susanne will be my one Democrat exception in 2026!” he said.</p> 
<p>The former Nebraskan first lady is seeking an Omaha seat representing Douglas County after former Regent Elizabeth O’Connor resigned in January following a charge of felony DUI. Shore described herself as a “Regent-ready” candidate, pointing to her background in university administration, health care and public service.</p> 
<p>“Our university must be an engine, not a museum,” she said in a statement. “By focusing on results over rhetoric, we can keep our university affordable, competitive and ready for the challenges of the future.”</p> 
<p>The political split between the former two-term governor and his wife has been apparent for more than a decade. The two donate to opposing parties and have even backed candidates running against one another. Shore acknowledged the dynamic, saying differences at home are routine but respectful. In an <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2026/02/19/former-nebraska-first-lady-susanne-shore-runs-for-nu-regent-in-omaha/" target="_blank">interview with the Nebraska Examiner</a>, Shore said Ricketts has been “nothing but supportive” of her political aspirations.</p> 
<p>“He’s told me what it’s like to run for office, and I’ve seen it firsthand,” she said. “It does feel different to be on this side, but so far it’s been amazing.”</p> 
<p>Shore said her husband has his own campaign to worry about. He’s facing off against Dan Osborn, an independent and former Omaha labor leader, in a competitive Nebraska Senate race.</p> 
<p>Ricketts has been a loyal supporter of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, backing the administration on many of its key issues. He was, however, one of the few Republicans to criticize Trump after he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/donald-trump-obamas-monkey-video-00768745" target="_blank">posted a racist video to social media</a> depicting former President and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama as monkeys earlier this month.</p> 
<p>“Even if this was a Lion King meme, a reasonable person sees the racist context to this,” <a href="https://x.com/SenatorRicketts/status/2019814293366272277?s=20" target="_blank">he wrote on X</a>. “The White House should do what anyone does when they make a mistake: remove this and apologize.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of Donald Trump's biggest loyalists in Congress are itching to rein in federal surveillance powers. So far his administration isn't biting.</p> 
<p>Instead, the White House is quietly pushing for a key spy authority to be extended as is into 2027, according to five people granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. The length of that “clean” extension is still under discussion, but the administration wants at least 18 months, according to three of the people.</p> 
<p>Stephen Miller, the influential senior White House domestic policy adviser, is a leading advocate within the administration for extending the program that lets the government collect the data of noncitizens abroad without a warrant, according to two of the five people. One of the people said that Miller sees the spying statute under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as critical to a variety of homeland security missions.</p> 
<p>The behind-the-scenes push comes as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/31/section-702-donald-trump-surveillance-00708042" target="_blank">Congress barrels toward an April 20 deadline</a> to reauthorize Section 702, which is itself a perennial source of intraparty tension for the GOP. Even as some Hill Republicans believe that Trump supports a clean extension, others cautioned there are still two months to go and things will remain in flux until the president weighs in publicly — underscoring the fraught nature of the discussion.</p> 
<p>But if Trump embraces the view held by Miller and other administration officials, it would be a major win for the intelligence community and its allies in Congress, who have fretted for months that Trump’s stated hatred of the broader FISA law could tank hopes of getting any reauthorization of the warrantless spy provision over the finish line.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, it’s likely to be a major problem for Speaker Mike Johnson, a former Judiciary Committee member who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/29/trump-conservatives-spy-power-00154619" target="_blank">frustrated conservative hard-liners in 2024</a> when he sided with the Intelligence Committee and cast the deciding vote to reject a new policy requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant before searching for Americans under Section 702 surveillance.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders are involved in conversations with House Republicans about how to reauthorize the program, but there is not yet a consensus on how to move forward ahead of the April deadline.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, there’s no easy path to pass a clean extension in the House. One of the people with knowledge of the discussions said GOP leaders are “going to have a problem” trying to unite Republicans behind a special “rule” allowing for an up-or-down floor vote on a clean extension, which are typically party-line affairs.</p> 
<p>But Republicans also believe that with Trump in office, a number of Democrats who previously supported leaving Section 702 intact will now support putting more fetters on intelligence agencies — making the alternative route, a two-thirds-majority bipartisan vote under suspension of the rules, all but impossible.</p> 
<p>Asked about trying to pass a clean 702 extension, House Intelligence Committee Chair Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) said in an interview that “we’re still shopping that.”</p> 
<p>“I have a responsibility to … run the play that the coach calls, so we'll see,” he said, acknowledging that while he’s “not a mathematician” that it’s unlikely any bill will be able to clear the two-thirds hurdle for speedy passage.</p> 
<p>Across the Capitol, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has been pitching a clean 18-month extension, with some members of his panel interested in going even longer. But lawmakers have also grown frustrated after administration officials were evasive about their position in recent Capitol Hill meetings, with one person saying Wednesday they still had not been informed of the White House’s official posture.</p> 
<p>Intelligence officials have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/28/biden-surveillance-program-republicans-bush-00094435" target="_blank">argued in public</a> that the 702 program is critical to stopping a wide range of national security threats, from narcotics trafficking and weapons proliferation to cyberattacks and terrorism. U.S. spy agencies are also <a href="https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702-documents/FISA_Section_702_Vignettes-20240214_Final.pdf" target="_blank">authorized to use the authority</a> to vet foreigners trying to enter the country or seeking certain benefits under federal immigration law.</p> 
<p>Miller <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/22/drug-boats-strikes-cia-legal-concerns/" target="_blank">was one of the architects</a> of the Trump administration's policy of bombing suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific under the controversial legal theory that their crews were “combatants” in an armed conflict against the U.S.</p> 
<p>The White House did not provide a comment about its position on extending the program. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Beyond the surveillance policy itself, any 702 extension will face other problems getting through the House: Trying to pass a bill under a rule would give an opportunity to Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and her allies to make good on their threat to attach a partisan voting bill, the SAVE America Act. If that effort were successful, it would kill the ability for Republicans to get the Democratic votes they will inevitably need to pass the legislation in the House.</p> 
<p>Lawmakers at the heart of the debate know they are quickly running out of time to figure out a strategy. The House is planning to be out of session for three of the coming eight weeks before Section 702 expires.</p> 
<p>“April 20 is the deadline, so we've got to work fast,” Crawford said, adding that “obviously the White House has vested interest in retaining 702, authority. It's a national security issue. So, you know, it's very important to them.”</p> 
<p>Crawford and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) are in talks over a potential compromise effort that could put new guardrails on Section 702 surveillance. They’ve participated in a joint meeting at the White House and held staff dinners to try and feel out a compromise — which would be a huge relief for Johnson if it could come together.</p> 
<p>But the two panels have historically diverged, particularly on the warrant issue. There’s already skepticism that Jordan or his panel’s members will drop their demands to require warrants in relation to Americans caught in the surveillance data just because the White House is pushing for a clean extension.</p> 
<p>Jordan <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/31/section-702-donald-trump-surveillance-00708042" target="_blank">indicated to POLITICO late last year</a> that he was hoping to get a warrant requirement written into law, along with a separate proposal banning data brokers from selling information to law enforcement without a warrant.</p> 
<p>But he was more general in comments last week, where he noted there are ongoing conversations about possible additional changes Congress could make while also offering a more measured assessment of the overall program.</p> 
<p>“We know 702 is important,” Jordan said. “We know it needs to get reauthorized. We're committed to getting that done. We just want to do it in the best way possible so that you can get the bad guys, know what the bad guys are doing overseas, but also protect Americans, and I'm confident we'll get there.”</p> 
<p>But some hard-liners in both chambers are as insistent as ever on the need for a warrant requirement.</p> 
<p>Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) asked Attorney General Pam Bondi about it during her appearance last week before the House Judiciary Committee. And Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said Congress "has no business" reauthorizing Section 702 without adding a warrant requirement for searches involving U.S. persons — a provision that supporters of the program believe would be unworkable.</p> 
<p>Lee and Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, are planning to revive a bill that would extend Section 702 with changes, including a warrant requirement for searching the content of communications involving Americans, according to a person granted anonymity to disclose the unannounced effort.</p> 
<p>“I think a lot of members still want to be able to have some semblance of a warrant requirement when it comes to FISA 702 uses,” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) said. “I don't really see that changing anytime soon.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Les Wexner, a billionaire businessman and former client of Jeffrey Epstein, said in a statement shared Wednesday with members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee he had no contact with Epstein after the sex offender’s first conviction — nor did he have any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes.</p> 
<p>“I completely and irrevocably cut ties with Epstein nearly twenty years ago when I learned that he was an abuser, a crook, and a liar,” Wexner, the Ohio-based founder of L Brands, said in the statement obtained by POLITICO. “And, let me be crystal clear: I never witnessed nor had any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activity.”</p> 
<p>Wexner, in compliance with a congressional subpoena, testified behind closed doors in New Albany, Ohio, as part of the Oversight panel’s investigation into Epstein and the Justice Department’s handling of the case.</p> 
<p>A longtime Republican donor, Wexner has become a central figure in the fallout over the so-called Epstein files after he was listed in DOJ materials as a potential secondary co-conspirator — though <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00175080.pdf" target="_blank">the memo also said</a> there was “limited evidence regarding his involvement,” and he has not been charged in the case.</p> 
<p>House Democrats, speaking during the deposition, sought to portray Wexner as a key enabler of Epstein’s crimes.</p> 
<p>Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, said Epstein’s victims had expressed concern about the “enormous amount of money” Wexner transferred to Epstein — potentially over a billion dollars, Garcia claimed.</p> 
<p>“There is no single person that was more involved in providing Jeffrey Epstein with the financial support to commit his crimes than Les Wexner,” Garcia told reporters in Ohio. “Mr. Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was without the support of Les Wexner.”</p> 
<p>Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said that throughout the deposition, Wexner claimed to know less and less about his relationship with Epstein.</p> 
<p>“There was a deep trust between these two men,” he said. “There was a deep friendship there.”</p> 
<p>No Republican lawmakers were present for the deposition, with Committee Chair James Comer unable to attend due to previously scheduled oral surgery, according to a spokesperson.</p> 
<p>According to the statement provided to the House panel, Wexner said his formal relationship with Epstein began after Epstein offered to provide financial advice as a personal favor — a gesture Wexner said he has come to believe was a move to gain his trust. Wexner later hired Epstein in an official capacity to oversee his personal finances and gave him power of attorney.</p> 
<p>“Over the course of many years, [Epstein] carefully used his acquaintance with important individuals to curate an aura of legitimacy that he then used to expand his network of acquaintances, and apparent credibility, even farther,” said Wexner’s written statement.</p> 
<p>As the case against Epstein in the 2000’s ballooned and it became clear that Epstein had been stealing from Wexner’s family, the two men severed ties entirely, Wexner said. Epstein transferred some money back to Wexner’s family but never admitted to wrongdoing, Wexner added.</p> 
<p>Wexner also maintained he had never been unfaithful to his wife over more than three decades together.</p> 
<p>A Oversight Committee spokesperson said in a statement that Wexner answered every question during the deposition, and the panel would soon release a video and transcript of the interview.</p> 
<p>“Mr. Wexner honestly answered every question put to him today by the Committee,” a Wexner spokesperson also said in a statement after the deposition had concluded. “Mr. Wexner reiterated that he has no knowledge of, and did not participate in, Epstein’s illegal conduct. He stands by that fervently.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A slate of Democrats plan to skip President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address to Congress next week and instead will attend a counterprogramming event on the National Mall that same evening.</p> 
<p>The rally, dubbed the “People’s State of the Union,” will include lawmakers who skipped Trump’s first and second inaugurations, underscoring a small but consistent block of Democrats who continue to opt out of the president’s most high-profile events.</p> 
<p>Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51500" data-person-id="51500">Ed Markey</a> (D-Mass.), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66836" data-person-id="66836">Jeff Merkley</a> (D-Ore.), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51493" data-person-id="51493">Chris Murphy</a> (D-Conn.), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/282320" data-person-id="282320">Tina Smith</a> (D-Minn.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51658" data-person-id="51658">Chris Van Hollen</a> (D-Md.) and Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/478829" data-person-id="478829">Yassamin Ansari</a> (D-Ariz.), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/239019" data-person-id="239019">Becca Balint</a> (D-Vt.), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/418214" data-person-id="418214">Greg Casar</a> (D-Texas), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/304660" data-person-id="304660">Veronica Escobar</a> (D-Texas), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/239242" data-person-id="239242">Pramila Jayapal</a> (D-Wash.), <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/312750" data-person-id="312750">Delia Ramirez</a> (D-Ill.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196528" data-person-id="196528">Bonnie Watson Coleman</a> (D-N.J.) are expected to join the rally, organizers said Wednesday.</p> 
<p>“These aren’t normal times and showing up for this speech puts a veneer of legitimacy on the corruption and lawlessness that has defined his second term,” Murphy said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Ansari, who walked out of Trump’s address to Congress last year, said the rally continues her earlier protest. </p> 
<p>“Americans deserve an honest account of the state of our union,” she said. </p> 
<p>She said she plans to bring in a guest who was targeted by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p> 
<p>The liberal group MoveOn is hosting the rally alongside other organizations, including the popular Democratic-aligned podcasting and media network MeidasTouch.</p> 
<p>The White House dismissed the boycott, saying Democrats have routinely worked to thwart the administration's policy goals.</p> 
<p>“It’s not a surprise that they refuse to celebrate and honor the Americans who have benefited from the commonsense policies Republicans have governed with,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.</p> 
<p>Democrats have boycotted a series of Trump’s biggest moments throughout both of his terms. Of the dozens of House Democrats who skipped Trump’s first inauguration, 31 were still in Congress and <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/democrats-trump-inauguration-boycott-plans/" target="_blank">seven chose to attend</a> his second one, signaling a faded resistance from the first Trump era.</p> 
<p>Trump is set to deliver his address Tuesday night, even as a partial government shutdown continues, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/13/trump-state-of-the-union-shutdown-00781266" target="_blank">prompting concerns from some senior Hill Republicans and White House officials</a> about the optics. </p> 
<p>But Republicans also see the address as an opportunity to shift the focus away from mounting negative headlines — including fatal shootings by federal immigration agents in Minnesota and scrutiny over the release of the Epstein files — and instead bolster its economic messaging ahead of the midterms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is pushing Congress to end mail voting as Americans have come to know it. So far, Republican lawmakers aren’t heeding his calls.</p> 
<p>Trump has long railed against the expansion of vote-by-mail, arguing despite scant evidence that it is rife with fraud and suggesting it was responsible in part for his 2020 election loss. Since retaking office, he has repeatedly called for action — most recently Monday night to reporters on Air Force One.</p> 
<p>“Why would you want mail-in ballots if you know it's corrupt?” Trump said. “It's a corrupt system.”</p> 
<p>But other Republicans don’t see it that way — many of their own voters have voted by mail consistently for decades. So far, the type of blanket ban on mail voting Trump wants has not gained traction on Capitol Hill as GOP lawmakers counsel for a more targeted approach.</p> 
<p>“I support the use of mail-in voting,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican facing a tight reelection contest. “The idea that some states just mail out ballots without any requests is absurd, but the use of mail-in balloting, I do not have an objection.”</p> 
<p>A sweeping elections bill the House passed last week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/save-america-act-passes-house-00777405" target="_blank">the SAVE America Act</a>, included strict <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/house-save-act-vote-filibuster-00768499" target="_blank">proof-of-citizenship requirements</a> for voter registration and new photo-ID rules for casting ballots.</p> 
<p>But it did not address voting by mail — even though Trump publicly called for a crackdown in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116035773358024034" target="_blank">Truth Social post</a> just three days before the vote: “NO MAIL-IN BALLOTS (EXCEPT FOR ILLNESS, DISABILITY, MILITARY, OR TRAVEL!)”</p> 
<p>Behind the scenes, the White House pushed to include language in the bill that would prohibit mail-in voting, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the issue. But that risked losing support from some Republicans and endangering the bill’s ability to pass the narrowly divided House, and it was ultimately left out.</p> 
<p>A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/saveamerica/" target="_blank">White House website</a> touting the bill still lists “No Mail-in Ballots” as one of its features.</p> 
<p>Asked about the discrepancy, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Trump “has repeatedly urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.”</p> 
<p>Several House Republicans said in interviews over the past week they sympathized with Trump’s push to crack down on mailed ballots, but many couched their words carefully. A number hail from states like Florida that have a long history of expansive mail voting and little evidence that the practice has been abused.</p> 
<p>Even as the president pushed to curtail mailed ballots, the RNC and state Republican parties worked to take advantage of the practice during the 2024 campaign to increase voter turnout — and they are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/republicans-midterms-mail-in-voting-00693867" target="_blank">planning to do much the same in 2026</a>.</p> 
<p>Instead, many congressional Republicans insist that Trump is really targeting states like California, Oregon and Utah that conduct their elections almost entirely by mail. Others emphasize the need for exceptions, as Trump has acknowledged, for cases of illness, military service and other reasons they view as legitimate, as well as the other election changes Trump is backing.</p> 
<p>“We have to be very cautious about mail-in-ballot voting,” Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) said in an interview. “But I think that if we get the registration process correct, then that'll fix a lot of this.”</p> 
<p>GOP Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida, said his state's laws should serve as a model for the country. Florida voters have to request a mail-in ballot and include identification. But there is no limitation on who can request a mail ballot along the lines of what Trump is proposing.</p> 
<p>“In Florida, we treat ballots like they're evidence in a trial,” Donalds said. “Other states need to follow that. … I think that's what the White House is referencing. You just can't have ballots out there in the ether.”</p> 
<p>Another elections bill moving through the House, the <a href="https://cha.house.gov/2026/1/chairman-steil-unveils-the-make-elections-great-again-act" target="_blank">Make Elections Great Again Act</a>, does include provisions dealing with mail voting — including language aimed at preventing “ballot harvesting” where third parties collect ballots on voters’ behalf. It would also ban “universal” vote-by-mail where ballots are sent to all registered voters — but would not narrow who could request a mailed ballot.</p> 
<p>That policy appears to be more in keeping with what most GOP lawmakers envision for an elections overhaul — and they insist that is what Trump in fact supports.</p> 
<p>“If you're sick and you can't get to the polling [place], he wants you to have a ballot. If you're a military member, he wants you to have a ballot,” Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) said of the president. “Who he doesn't want to have a ballot is the illegal alien that registered or even a lawful alien who got a driver's license to be registered to vote and get a mail-in ballot.”</p> 
<p>The MEGA Act is sponsored by House Administration Committee Chair Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) and was the subject of a recent hearing. But it has not yet moved through the panel or been scheduled for the House floor.</p> 
<p>The SAVE America Act also appears likely to stall in the Senate, despite a conservative effort to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/senate-filibuster-gop-save-act-00775393" target="_blank">utilize a so-called talking filibuster</a> to skirt Democratic opposition there.</p> 
<p>Trump appears to be recognizing the obstacles to his elections agenda on Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116065471857020644" target="_blank">Friday Truth Social post</a>, he suggested he would take executive action to implement “Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not,” while also mentioning “No Mail-In Ballots, with exceptions for Military, Disability, Illness, or Travel.”</p> 
<p>But to Republicans like Lawler, who voted for the SAVE America Act and is facing a tough reelection fight this year, the GOP’s efforts going forward would be best spent making sure “people get out and vote.”</p> 
<p>“If they vote by mail, if they vote early, if they vote on Election Day, the objective is to get them out and vote,” he said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is barreling ahead with the first State of the Union address of his second term, despite concerns among Republicans that it’s set to hit during a partial government shutdown.</p> 
<p>The speech, set for 11 days from now, is poised to land in the middle of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/congress-shutdown-dhs-ice-00779881" target="_blank">a funding lapse at the Department of Homeland Security</a> – the product of a standoff with Democrats over immigration enforcement that the White House had hoped to avoid. Behind the scenes, some administration officials and senior Capitol Hill Republicans are quietly fretting about the optics, according to six people granted anonymity to describe private conversations.</p> 
<p>The concerned Republicans believe it would be less than ideal for Trump to stand in the well of the House and declare that the state of the union is strong when a critical part of the federal government remains shuttered.</p> 
<p>“It doesn't exactly scream ‘a functioning GOP trifecta,’” said one House Republican granted anonymity to speak candidly.</p> 
<p>Asked whether postponing the address was under discussion, a senior White House official said Friday, “Not as of yet.” Senior Hill Republicans believe the president is full steam ahead as well. In 2019, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/17/trump-pelosi-letter-1108470" target="_blank">Trump publicly battled</a> with then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi for more than a week over whether to delay his State of the Union address during an earlier government shutdown. He eventually relented.</p> 
<p>Republicans expect Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, who is responsible for extending the formal invitation to the president to address a joint session of Congress, not to delay the speech unless the White House specifically asks.</p> 
<p>The latest shutdown, which will begin when DHS funding lapses overnight, is expected to drag on until at least the week of Trump’s Feb. 24 State of the Union speech because the White House and Senate Democrats appear to be far apart on how far to rein in Trump’s immigration enforcement activities as part of a funding agreement.</p> 
<p>Both sides are continuing to negotiate, but lawmakers left Washington Thursday for a week-long recess with little expectation they would be called back early. The address is scheduled for one day after lawmakers return to Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>White House officials and senior Hill Republicans have been eager for Trump to use the prime time address to tamp down a swirl of negative headlines over the past few weeks, from the fatal shootings by federal immigration agents in Minnesota to the release of the files of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. They instead want to focus on the GOP’s economic messaging heading into the midterms.</p> 
<p>Some Republicans also see it as an opportunity to blame Democrats for the DHS funding lapse, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/dhs-shutdown-impact-furloughs-00775499" target="_blank">which impacts TSA baggage screeners</a>, who will work without pay, FEMA and the Coast Guard.</p> 
<p>“President Trump has been, and always will be, on the side of the American people,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Fox News interview Friday. “He wants our government to remain open, and unfortunately, it appears that Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons.”</p> 
<p>Among the considerations for Republicans is how difficult Democrats plan to make things for Trump during the speech itself. Senate Democrats are having discussions about whether to boycott the event and talked it over during a closed-door lunch this week, according to two people granted anonymity to share details of the private conversations. Some members of the caucus are currently expected to attend, though a swath is undecided.</p> 
<p>House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> on Friday declined to say whether he believed the speech should go forward during a DHS shutdown.</p> 
<p>“That's an open question,” he told reporters. “We'll have more to say about that next week.”</p> 
<p>Jeffries advised Democrats during a private leadership meeting earlier this week that his members should either sit in “silent defiance” or attend alternative programming, according to two people granted anonymity to describe his comments.</p> 
<p>Heckling has become increasingly common from a president’s political opponents during State of the Union speeches.</p> 
<p>Johnson pleaded with his own members to maintain decorum during former President Joe Biden’s 2024 State of the Union appearance, only for several House GOP hard-liners <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/07/bidens-gop-hecklers-vent-their-fury-over-the-border-and-more-00145938" target="_blank"><u>to openly taunt him</u></a>. During Trump’s address to Congress last year, Democrats showed up with signage and jeers, with multiple members walking out either on their own accord or at the insistence of Capitol Police.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51410" data-person-id="51410">Al Green</a> (D-Texas), who stood up to yell at the president at the very beginning of Trump’s speech last year, was later censured by the House for his actions.</p> 
<p>Asked Thursday whether he would attend this year’s State of the Union address, Green said, “I’m not making an announcement right now.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump spent the past year using fear and intimidation to keep Hill Republicans in line, with considerable success. Now those tactics are starting to lose their bite — thanks to a small group of Republicans with nothing to lose.</p> 
<p>The reasons why this handful of GOP lawmakers feel empowered to spurn their president and their party vary. But they are launching mini-rebellions with increasing frequency. It’s causing headaches for party leaders who want to keep tight control of the legislative agenda in an election year and anxiety among rank-and-file Republicans who are facing intense pressure to stick with Trump.</p> 
<p>“Some people live in fear,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a retiring Nebraska Republican who was at the center of a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/house-tariff-votes-republicans-affordability-00777567" target="_blank">crucial episode this past week</a>, where he and two colleagues joined with Democrats to force House votes on Trump’s controversial tariffs.</p> 
<p>When a vote to overturn his Canada levies came to the floor Wednesday, “I was in the cloakroom, and I heard people say, 'I hate tariffs,' and then voted” to leave them in place, Bacon recalled. Were it not for threats of retaliation from Trump and a heavy White House lobbying campaign, he estimated “30 or 40” Republicans would have broken ranks.</p> 
<p>In the end, only six did. But thanks to the thin margins in both chambers — especially the House — a few steel-spined lawmakers can have an outsized impact. That’s a change from the dynamics in Trump’s first term, when many House Republicans weren’t fully on board with the president’s MAGA agenda, but the GOP had a much larger majority to work with.</p> 
<p>Just ask Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has gone from an occasional annoyance to Republican leaders to a persistent problem in the 119th Congress.</p> 
<p>“The margin is razor-thin, so on any given day, I would just need one or two of my own co-conspirators to get something done,” Massie said in an interview before predicting the situation will only get worse for Trump.</p> 
<p>“The retirement caucus is growing,” he said, referring to the dozens of members <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/nevada-republican-mark-amodei-retiring-00769192" target="_blank">not seeking reelection to the House</a>. “Once we get past March, April, and May, which contain a large portion of their Republican primaries, I think you're going to see more defections.”</p> 
<p>Those who have not defected are losing patience with their colleagues, with many arguing it is only hurting the GOP’s chances in the upcoming midterms.</p> 
<p>“Certainly, I respect their right to be independent,” said Republican Rep. Buddy Carter, who is running for Senate in Georgia. “But you know, this is a team game. We got to remember that.”</p> 
<p>One House Republican who was granted anonymity to speak candidly complained about a faction that “just wants to go rogue” while putting colleagues in a politically difficult spot — such as with the tariff vote this week.</p> 
<p>“Those guys might lose now,” the lawmaker said of the House GOP’s most vulnerable members.</p> 
<p>As voting was underway on the tariff measure this week, Trump publicly threatened to support primary challengers and enact other “consequences” against the members who didn't fall in line. To some degree it worked — predictions of a mass GOP jailbreak didn’t materialize.</p> 
<p>But enough members with some political insulation defected, allowing the measure to advance through the House and onto the Senate, which is likely to approve it and set up a Trump veto. Bacon and Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington are retiring, freeing them from concerns about primary threats.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Jeff Hurd of Colorado are in competitive districts that Republicans can’t afford to lose, putting pressure on the duo to show independence from their party. Rep. Kevin Kiley’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/kevin-kiley-shutdown-gop-critic-00608517" target="_blank">California district got blown up</a> as part of Trump’s redistricting war. And Massie has long been accustomed to being at odds with party leaders, with his campaign to pry open the Jeffrey Epstein files sparking open warfare with the White House.</p> 
<p>Some have doubts that a larger group of Republicans will ever break dramatically with Trump, given his durable popularity with the party base and the need for GOP candidates even in purple districts to appeal to the president’s loyalists.</p> 
<p>One test will come later this year when Trump hits the midterm campaign trail, said Sam Geduldig, a lobbyist at CGCN Group and former House leadership aide.</p> 
<p>“I would be surprised if a candidate didn’t want him at a rally, and that speaks to Trump’s strength,” he said. “If he can do that, it says a lot. In 2006, no one wanted [former President] George W. Bush in their district — not in conservative districts, not in moderate ones. If you’re measuring him against modern Republican presidents, he looks strong by comparison.”</p> 
<p>Over in the Senate, Trump already has a fraught relationship with some GOP senators, like Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, and there is generally a stronger culture of lawmaker independence. But Trump’s decision to essentially send Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina into retirement has introduced a new wild card in the chamber’s dynamics.</p> 
<p>Tillis announced he would not seek reelection after voting to oppose Trump’s signature “big, beautiful bill” and warning the Medicaid cuts in the party-line policy package would be a political death knell for the GOP. Now Tillis is frequently speaking out against Trump and is single-handedly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/30/kevin-warsh-thom-tillis-federal-reserve-confirmation-00756958" target="_blank">blocking his Federal Reserve nominees</a> until a Justice Department investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is resolved.</p> 
<p>Some members are also eyeing GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana as a freer agent after Trump went ahead and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/20/letlow-senate-cassidy-trump-00736200" target="_blank">endorsed an opponent</a> in the May 16 primary. Asked about Trump’s threats to lawmakers, Tillis suggested they could easily backfire.</p> 
<p>“I still maintain a good relationship with him ... but I think we need to check our passions at the door," he said this week.</p> 
<p>Hurd, the Colorado moderate who voted to cancel the Canada tariffs and is facing a more conservative primary challenger, said he would “let the president’s statement speak for itself.”</p> 
<p>But Hurd prevailed in 2024 without Trump’s endorsement and is in a competitive enough district that Trump can’t afford to meddle too much. The district was decided by 546 votes in 2022, when GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert narrowly held onto the seat.</p> 
<p>“If they want to come to a district where Trump is underwater and push for tariffs in an agriculture- and manufacturing-heavy area, fine — that’s not going to work,” said a person granted anonymity to candidly discuss party strategy. “If they want to lose the majority and play in these primaries, then go ahead.”</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, has his hands full just keeping his majority intact. He currently can afford to lose only a single GOP member on party-line votes, and while upcoming special elections could boost that margin slightly, things are likely to remain super tight.</p> 
<p>Johnson this week said he had urged one <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/neal-dunn-resignation-johnson-00776216" target="_blank">Republican battling health issues</a>, Rep. Neal Dunn of Florida, to stick it out and finish his term amid concerns he might resign early.</p> 
<p>Dunn declined to comment on his plans, but a close friend of his, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), said he had jokingly told Dunn he would like to be helpful amid all the floor unrest.</p> 
<p>"I did offer to carry him into the chamber,” Wilson said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawmakers left Washington for a week-long recess Thursday, showing no urgency to avert a shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security that will take effect Saturday morning.</p> 
<p>The overwhelming sense of resignation reflected the reality that neither Republicans nor Democrats saw an obvious path forward to resolving their differences over President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and whether to rein it in as part of <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7147" target="_blank">legislation to fund DHS.</a></p> 
<p>Though negotiations between the White House and Senate Democrats continue, the trajectory of talks suggest DHS funding will be lapsed for at least 10 days — meaning the soonest any resolution would be reached is in the political hothouse around Trump’s State of the Union address on Feb. 24. The lack of progress has even raised the prospect that Trump’s speech to Congress might be postponed, and some Democrats are mulling a boycott.</p> 
<p><b>“</b>This ‘nyah nyah’ is going to go on for a while,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Thursday.</p> 
<p>Even if a deal were struck, Kennedy added, “I’m not entirely convinced that anybody would vote for it. I can’t see the Dems voting for anything because they’re not going to get pounded for funding ICE. And the Republicans on my side are not going to get pounded for hurting ICE.”</p> 
<p>Negotiations between Democrats and White House officials were ongoing as of Thursday evening. Democrats, who have floated a series of guardrails on immigration enforcement agencies in exchange for funding DHS, were expected to formally respond to the latest White House offer over the weekend after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries bashed it Thursday without disclosing specifics on what was contained within.</p> 
<p>The absence of leaked bill text in the exchanges between Democrats and the White House was one subtle sign of encouragement for those watching the negotiations that both sides were taking the talks seriously.</p> 
<p>As they prepared to leave Washington, Republicans continued to knock key demands from Democrats, including a proposal that immigration enforcement agents seek judicial warrants before entering private property.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans and Democrats were “not close.” A senior White House official granted anonymity during a call with reporters warned that the administration wouldn’t “accept concessions that meaningfully affect its ability to carry out its immigration enforcement agenda.”</p> 
<p>Even if a compromise emerges, some Democrats worry that Republicans will insist on so many qualifications that any of their proposed guardrails would be rendered toothless.</p> 
<p>“We can't pass reform that has exceptions and caveats — ‘you can't wear masks, except for seven different situations where you can. You can't bust into people's homes, except 20 different situations where you can,’” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the subcommittee overseeing DHS appropriations. “The offers we've gotten are just not serious.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said it was paramount that both sides “sit down with each other face to face and talk about what you’re doing.” But there were no plans for an in-person meeting<b>.</b></p> 
<p>It will likely take weeks for the public to start feeling pain from a lapse in DHS funding, meaning each side will feel limited political pressure to give in right away. TSA screeners are not set to miss paychecks until March, and FEMA coffers are likely full enough to respond to natural disasters for the near future.</p> 
<p>After the Senate failed to pass DHS funding legislation Thursday, lawmakers in both chambers left Washington with guidance to be ready to come back in a matter of days if Democrats and the White House were able to strike a deal – something that members didn’t see as a realistic possibility before the end of next week.</p> 
<p>“Both sides could dig in and just let this thing drag on,” Thune said. “I don’t think that’s in anybody’s best interest.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bipartisan congressional pressure helped push Mexico’s legislature to approve a joint military exercise between the U.S. and Mexican militaries, according to two people familiar with a U.S. delegation to the country.</p> 
<p>The U.S. and Mexico had been considering a joint exercise for which 19 U.S. Marines would train with the Mexican Navy in the city of Campeche along the Gulf of Mexico (the U.S. calls it the “Gulf of America”). But Mexican lawmakers balked at approving the exercise after the U.S. conducted a Jan. 3 operation to capture former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.</p> 
<p>The plan got back on track following a visit from a congressional delegation led by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51507" data-person-id="51507">Michael McCaul</a> (R-Texas), according to two people familiar with the visit who were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. U.S. lawmakers raised the issue with their counterparts in the Mexican Senate, urging them to approve the exercise and telling Mexican lawmakers they would closely track the matter, the people said.</p> 
<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum <a href="https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2026/02/11/sheinbaum-solicita-al-senado-el-ingreso-de-19-navy-seals-estadounidenses-para-adiestramiento-en-mexico/" target="_blank">officially requested the Marines’ entry earlier this week</a> for the exercises, which will run from Feb. 15 to April 16. The nudge from Congress apparently helped, and Mexico’s Senate unanimously approved the Marines’ entry on Wednesday.</p> 
<p>The involvement of the congressional delegation in securing the approval of the exercise has not been previously reported.</p> 
<p>McCaul, who chairs the Mexico-United States Interparliamentary Group, and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51338" data-person-id="51338">Henry Cuellar</a> of Texas, the top Democrat for the group, said in a joint statement that they “welcome the approval” and said it was a “key objective of our bipartisan delegation to Mexico this past weekend.”</p> 
<p>“We are grateful for the Mexican Senate’s commitment to shared security, which will enable our countries to enhance intelligence-sharing and naval capabilities, intercept dangerous shipments before they reach our shores, and better protect communities on both sides of the border,” McCaul and Cuellar said.</p> 
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said in his own statement that the delegation “in its meetings with Mexican authorities and Senate counterparts, reflects the profound depth of our bilateral cooperation.” He added it was also part of the embassy’s round-the-clock efforts “to work alongside the Government of Mexico and deliver greater security and prosperity for the American and Mexican peoples.”</p> 
<p>At least in this case, the episode underscores that lawmakers still have some ability to sway foreign policy.</p> 
<p>And the approval of the exercise comes at a critical juncture for the bilateral security relationship between Mexico City and Washington. President Donald Trump has previously warned he might consider using military force against Mexico’s drug cartels in the name of combating fentanyl trafficking.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, drug cartels, which control an increasing amount of territory in Mexico, have continued to expand their technological capabilities. On Wednesday, the U.S. abruptly closed the airspace around El Paso International Airport, saying that a Mexican cartel’s drone had breached U.S. airspace and counter-drone operations around the airport could have endangered commercial flights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawmakers are heading for the exits following a failed Senate vote Thursday, all but guaranteeing the Department of Homeland Security shuts down early Saturday morning.</p> 
<p>The funding lapse, which will <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/dhs-shutdown-impact-furloughs-00775499" target="_blank">hit parts of DHS harder than others</a>, comes as the White House and congressional Democrats have failed to move closer to a deal after trading proposals to rein in immigration enforcement practices in the wake of two high-profile shootings in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>Democrats called the latest offer from the White House insufficient Thursday and are expected to send a counteroffer.</p> 
<p>“Democrats have been very clear: We will not support an extension of the status quo,” Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.</p> 
<p>Democrats went on to block progress on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_7147" target="_blank">DHS funding bill</a> the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/22/house-approves-homeland-security-funding-amid-ice-uproar-00742402" target="_blank">House passed last month</a>, which would have been the vehicle for a short-term funding punt or a larger immigration agreement. The procedural vote was 52-47, well short of the needed 60 votes.</p> 
<p>Prior to the vote, Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, announced that ICE would be ending its enhanced immigration enforcement, a step Democrats have called for. But Schumer said Thursday that “ICE’s abuses cannot be solved merely through executive fiat alone — we first and foremost need legislation.”</p> 
<p>Republicans attempted to pass a two-week-long stopgap for DHS Thursday afternoon. But every senator needed to agree to quick passage, and Democrats blocked it on the Senate floor, saying a durable agreement to rein in the department was necessary.</p> 
<p>While the negotiations have centered on ICE and Customs and Border Protection, a shutdown will affect a wider variety of agencies including TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> told reporters he thought the White House offer went “a long ways” toward an agreement, adding: “There are a couple of issues obviously that they’re going to have to work through and work out [with Democrats], and lines that neither side is probably going to be able to cross.”</p> 
<p>Thune added that Democrats are “posturing right now” but that “progress has been real.”</p> 
<p>With no deal close at hand, the Senate is on track to adjourn Thursday for a previously scheduled one-week recess. The House also adjourned Thursday for its previously scheduled recess, though members are on call to return within 48 hours if an agreement is reached. Thune said Thursday if a deal is struck, senators will need to get back to the Capitol within 24 hours.</p> 
<p>Some GOP senators publicly pushed to stay in session in the event of a DHS shutdown, but many others pleaded with their colleagues during a closed-door lunch earlier this week to let them go back home and campaign.</p> 
<p>Others are scheduled to leave Thursday to go on international trips, including a bipartisan group heading to the Munich Security Conference. House Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> has barred members from traveling to Munich or going on other government-funded trips over the break.</p>

      <title>Mike Johnson chides DOJ for tracking lawmakers’ perusal of unredacted Epstein files</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday he disapproves of the Justice Department surveilling lawmakers who come to agency headquarters to review the unredacted Jeffrey Epstein files.</p> 
<p>“I don't think it's appropriate for anybody to be tracking that,” Johnson told reporters. “So I will echo that to anybody involved with DOJ, and I'm sure it was an oversight. That's my guess.”</p> 
<p>This week, members of Congress have been invited to a DOJ office building to read materials related to the federal case against Epstein that have not been scrubbed for public consumption.</p> 
<p>“Members should obviously have the right to peruse those at their own speed and with their own discretion,” Johnson said.</p> 
<p>But revelations came to light Wednesday, when Attorney General Pam Bondi was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, that the department might be keeping tabs on which documents lawmakers are viewing on official computers. During Bondi’s appearance on Capitol Hill, a <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/attorney-general-pam-bondi-takes-her-seat-before-testifying-news-photo/2260529263?adppopup=true" target="_blank"><u>photo was taken of her research binder</u></a> that revealed a print-out page of the “Search History” for Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).</p> 
<p>“It is an outrage that DOJ is tracking Members’ investigative steps undertaken to ensure that DOJ is complying with the Epstein File Transparency Act and using this information for the Attorney General’s embarrassing polemical purposes,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, in a statement.</p> 
<p>Jayapal said <a href="https://x.com/NPRinskeep/status/2021934199020601409" target="_blank"><u>in an interview</u></a> with NPR that she had also raised her concerns with Johnson.</p> 
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, at his weekly news conference Thursday, said he would follow up to ensure Johnson is pressing the matter with the DOJ directly and “make clear to him that his job is to defend this institution.”</p> 
<p>Jeffries continued, “it does violate the principles of separate and co-equal branches of government. And of course, my Republican colleagues should be denouncing it, but they will not, because they simply are reckless rubber stamps for Donald Trump's extreme behavior.”</p> 
<p>It's not clear what will come from the complaints. A Justice Department spokesperson, in a statement, said the agency "has extended Congress the opportunity to review unredacted documents in the Epstein files. As a part of that review, DOJ logs all searches made on its systems to protect against the release of victim information."</p> 
<p>Asked whether Democrats would seek reprisal for the DOJ tracking, Jeffries said “accountability can either happen right now” or “in the aftermath of the November midterm elections,” when the New Yorker is bullish that his party will retake control of the House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Utah Sen. John Curtis will vote against Jeremy Carl's nomination for a top post at the State Department — dealing a crippling blow to the Trump nominee's chances of ascending to the job of assistant secretary of state for International Organizations.</p> 
<p>"After reviewing his record and participating in today’s hearing, I do not believe that Jeremy Carl is the right person to represent our nation’s best interests in international forums, and I find his anti-Israel views and insensitive remarks about the Jewish people unbecoming of the position for which he has been nominated,” Curtis said in a statement Thursday.</p> 
<p>The first-term senator's announcement came after Carl told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a confirmation hearing on Thursday he would not stop making posts and statements as he waits for congressional confirmation.</p> 
<p>Members from both parties on the committee grilled Carl over a string of comments Democrats call antisemitic and racist that have surfaced in recent months.</p> 
<p>“I greatly understand the importance of restraint and conduct,” said Carl, a senior fellow at the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/05/how-the-claremont-institute-became-a-power-center-in-trumps-washington-00700147" target="_blank">Claremont Institute</a>, a conservative think tank with members dispersed throughout Washington. “I unfortunately have to balance that with my current job, which involves advocacy and I can’t, as I’ve explained, just totally put away my day job. I’m not being offered a job here yet.“</p> 
<p>Assuming all Democrats in the Foreign Relations Committee join Curtis in voting to reject his nomination, Carl will not have enough votes to advance to the Senate floor. Carl previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior during Trump's first term.</p> 
<p>In the past, Carl has appeared to endorse the “great replacement theory,” slammed the Juneteenth holiday and called for the execution of American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/politics/kfile-jeremy-carl-state-department-deleted-tweets" target="_blank">according to CNN</a>. He deleted nearly 5,000 social media posts since before his nomination, the outlet reported in September.</p> 
<p>“We are essentially moving,” he told conservative media commentator Tucker Carlson in April 2024, “to what is effectively, a post-White America.”</p> 
<p>Democrats also hit out at Carl, who grew up Jewish before converting to Christianity, for what they say are derisive comments he’s made about Jewish Americans, including statements that diminish the effects of the Holocaust.</p> 
<p>“No person who thinks Jews should get over the Holocaust and spreads pernicious Jewish stereotypes can claim to have the character or judgment necessary to serve as a diplomat for this country,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-floor-remarks-opposing-the-nomination-of-jeremy-carl-following-his-record-of-racist-and-antisemitic-rhetoric" target="_blank">said in a statement this week</a>.</p> 
<p>Democrats on the foreign relations committee, including ranking member Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), a former synagogue president, panned Carl for his past statements.</p> 
<p>A vote for Carl "tells Americans you're willing to use your sacred vote, not just to ignore but to endorse the hateful statements,” Rosen implored her colleagues.</p> 
<p>“It tells Jewish Americans they simply don't matter," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Rep. Billy Long apologized to lawmakers for a private joke he made to former House colleagues saying Iceland would be the “52nd state” with him as its governor.</p> 
<p>Appearing Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President Donald Trump’s pick to serve as ambassador to the Arctic nation moved to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/15/congress/billy-long-apologizes-to-iceland-00732007" target="_blank">clean up a diplomatic mess</a> of his own making.</p> 
<p>“It was totally inappropriate,” Long told senators, describing the remark as an attempt at humor that did not land well. “I just hope that the people in Iceland will give me a second chance to make a first impression.”</p> 
<p>Long’s private joke on the House floor, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2026/01/14/more-floor-meltdowns-threaten-funding-bills-00727023" target="_blank">first reported by POLITICO</a>, prompted minor diplomatic issues amid tense relations between the U.S. and Iceland as Trump seeks to take control of nearby Greenland, a Danish territory. Icelanders also <a href="https://island.is/undirskriftalistar/915fdb39-dad8-4b98-86a1-da6db479775c" target="_blank">launched a petition</a> to their foreign minister, Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, to reject Long as ambassador.</p> 
<p>“We want [Gunnarsdóttir] to reject Billy Long as ambassador to Iceland and call for the United States to nominate another man, who will show Iceland and Icelanders more respect,” the petition read, garnering thousands of signatures.</p> 
<p>Long later apologized for the remark, telling Alaska-based news site <a href="https://www.arctictoday.com/trumps-iceland-ambassador-pick-apologizes-for-52nd-state-comment/" target="_blank">Arctic Today</a> that he was aware of the reaction in Iceland.</p> 
<p>“There was nothing serious about that, I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland and they started joking about me and if anyone took offense to it, then I apologize,” Long said.</p> 
<p>The president has also mused about making Canada the 51st state.</p> 
<p>Trump nominated Long to replace former Ambassador Carrin Patman. Long represented Missouri’s 7th Congressional District for six terms and briefly served as IRS commissioner last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told senators Thursday that federal law enforcement agencies are still blocking state and local authorities from participating in the investigations into the shootings of two U.S. citizens by immigration agents in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p>“We haven’t had any cooperation up until now, which is very unusual, because in prior cases where there’s been a federal and state interest in a crime, we’ve seen collaboration between federal and state authorities,” Ellison told lawmakers on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. </p> 
<p>Federal agents shot and killed two Americans — Renee Good and Alex Pretti — just days apart amid public protests over a major expansion of federal immigration enforcement in Minneapolis in December and January.</p> 
<p>Ellison said that in the case of the shooting of 37-year-old Good in early January, state officials still haven’t had any access to the car she was driving when ICE officers shot and killed her, or the bullet casings.</p> 
<p>Ellison said federal officials are not investigating the shootings and added: “We still haven’t received any access to the evidence that is involved in that case. ... But we’re with good faith hoping that things will change.”</p> 
<p>The FBI declined to comment. The Justice and Homeland Security Departments did not respond to requests for comment.</p> 
<p>Ellison’s comments Thursday follow <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/11/minneapolis-republicans-democrats-dig-in-heels-00721471" target="_blank">earlier protests from Minnesota officials</a> that they were not being included in the federal investigations that followed the Good shooting. In the immediate aftermath of the killing, prosecutors had begun investigating Good’s widow as opposed to the officers, though that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2026/01/13/at-least-6-minnesota-doj-prosecutors-resign-after-request-for-probe-into-renee-goods-widow/" target="_blank">probe appears to have stopped</a> after federal prosecutors resigned in protest.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, White House border czar Tom Homan said Thursday that the surge of thousands of immigration officers into Minneapolis will soon come to an end.</p> 
<p>Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee said federal investigators need to be more transparent.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151824" data-person-id="151824">Richard Blumenthal</a> (D-Conn.) said he was “really concerned that the failure to provide this evidence” and collaborate with local law enforcement “in fact, amounts to a cover up.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sen. Jacky Rosen will introduce a resolution Thursday designed to put the Senate on record opposing the prospect of President Donald Trump granting a pardon or clemency to Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who is currently in prison.</p> 
<p>The Nevada Democrat, in a statement first shared with POLITICO, said she wanted to “make sure the U.S. Senate sends a clear message to the White House that a convicted sex trafficker of minors should not receive any clemency.”</p> 
<p>“If Leader Thune won’t bring this up for a recorded vote, I'll do everything I can to try to bring this up for unanimous consent, as it’s my sincere hope we can all agree Ghislaine Maxwell should serve out her full sentence,” Rosen added.</p> 
<p>Absent getting Republicans to allow a vote on her resolution, Rosen is discussing whether to try to approve it through a unanimous consent agreement after the Senate returns from next week’s scheduled recess.</p> 
<p>Adoption would require an agreement from all 100 senators, however. And while there are Republicans who have clamored for more transparency in the Epstein case and accountability for Epstein’s co-conspirators, the measure would likely face at least one GOP objection. Though the Senate quickly cleared legislation last year to force the release of the Epstein files, Senate Republicans have batted down related follow-up efforts on the floor.</p> 
<p>Though the resolution would be nonbinding, it would make the Senate’s official position against a pardon or clemency for Maxwell, which Republicans could see as boxing in Trump if he chooses that route.</p> 
<p>The president has not ruled it out, and Rosen’s forthcoming resolution is expected to note that the president has refused to rule it out. It also is likely to quote Trump saying, in 2025, he is “allowed to do it, but it’s something [he has] not thought about.”</p> 
<p>Maxwell’s attorneys have said his client will only testify under oath in exchange for clemency. Making good on that position, Maxwell invoked her Fifth Amendment right earlier this month when she appeared over video in a deposition, in compliance with a congressional subpoena, before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Justice Democrats and the Peace, Accountability, and Leadership PAC, or PAL PAC, have jointly endorsed progressive influencer Kat Abughazaleh in the hotly contested Democratic primary to replace Rep. Jan Schakowsky in Illinois.</p> 
<p>In a statement, Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas described Abughazaleh as “the type of progressive leadership we need in Congress — leadership that isn't too afraid to take on AIPAC or corporate PACs to defeat right-wing fascism or corporate corruption in the Democratic Party.”</p> 
<p>Abughazaleh faces more than a dozen opponents in a March primary that’s turned into a national proxy fight. Last week, a newly formed super PAC, Elect Chicago Women, started airing ads backing state Sen. Laura Fine, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/centrist-democrats-are-livid-with-aipac-after-primary-meddling-00769461?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack" target="_blank">some of Fine’s opponents have accused</a> the PAC of being funded by AIPAC.</p> 
<p>Abughazaleh, who is Palestinian American, has frequently criticized AIPAC and <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1967945971914117481" target="_blank">called Israel’s military operations in Gaza a genocide</a>.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two dozen House members could miss a major national security gathering in Munich this weekend, thanks to the Senate's struggles to strike a deal that would avert a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security.</p> 
<p>With DHS funding past Friday in doubt, Speaker Mike Johnson told members this week they will not be allowed to travel with official funding during the upcoming recess. That includes military flights, which are frequently arranged for congressional delegations overseas.</p> 
<p>House members could arrange commercial flights, but it's unclear whether they could seek House reimbursement for them.</p> 
<p>Among the trips in doubt is the Munich Security Conference, which some members were hoping to depart for Thursday, according to four people granted anonymity to describe private discussions. The Senate is not affected by Johnson's prohibition and multiple senators have indicated they plan to attend the conference regardless of whether DHS is funded or not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans for Prosperity Action, the political arm of the powerful conservative Koch network, has placed a 7-figure ad buy for former RNC Chair Michael Whatley’s Senate campaign in North Carolina, banking an early investment in a must-win seat for the GOP in what's expected to be one of the most expensive races in the country.</p> 
<p>The total spend in the Tarheel State will amount to over $1 million and will run on cable, marking the organization’s first TV ad buy of the 2026 midterms cycle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9dS0IlGjHE" target="_blank">The 30-second spot</a>, shared first with POLITICO, hits on perennial Koch priorities, casting Whatley as the candidate who will “stop wasteful spending, drive down prices and cut taxes.” The package of ads will also run on internet connected TV services and Meta platforms.</p> 
<p>Sen. Thom Tillis’ (R-N.C.) retirement announcement last year <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/29/thom-tillis-retires-00432045" target="_blank">following a barrage of attacks from President Donald Trump</a> opened a top-priority race for both parties in the swing state. Democrats haven’t won a Senate race or carried the state at the presidential level since 2008 — but Democrats have been inching closer to cinching a statewide federal win in past cycles after posting two consecutive Democrats to the governor’s mansion and maintaining a longtime hold on the attorney general’s office in Raleigh.</p> 
<p>Whatley, the Trump-endorsed front-runner in the GOP primary, raised <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/01/senate-fundraising-campaign-finance-fec-00759078" target="_blank">$3.8 million in 2025’s final FEC filing period</a>, which amounted to about half of the $7 million haul posted by former Gov. Roy Cooper, his likely Democratic challenger. AFP Action’s support will likely amount to just a drop in the bucket, though, as operatives in both parties have estimated that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/roy-cooper-raises-14-5-million-last-quarter-shattering-records-00594563" target="_blank">spending in the race could reach $650 million</a> by Election Day.</p> 
<p>The ad campaign is coupled with a grassroots door-knocking effort helmed by AFP Action, which began in North Carolina earlier this year. Whatley is set to join one of those outreach efforts himself in the Charlotte area later this month.</p> 
<p>The significant spend in North Carolina comes as the group has made similar, albeit smaller, 6-figure digital investments in the open Senate races in Michigan and New Hampshire for Mike Rogers and John Sununu, respectively — a sign of where they might invest more down the line.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A DHS shutdown is coming Friday night, and there’s no telling how long it could last.</p> 
<p>The White House on Wednesday night sent Congress the legislative text of its immigration enforcement counterproposal, a White House official and two people granted anonymity to disclose the private action told POLITICO. But key Democrats have already said they don’t believe the administration is serious enough about reining in the immigration agencies, all but guaranteeing a funding lapse despite the text exchange.</p> 
<p><b>— State of play: </b>Senators are headed into doomed DHS appropriations votes Thursday. Majority Leader John Thune teed up a vote to advance the House-passed DHS bill. Once that inevitably fails, Republicans plan to try to pass at least one continuing resolution, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss unannounced plans.</p> 
<p>“It doesn’t look like we’re going to stick the landing … so we’ll have to go to Plan B,” Thune told reporters Wednesday evening.</p> 
<p>Republicans want another stopgap that lasts between four to six weeks, but haven’t made a final decision about what they will try to clear Thursday. But they’d need Senate Democrats to advance any such measure, and the minority party said Wednesday they had no interest in cooperating on a stopgap.</p> 
<p>Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared Democrats won’t support a CR after refusing to rule one out throughout the week. Other Democrats whose votes would likely be necessary — Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada — told POLITICO Wednesday they won’t back a funding patch either.</p> 
<p>“ICE is shutting down until we put guardrails,” Rosen said. “ICE should be acting with the same rules, uniform code of conduct, like the FBI and our state and local police … We are just asking what every other law enforcement agency abides by.”</p> 
<p>ICE is among the DHS agencies that would be least affected by a shutdown. That’s because it receives a combination of mandatory funds, revenue from fees and billions of dollars from the GOP megabill President Donald Trump signed into law in 2025.</p> 
<p><b>— Why a shutdown could drag: </b>Congress is in recess next week, and several senators are eager to get out of town today to make it to the Munich Security Conference or to campaign in their home states — regardless of the state of DHS talks.</p> 
<p>“I’m going to go home and I’m packing for Munich and I’m packing for Alaska,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said. “That’s my plan and I’m sticking to it.”</p> 
<p>Once the shutdown starts, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/dhs-shutdown-impact-furloughs-00775499" target="_blank">it could take weeks</a> for the public to notice, giving lawmakers time before public pressure ramps up to end the standoff.</p> 
<p>TSA screeners, for example, would miss their first full paychecks mid-March, leading to a gradual increase in wait times for travelers during the peak of spring break. FEMA has enough funds — about $7 billion — to buoy the agency for at least a month or two during a shutdown.</p> 
<p>DHS officials could also pay active-duty Coast Guard members for several months using a pot of money from the 2025 megabill, which was replenished after last year’s shutdown ended. The Secret Service also received money from the legislation that it could tap in the event of a shutdown.</p> 
<p>“It does take the public a longer time to figure it out,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told POLITICO Wednesday. “[But] I don’t know that the length of this, if there is a shutdown, is going to be based on how long it takes people to feel the effect. I think it’s more going to be governed by when we can find the reforms that are sufficient to people’s concerns.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Rosen’s Epstein resolution: </b>Rosen is introducing a resolution Thursday that would force senators to go on the record over whether President Donald Trump should grant clemency to Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime associate.</p> 
<p>If the resolution passes, it would be nonbinding but symbolically significant in declaring the Senate’s official position against a pardon or clemency for Maxwell, even as her attorney has dangled such a step in exchange for her testimony.</p> 
<p><b>— Notable hearings: </b>It’s the Senate Homeland Security panel's turn to hear testimony from DHS officials, including Todd Lyons, acting director for ICE, at 9 a.m. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hear testimony from Defense Department officials on American drones at 9:30 a.m. And at 10 a.m., the crypto world will tune into <a href="https://www.politico.com/morningmoney" target="_blank">SEC Chair Paul Atkins’ testimony</a> in front of the Senate Banking Committee as the industry pushes for a revamp of financial regulations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A small GOP rebellion is unleashing a flood of House votes on President Donald Trump’s tariff policies in the coming weeks — handing Democrats a powerful tool to hammer Republicans on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/affordability-affordability-affordability-democrats-new-winning-formula-00637023" target="_blank">affordability issues</a> ahead of the November midterms.</p> 
<p>House leaders had shielded their most vulnerable Republicans from politically explosive <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HJRES_72" target="_blank">votes on tariffs</a> for more than a year, but now the fallout is reverberating on Capitol Hill and in tough battleground races around the country.</p> 
<p>Six Republicans broke ranks and joined Democrats on Wednesday to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/house-rebukes-trumps-canada-tariffs-00776898" target="_blank">overturn Trump’s Canada tariffs</a> — a vote that took place only after three of those GOP members bucked Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> and voted Tuesday to reject a provision that would have blocked it. The move is likely to force a Trump veto.</p> 
<p>More votes are coming: Senior House Democrats plan to call up at least three more resolutions that will force many Republicans to choose between protecting their tariff-hit districts and pleasing their MAGA voter bases — not to mention their loyalties to a president who has, up until this week, not tolerated any House GOP dissent on the matter.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198811" data-person-id="198811">Suzan DelBene</a> of Washington, who leads the House Democratic campaign arm, said in an interview that her group would “continue to hold every single vulnerable Republican responsible for their broken promise to lower prices.”</p> 
<p>“If Republicans think this is such a great idea, then they can vote to support the tariffs,” she added. “But … we're going to make sure that they're accountable for their votes.”</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HJRES_72" target="_blank">tariff votes</a> — brought to the House floor under special expedited procedures that Johnson and other GOP leaders cannot easily block — are already making some farm-state Republicans squirm. Trump’s tariff wars have weighed heavily on agricultural exports, and many committed free-traders have long since had to make their peace with Trump’s policies.</p> 
<p>“I've been critical of the tariffs,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/495840" data-person-id="495840">Derek Schmidt</a> (R-Kan.). “But having said that, we've come this far.” He echoed a leadership argument — that Trump’s sweeping tariff powers could be confirmed or curtailed in a Supreme Court ruling expected sometime before July.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51185" data-person-id="51185">Adrian Smith</a> (R-Neb.), another tariff skeptic who chairs the Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, painted the Democratic effort to reject the tariffs as a political stunt. Like Schmidt, he voted to support the Canada tariffs Wednesday.</p> 
<p>“I welcome a sincere discussion on trade policy and the role in the legislative branch — any time, any place,” Smith said. “I'm not sensing that this is one that is intended to be a good discussion.”</p> 
<p>But those in more vulnerable districts and seeking other offices weren’t so eager to chat about the tough vote. Many have been uneasy with the president’s slash-and-burn trade policy and skeptical of the White House’s pleas for patience as Trump pursues trade deals. A recent POLITICO poll showed that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/poll-affordability-cost-of-living-00678076?nid=00000150-1596-d4ac-a1d4-179e288b0000&amp;nname=illinois-playbook&amp;nrid=a2f62cc8-609d-4f42-8611-136f942576cf" target="_blank">more Americans oppose Trump’s tariffs</a> than support them.</p> 
<p>One of the six Republicans opposing the Canada tariffs Wednesday, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/476519" data-person-id="476519">Jeff Hurd</a> of Colorado, cited congressional powers, not political concerns, in explaining his vote, while also noting the steep impact tariffs have had on farmers and manufacturers in his district.</p> 
<p>“My job is to defend my district and my Constitution at the same time,” he said in an interview. “This is not a partisan issue for me.”</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151736" data-person-id="151736">David Schweikert</a>, a longtime free-trade advocate who is running for governor of Arizona in a heavily contested GOP primary, said he was on the fence ahead of the Canada vote but ultimately came to a different conclusion.</p> 
<p>“Part of my angst is, it's a taxing authority. Taxing authority belongs with Congress. So in some ways, it's a classic, you know, do I defend the Constitution?”</p> 
<p>Democrats are now preparing to move ahead with multiple additional resolutions overturning Trump’s tariffs in Mexico and Brazil, as well as the president’s global “Liberation Day” tariffs. They see them as up-or-down referendums on a key policy driving up costs for Americans as recent special and off-year elections show voters turning against the GOP.</p> 
<p>“Those folks are starting to speak out,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51521" data-person-id="51521">Gregory Meeks</a> of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the lead proponent of the tariff votes. “Those are warning signs to them that they need to do what the right thing is, and not just follow the president and his wayward ways.”</p> 
<p>Tariff politics are already making their mark on a number of campaigns — especially in districts and states where manufacturing or agriculture have been adversely impacted. Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307607" data-person-id="307607">Haley Stevens</a>, who is running in a competitive Democratic primary for a Michigan Senate seat, has hammered the Trump levies as part of her affordability message.</p> 
<p>“Erratic, shoot-by-the-hip tariffs are causing Michiganders an incredible cost. They're raising the cost of groceries and everyday goods,” Stevens told reporters after a United Auto Workers candidate forum held Wednesday in Washington. “We can't withstand this level of uncertainty and chaos.”</p> 
<p>The tariff votes were unlocked by a trio of House Republicans who are unusually immune to intraparty pressure. One, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198835" data-person-id="198835">Thomas Massie</a> of Kentucky, is a libertarian rebel who has clashed with Trump for months. Another, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260571" data-person-id="260571">Kevin Kiley</a> of California, had his district redrawn by Democrats last year and is less eager to toe the party line.</p> 
<p>The third, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227109" data-person-id="227109">Don Bacon</a> (R-Neb.), is retiring after repeated disagreements with the White House on tariffs, foreign policy and other matters. He said in an interview Wednesday the levies have simply been bad for his Omaha-centered district and that it was time to take a stand.</p> 
<p>“There's so many companies struggling against tariffs, and that's what the president needs to hear,” he said. “Our farmers are struggling.”</p> 
<p>White House officials and House GOP leaders unleashed an all-out pressure campaign to try to force the rebels to fall in line, calling around to other House Republicans and staffers asking “what buttons to push” with the holdouts, according to three people granted anonymity to describe the covert effort.</p> 
<p>Bacon said that after he voted against the procedural measure and left the floor Tuesday night, GOP leaders tried to persuade him to come back and negotiate, offering tariff carve-outs and other incentives for businesses in his district.</p> 
<p>“They were shocked,” Bacon recounted. “They said, ‘Why don't you stick around?’ I said, ‘I'm not planning on negotiating.’”</p> 
<p>After the tariff votes were unleashed, the Trump administration pivoted its lobbying campaign, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/white-house-substantial-gop-defections-canada-tariff-00776381" target="_blank">according to one White House official</a>, and is now focused on maintaining enough GOP support to prevent veto overrides. More than 70 Republicans would have to break ranks to meet the two-thirds majority for an override.</p> 
<p>Some Democrats expected a major GOP jailbreak Wednesday, thinking Republicans would not want to threaten their reelection chances by voting to sustain the tariffs.</p> 
<p>“[Republicans] have been remarkably loyal to a bad policy,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51324" data-person-id="51324">Emanuel Cleaver</a> (D-Mo.). “They were thinking about the president as this term began and as this push on tariffs was launched. And now they’re thinking about themselves.”</p> 
<p>But as House members were voting Wednesday, Trump publicly threatened any turncoats.</p> 
<p>“Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116054542648712986" target="_blank">wrote on Truth Social</a>.</p> 
<p>When the gavel fell, only Hurd and two other Republicans — Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> of Pennsylvania and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227706" data-person-id="227706">Dan Newhouse</a> of Washington — had joined Bacon, Kiley and Massie. The tight margin all but guaranteed that the House will fail to override a Trump veto.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats walked into the House Judiciary Committee hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi Wednesday expecting her to be nonresponsive and combative. They walked out with what they believe to be a more compelling argument for winning back the majority.</p> 
<p>For four hours, the nation’s top law enforcement officer largely refused to answer questions from Democrats about the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p> 
<p>In some moments, Bondi deflected queries by asking members if they cared about crimes or violence in their districts, flipping through a massive binder of research Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) derided as her “burn book.”</p> 
<p>In others, she responded by lashing out at committee members in personal terms, at one point calling Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the panel’s top Democrat, a “washed-up, loser lawyer — not even a lawyer.”</p> 
<p>“If we had the power, we would subpoena her, and we would require her to answer our questions,” Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, told reporters following the hearing. “So that is the importance of who's going to be in control in Congress after the 2026 elections because we would like the subpoena power, so we don't see this kind of phenomenal disrespect of Congress.”</p> 
<p>Even if Democrats reclaim the gavel of the House Judiciary Committee, Bondi could still drag her feet. And her aggressive posture in attacking lawmakers during a regular oversight hearing of the DOJ — the purported purpose of Wednesday’s proceedings — suggests she will not cooperate easily.</p> 
<p>“The questions I’ve asked … are not trick questions, they’re not gotcha questions, they’re actually basic questions about how the Department of Justice functions,” said Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), who said the hearing lacked “some modicum of resembling something that has typically been fairly conventional: an oversight hearing of the Department of Justice.”</p> 
<p>The only relevant, new information that Bondi provided to lawmakers was in response to a question from a Republican, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who asked <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/doj-epstein-investigations-00776455" target="_blank">whether people would be indicted</a> for ties to Epstein’s crimes.</p> 
<p>Bondi said vaguely, “We have pending investigations in our office.” It was not clear whether she was referring to investigations into prominent Democratic officials, which had come after a directive from President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>Still, Democrats think Bondi’s hostile performance throughout the hearing will help their cause in the midterms as they make a case for a return to normalcy. At times, even House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan had to interrupt to ensure lawmakers could ask their questions.</p> 
<p>"I can't believe that the Attorney General of the United States of America would appear before hundreds of millions of Americans this way and then have a book of insults that she's ready to lob at members of Congress ... we've got to get back to the America that we had before they dragged us down into the mud like this,” Raskin said following the hearing.</p> 
<p>Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the Judiciary panel, also said the events Wednesday boost Democrats’ case in the midterm elections.</p> 
<p>“She did an excellent job in appealing to Donald Trump, and it was [a] … one person audience: Donald Trump,” said Cohen, adding that the hearing “gave the public some information about what the Justice Department's not doing correctly.”</p> 
<p>In many ways, Bondi played directly into Democrats’ hands, and not only by trash-talking lawmakers whose questions she didn’t want to answer — similar to the maneuver she deployed when <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/07/congress/bondi-goes-after-schiff-00596375" target="_blank">testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee</a> back in October.</p> 
<p>Democrats coordinated with the victims of Epstein’s abuse so that roughly ten could sit in the hearing room behind Bondi. Lawmakers offered her the opportunity to engage with them directly and apologize for the department’s conduct or meet with the victims.</p> 
<p>Bondi, in her opening remarks, said she was “deeply sorry for what any victim … has been through” but otherwise refused to take the bait. At one point, when Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/dems-challenge-bondi-on-epstein-00775809" target="_blank">asked Bondi to apologize to the victims</a> for what the Justice Department has put them through, Bondi declined: “I’m not going to get in the gutter for her theatrics.”</p> 
<p>Democrats also headed into Wednesday’s high-profile hearing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/pam-bondi-house-judiciary-tesitmony-00775441" target="_blank">prepared to draw a contrast</a> between their interest in asking hard questions about events that have captured the public’s attention — namely justice for Epstein’s victims and accountability for any potential accomplices — and Republicans’ more politically accommodating approach.</p> 
<p>Jordan said on Wednesday evening he thought Bondi “handled herself very well” and expected Democrats to be aggressive. At one point, Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) yelled at Bondi to be “quiet” as he fought to be heard, while Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.) called her “one of the worst” attorneys generals “in our history.”</p> 
<p>“I think it went great — I mean, the bottom line is … under the leadership of the Attorney General and the president, crime is down,” Jordan said.</p> 
<p>The only <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/02/11/congress/massie-vs-bondi-00775966" target="_blank">Republican who challenged Bondi</a> was Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who led the charge to release the Epstein files in DOJ’s possession and picked enough fights with Trump that the president and his allies are now seeking to oust him in a primary.</p> 
<p>Accusing Bondi of failing to comply with the law he shepherded through Congress with sloppy redactions — or lack thereof — of both victims and the name of one powerful man in the Epstein files, Bondi called Massie a “failed politician” and a “hypocrite.”</p> 
<p>Massie, in an interview Wednesday evening, said it took Bondi “a long time to find my insult card.”</p> 
<p>“I think she was crashing the whole time,” he said. “There was no effort really to answer any of the difficult questions.”</p> 
<p>Asked about being the only Republican to ask a tough question at the hearing, Massie replied, “Nobody wants to get on the bad side of Trump. … That’ll change once we get past our primaries.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>House passes GOP elections overhaul</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House passed a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/house-save-act-vote-filibuster-00768499" target="_blank">major GOP elections overhaul</a> Wednesday after intense pressure from President Donald Trump, tech mogul Elon Musk and hard-right influencers. But the legislation still has no clear path forward in the Senate, where Republicans privately acknowledge there is not enough GOP support to skirt a Democratic filibuster as Trump is demanding.</p> 
<p>The SAVE America Act, an updated version of a bill tightening voter registration standards that the House passed last year, was approved on a 218-213 vote. One Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, voted for it — down from the four who backed the earlier effort.</p> 
<p>Conservative hard-liners wanted the bill attached to a massive government funding package this month, threatening to extend a four-day partial government shutdown until Trump intervened and ordered House Republicans to pass the bill without it.</p> 
<p>The legislation would trigger major changes to how Americans vote, including requiring voters to present proof of citizenship to register, eliminating mail-only registrations, and requiring photo ID in every state for the first time. It would also require states to take new steps to remove noncitizens from existing voter rolls.</p> 
<p>The GOP’s hope is that the focus on election integrity and Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was “rigged” will help drive turnout among MAGA voters when Trump isn’t on the ballot this November, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy. The vote is also meant to satisfy the president’s demands for a voting crackdown as he mulls bigger overhauls many Republicans oppose, like “federalizing” America’s election system and ending mail voting.</p> 
<p>But the House vote hands a hot potato to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has ruled out changing Senate rules to weaken the 60-voter supermajority threshold to pass the bill and has reacted coolly to suggestions a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/senate-filibuster-gop-save-act-00775393" target="_blank">“talking filibuster” approach could work instead</a>.</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders deployed a procedural feint, using a Senate-passed shell bill to try to fast-track consideration in the other chamber — part of the Trump-backed push to try to force a reckoning on the filibuster.</p> 
<p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) poured cold water on House Republicans' celebratory mood this week.</p> 
<p>Even before the House vote Wednesday, Murkowski announced she would oppose it — lambasting the bill as “federal overreach.” Her move sparked an onslaught of recriminations from House Republicans, who are still pushing Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson to find a way to send the bill to Trump’s desk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bondi dodges questions about Lutnick’s connections with Epstein</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi gave no direct answer Wednesday when pressed by Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) on whether the Justice Department has made any effort to question Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about his interactions with Jeffrey Epstein.</p> 
<p>“Secretary Lutnick has addressed those ties himself,” Bondi replied.</p> 
<p>Lutnick said on a podcast last year that he was disgusted by Epstein’s conduct and vowed in 2005 to never to be in the same room with him again. However, documents the Justice Department released last month show continued interactions between the two men in the ensuing years.</p> 
<p>In addition, Lutnick acknowledged at a Senate hearing Tuesday that he and his family traveled in 2012 to the Caribbean island Epstein owned. Lutnick <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/lutnick-grilled-over-epstein-links-at-commerce-appropriations-hearing-00773002" target="_blank">described a lunch with the financier</a>, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and who died by suicide in 2019 in a New York jail while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p> 
<p>Lutnick, despite the latest revelations, has faced <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/10/main-wh-lutnick-00774844" target="_blank">few recriminations from Trump world</a> over his connections with the late financier.</p> 
<p>As Balint demanded that Bondi explain whether prosecutors or the FBI have talked with Lutnick or other Trump administration officials who had “ties” with Epstein, the attorney general challenged the lawmaker’s terminology.</p> 
<p>“What does ‘ties’ mean?” Bondi replied. “Can you define that? Can you define ‘ties’?"</p> 
<p>“I think Americans would be shocked to learn that you are not interested in talking with these officials who have ties to Jeffrey Epstein,” Balint replied as the attorney general tried to change the subject to the shooting of a Border Patrol agent in Vermont last month. “We now know that Lutnick went to Epstein's island in 2012. How was that not a dealbreaker for the president?” the Democratic lawmaker asked.</p>]]></content:encoded>
