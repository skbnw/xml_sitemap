      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hopes for a quick patch saving millions of Americans from sharply higher health insurance premiums have given way to expectations of a long slog on Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>It is now all but certain that enhanced Obamacare subsidies first implemented by Democrats as a Covid relief measure will expire Dec. 31 after the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/11/congress/senate-rejects-health-care-bills-00686855" target="_blank">Senate voted down</a> competing partisan health plans Thursday and House GOP leaders indicated they had no plans to bring an extension up for a vote this year.</p> 
<p>Less certain is when lawmakers might begin to pick up the pieces — or if they have any hope of finding a solution. A bipartisan group of lawmakers continues to talk about a possible 11th-hour path forward, hoping that the failed votes this week can give them some badly needed momentum. But most of their colleagues are convinced the discussions won’t bear fruit until 2026.</p> 
<p>A major obstacle is that leaders in both parties are, at least so far, prioritizing plans that don't bridge existing political gaps. Top Republicans are putting forward proposals that would not extend the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, while Democrats are sticking to proposals that most in the GOP say they cannot accept.</p> 
<p>“We don’t have a lot of time,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51218" data-person-id="51218">Lisa Murkowski</a>, an Alaska Republican who voted for both parties’ proposals Thursday. She said she was “talking to people of good will and good faith about how we might be able to sketch” out a compromise.</p> 
<p>But Murkowski also said in a subsequent statement that Congress needs to reach an agreement by Jan. 15 — a concession talks are likely to slip into next year.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/221844" data-person-id="221844">Mike Rounds</a> (R-S.D.), who has been involved in loose bipartisan health care discussions for months, said he hoped the failed votes would lead negotiators to “bridge the impasses.” But asked if there was any way to prevent the subsidies from lapsing, he said, “I honestly don’t know.”</p> 
<p>The stakes for American families are considerable. Independent analysts say those who purchase insurance directly from the ACA exchanges could <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank">see their premiums spike</a> by an average of about $1,000 a year. For some, it could be considerably more. The political stakes are also vast, with many moderate Republicans fretting that a lapse would threaten their reelection campaigns and endanger the GOP’s congressional majorities.</p> 
<p>That sense of panic has not trickled up to Republican leaders, who appear ready to send lawmakers home next week until Jan. 6. By that time, the enhanced subsidies will have lapsed — returning the tax credits to prepandemic levels that assist a much narrower swath of Americans. The Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61734" target="_blank">has estimated millions of Americans</a> will go without insurance as people drop their plans to avoid having to pay higher premiums.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> left the door open Thursday to an 11th-hour deal but also acknowledged the obvious: They don't have a lot of time.</p> 
<p>“We’ll see where the discussions go,” Thune told reporters after the failed votes. “I think we’ll get a sense for that here pretty soon.”</p> 
<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, meanwhile, is plowing forward with a plan to hold a vote next week on a House GOP-authored health care framework that, according to three people granted anonymity to describe internal discussions, will not include a subsidy extension. Instead it is likely to mirror aspects of the Senate proposal that mostly united Republicans Thursday but failed to leapfrog the chamber’s 60-vote legislative threshold.</p> 
<p>Yet to weigh in is President Donald Trump. While he voiced support this week for giving federal money “to people,” not insurance companies, he also has avoided taking a firm stance for or against an extension of the subsidies.</p> 
<p>The White House appears to be tacitly on board with Johnson’s decision not to pursue an extension, with administration officials believing that path unifies the GOP.</p> 
<p>"The idea is to put together a package before Christmas that has unity with 218 Republican votes in the House," said a person familiar with health care discussions on the Hill and in the White House who was granted anonymity to discuss them.</p> 
<p>“The biggest threat these days is the discharge petition," the person said, adding that the only way to avoid it is to "put together a consensus plan" among House Republicans.</p> 
<p>It was a reference to ongoing bipartisan effort to circumvent leadership and force floor votes on legislation that would temporarily extend the expiring Obamacare subsidies while imposing new eligibility requirements. Two such petitions have been filed and received Republican sign-ons in recent days.</p> 
<p>Neither petition has yet to garner the sweeping support from Democrats needed to succeed, however. Instead, Democratic leaders are pushing to discharge a bill that would simply extend the current subsidy framework for three years — to the doorstep of the next presidential election.</p> 
<p>“Every single House Democrat is supportive of a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> told reporters Thursday. “All we need are four Republicans to join us.”</p> 
<p>With nothing likely to make it to Trump’s desk by the end of the year, lawmakers are increasingly turning their attention to January. Many view the Jan. 30 government shutdown deadline as the real cutoff for a bipartisan health care deal.</p> 
<p>Some conservative Republicans are pushing their party to simply pursue a partisan health care bill under the budget reconciliation process, which can skirt the Senate’s 60-vote supermajority requirement. They argue that Democrats are not actually interested in compromising and instead want to run their midterm campaigns on the expired subsidies.</p> 
<p>“I know there are some on my side who say 60-vote bills stand the test of time, yadda yadda yadda,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260075" data-person-id="260075">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.) said. “There are not going to be 60 votes. The Democrats think this is a great political issue for them.”</p> 
<p>But others are talking about paths to compromise, even as bipartisan negotiations have struggled to gain traction over months of attempts before, during and after the 43-day government shutdown where Democrats made extending the subsidies the centerpiece of their demands.</p> 
<p>One idea already floating around the Senate Thursday was to merge the GOP plan, which expands health savings accounts, with an extension of the subsidies accompanied by the kinds of restrictions contemplated in the House bills subject to discharge petitions. Thune said he is being kept in the loop on the bipartisan and bicameral conversations about how to quickly come up with a deal before the holidays.</p> 
<p>Few, however, thought that approach could come together that quickly.</p> 
<p>“It would be great if we could get it done next week, but realistically I think we’ve got to look at it as next week but also January,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151837" data-person-id="151837">John Hoeven</a> (R-N.D.).</p> 
<p>Among Republicans, the pressure posed by the subsidy cliff is rivaled by the anxiety they are feeling about the approaching midterms. GOP lawmakers in both chambers are warning that they are handing Democrats’ a political cudgel to use against them next year if the tax credits expire.</p> 
<p>Democrats will pick “sympathetic cases” to use against Republicans, retiring Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907">Thom Tillis</a> (R-N.C.) predicted, “and there will be plenty of them.” Sen. Jim Justice (R-W.Va.) added that if Republicans are not concerned about the midterm implications, “then you're living in a cave.”</p> 
<p>But Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> warned it might already be too late.</p> 
<p>“The toothpaste is out of the tube,” he said Thursday. “Once Jan. 1 comes and everyone is locked into their insurance proposals, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moderate House Republicans are talking with GOP leaders about possibly setting up an amendment vote that could add an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies to a health care package expected to move across the floor next week, according to four people granted anonymity to describe internal conversations. </p> 
<p>GOP leaders have been skeptical of such a move. But they’re currently working through whether it could pass muster with other Republicans, and it’s under discussion as centrist House Republicans grow desperate to hold off the expiration of the subsidies that more than 20 million Americans use, the four people said. </p> 
<p>Those leadership conversations also include whether to include Texas Rep. August Pfluger’s bill redirecting the tax credits into health savings account contributions as part of the GOP health package next week. </p> 
<p>Other options are under consideration as GOP leaders continue working on a plan Thursday, with Majority Leader Steve Scalise saying in a brief interview he wants to file the bills Friday. </p> 
<p>Two of the GOP moderates, Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, have launched discharge petitions to force an extension vote, but those are unlikely to succeed before the subsidies expire on Dec. 31. </p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick spoke to Johnson about the push during a meeting in his office Thursday, according to another person granted anonymity to describe the meeting. Fitzpatrick and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) also huddled with Johnson on the floor later Thursday. </p> 
<p>But Republican leaders are still working through what have so far been intractable issues over using the subsidies to fund abortion coverage, which risks the ire of at least some GOP hard-liners. There are fears adding it as an amendment could imperil the entire package, with key conservatives on the Rules Committee opposed to an ACA extension able to block its consideration. </p> 
<p>But many more House Republicans — even some conservatives — believe there needs to be some sort of subsidy extension as a bridge. “I think we have to have that,” one conservative granted anonymity to speak candidly about a possible amendment. </p> 
<p>Rep. Ralph Norman (S.C.), one of the hard-liners on the Rules Committee, said he opposes the inclusion of a subsidy extension but would not say if he would move to block it from getting a vote.</p> 
<p>“I don't want the discharge petition where you won't have anything,” he said. “We'll see how it goes.”</p> 
<p>The House wrangling over an Obamacare patch comes after four Republican senators voted Thursday to advance a Democratic proposal for a three-year subsidy extension. There are ongoing bipartisan conversations among rank-and-file senators about how to get a deal across the finish line before they leave for the holidays. </p> 
<p>Senate Majority John Thune has left the door open to taking up a bill if it can get through the House but said in an interview Thursday evening that he was not personally encouraging House Republicans to send over a bill. </p> 
<p>“I’ve talked to the speaker, and I think he’s trying to gauge where his members are and see what the traffic will bear over there,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem offered an uncompromising defense of the administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement before lawmakers on Thursday, as questions swirl about her future in the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>In her opening remarks at the House Homeland Security Committee’s annual threats hearing, Noem argued that the number of people who have left the United States voluntarily since President Donald Trump took office shows that the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement is working.</p> 
<p>“Under President Trump’s leadership, DHS is securing our borders, we’re restoring the rule of law, and we’re protecting the homeland,” Noem said. “We have sent a strong message to criminal illegal aliens that we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will deport you.”</p> 
<p>In the face of criticism from Democrats about alleged misconduct on the part of U.S. immigration officers, Noem also defended the conduct of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, arguing that Democrats were unfairly villainizing immigration officials and contributing to violence against them and their families.</p> 
<p>The hearing, an annual occasion which sees Homeland Security secretaries and FBI and NCTC directors testify before congressional committees about the threats the country faces, came at a particularly precarious moment for Noem. While Trump reiterated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-declares-support-cabinet-official-after-report-he-considering-replacement" target="_blank">confidence in Noem on Wednesday</a>, Trump allies have floated the names of several potential replacements as frustrations have boiled over in recent months with how DHS has spent money intended to boost the government’s deportation efforts and how DHS has managed federal disaster relief money.</p> 
<p>Democrats took advantage of the rare appearance by Noem on Capitol Hill to re-up allegations that Noem gave a $220 million contract to a firm tied to the spouse of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin and argue that immigration enforcement officers have violated the civil rights and due process of unauthorized immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.</p> 
<p>Ranking member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51647" target="_blank" data-person-id="51647">Bennie Thompson</a> (D-Miss.) and other Democrats called on Noem to resign, arguing that her tenure has been marked by incompetence, corruption and other malfeasance.</p> 
<p>Democrats also noted it was only Noem’s second appearance before the House committee and one of the few times a DHS official had testified before the committee, as they slammed DHS for a lack of transparency with Congress. Thompson claimed that it had been very difficult to secure DHS officials as witnesses for hearings.</p> 
<p>“Never in the history of the committee has a secretary of Homeland Security hidden from congressional oversight like you and your department have, Secretary Noem,” Thompson said at the start of the hearing.</p> 
<p>House Homeland Security Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/240947" target="_blank" data-person-id="240947">Andrew Garbarino</a> (R-N.Y.). also asked Noem to commit to providing more DHS officials to testify before the committee, which the secretary agreed to do.</p> 
<p>Noem received most of the questions from Democrats and Republicans at the hearing, which also included fellow witnesses Michael Glasheen, the operations director of the FBI’s national security branch, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent. The two faced more questions once Noem left the hearing early to helm a FEMA-related meeting.</p> 
<p>In a potential sign that Republicans see Noem’s position as relatively secure, GOP lawmakers went soft on Noem, voicing general satisfaction with the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement and homeland security broadly.</p> 
<p>“The border is secure, the flow of drugs is slowing, and violent criminals are being taken off the streets. America is once again a symbol of global strength,” Garbarino said.</p> 
<p>“Please go back to your agencies and thank the men and women that are serving every day and helping to keep this country safe,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/523822" target="_blank" data-person-id="523822">Tony Gonzalez</a> (R-Texas), who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p> 
<p>But Republicans did push Noem to help them conduct oversight of the department’s work. New York lawmakers from both parties asked Noem to explain why DHS decided to cut counterterrorism grants to the Empire State. Trump reversed that decision following advocacy from New York lawmakers.</p> 
<p>Democrats also confronted Noem with videos and specific cases that they claim demonstrate the excesses of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy toward unauthorized immigration.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/431425" target="_blank" data-person-id="431425">Seth Magaziner</a> (D-R.I.) pointed to a case where a Korean-born U.S. Marine who served in the U.S. invasion of Panama was deported to Korea earlier this year over drug possession charges from the 1990s. His staffer had the Marine join the hearing via Zoom and held up the livestream with the Marine over Magaziner’s shoulder while the Rhode Island Democrat questioned Noem.</p> 
<p>“These people are not the worst of the worst,” Magaziner said. “You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys. Go after the terrorists. Do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”</p> 
<p>Noem pledged to review the individual cases brought up by Magaziner and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189588" target="_blank" data-person-id="189588">Lou Correa</a> (D-Calif.), but reiterated the Trump administration’s view that it cannot, and should not, make distinctions between the levels of criminal wrongdoing foreign nationals have committed.</p> 
<p>“It is not my prerogative, my latitude, or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country and in which broad discretion of the secretary used to follow you can issue,” Noem said.</p> 
<p>Democrats scoffed at that idea.</p> 
<p>“You have broad discretion as the secretary,” Magaziner responded. “You can do all kinds of things. You’re choosing not to.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee voted Thursday to return Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51338" data-person-id="51338">Henry Cuellar</a> to his leadership position on a powerful spending panel following his pardon on federal corruption charges.</p> 
<p>“We got ratified,” Cuellar told reporters following the vote.</p> 
<p>The veteran Texas lawmaker overcame <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/henry-cuellar-appropriations-vote-00685842" target="_blank">private concerns inside his party</a> about restoring him as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security subpanel after President Donald Trump granted him clemency in a surprise move last week.</p> 
<p>But Cuellar remains popular in the Democratic Caucus, particularly among longtime colleagues — some of whom argued that with the pardon wiping away his bribery indictment, the legal process had run its course and there was no reason to bar Cuellar from the post under caucus rules.</p> 
<p>“Just look at the rules,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198762" data-person-id="198762">Lois Frankel</a> (D-Fla.). “There’s nothing more to say.”</p> 
<p>Still, the fact that the vote even happened meant that at least one Democratic appropriator privately objected to reappointing Cuellar by acclamation. If his party retakes the House majority next year, Cuellar would be in line as subcommittee chair to directly oversee more than $60 billion in annual spending on agencies including Customs and Border Protection and ICE.</p> 
<p>Democrats have made a high-profile push in recent weeks to police ethical transgressions in the party’s ranks. Nearly two dozen Democrats led by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/429181" data-person-id="429181">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a> of Washington broke ranks to reprimand Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/304652" data-person-id="304652">Chuy García</a> (D-Ill.) for apparently engineering his retirement announcement to ensure a favored ally would succeed him.</p> 
<p>Illinois Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307305" data-person-id="307305">Lauren Underwood</a> has served as the top Democrat on the subpanel since Cuellar’s indictment last year alleging he took some $600,000 in bribes from foreign entities. Cuellar has denied wrongdoing and cast his indictment under President Joe Biden as political retribution for his moderate immigration stances.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> said Thursday he understands the “dilemma” facing House Republicans who have launched or joined discharge petitions that would <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank">force a vote to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies</a>. But he gave no indication he would change his current course of letting the tax credits expire.</p> 
<p>"Leadership’s never in favor of discharges,” Johnson said in a brief interview Thursday. “I understand the dilemma they see themselves in. But, I mean, I don't endorse it."</p> 
<p>GOP leaders are planning to put <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/no-house-gop-health-plan-00684401" target="_blank">several health care bills up for a vote</a> next week before lawmakers leave Washington for the holidays. But they still have no intention of including a subsidy extension, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal GOP plans.</p> 
<p>The two GOP-led petitions — one put forward by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.), another by Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.) — picked up several more Republican signatures Thursday. But neither can trigger a floor vote on an Obamacare subsidy extension this month.</p> 
<p>That’s due both to a waiting period for discharged bills under House rules, as well as the fact that massive support from Democrats will be needed to reach the necessary 218 signatures. Democratic leaders are still deciding whether to support either bill.</p> 
<p>Republican leaders don’t plan to stand in the way if any petition reaches 218 signatures, but they are skeptical that will happen. They face serious challenges in rallying their party around any extension of the subsidies, including the GOP’s long opposition to Obamacare as well as abortion-related divisions within their conference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate rejected dueling health care bills Thursday, all but guaranteeing that Obamacare subsidies used by more than 20 million Americans will lapse at the end of the year.</p> 
<p>Senators voted 51-48 on advancing a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank"><u>GOP health care plan</u></a> that would have expanded health savings accounts as an alternative to the expiring tax credits. <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank"><u>Democrats’ plan</u></a> to extend the Covid-era enhanced subsidies for three years also received a 51-48 vote. Both proposals fell well short of the 60 votes needed to vault a key procedural hurdle.</p> 
<p>The votes both went largely, but not entirely, along party lines. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to oppose the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/cassidy-crapo-unveil-alternative-to-obamacare-subsidies-00682315" target="_blank"><u>GOP plan</u></a>. Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Dan Sullivan of Alaska voted to advance the Democrats’ health care plan. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who would have voted for the GOP plan, missed the votes. </p> 
<p>Paul said his party’s bill, written by Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho, amounted to “Obamacare lite,” while Collins, Hawley and Murkowski have expressed sharp concerns about allowing the subsidies to expire.</p> 
<p>“Unfortunately, the votes that we have just had — neither one kind of gets us there. But there are elements in both that I support,” Murkowski said about her votes to advance both bills. </p> 
<p>Sullivan said he voted to open debate on the Democratic proposal but wanted to make changes to it. Meanwhile, Hawley said that while both parties' proposals would need changes, “I just think we’ve got to do something." </p> 
<p>"So I'm in the all-of-the-above category,” he said.</p> 
<p>Thursday’s Senate votes were part of a deal Senate Majority Leader John Thune made with Democrats to end the government shutdown that ended last month. Senators have widely acknowledged for weeks that the votes were aimed more at messaging than forcing through passable bipartisan compromise.</p> 
<p>Still, a deal in the Senate was likely Congress’ best shot at preventing the subsidies from lapsing and raising premiums for many Americans who buy their insurance directly through Affordable Care Act exchanges. While the lapse will not completely eliminate the tax credits, they will revert back to pre-pandemic levels and <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank"><u>many families could still see their premiums rise</u></a> by $1,000 a year or more.</p> 
<p>“Our bill is the last train leaving the station,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote, urging Republicans to support the Democratic bill.</p> 
<p>The House is similarly riven by partisan divides. Republican leaders have no plans at the moment to put a subsidy extension up for a vote before adjourning for the year next week. Democratic leaders in the chamber, like Senate Democrats, want to extend the expiring tax credits by three years; two bipartisan bills proposing shorter extensions are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank"><u>subject to discharge petitions</u></a> that could force action — but not until next year.</p> 
<p>Thune said if a bill is able to pass the House, “obviously we’ll take a look at it.” But he shared a note of skepticism, saying, “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”</p> 
<p>Rank-and-file senators are leaving the door open to trying to strike a last-minute bipartisan deal, but they are effectively out of time. The Senate is expected to adjourn next week until January, and, while bipartisan talks are ongoing, they’ve failed to gain momentum. </p> 
<p>After Thursday’s failed votes, senators were already floating trying to merge the health savings account flexibility in the GOP bill with an extension of the subsidies with an income cap and other eligibility restrictions. But multiple sticky political fights, including a clash over abortion restrictions, would need to be resolved in a passable deal.</p> 
<p>“I hope that after today they will feel like they’ve checked the messaging box and will get serious about actually doing something about the spiraling health care costs under Obamacare,” Thune said ahead of the vote. “Republicans are ready to get to work. I’m not sure yet if the Democrats are interested.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said she was open to negotiating long-term health care reforms but added that with time running short, extending the credits is the “easiest” immediate solution.</p> 
<p>“We need to act now,” Shaheen said. “I know there are members in both parties who want to find a responsible path forward.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maryland Democrat David Trone, a former three-term House lawmaker who left his seat to launch an ill-fated Senate run in 2024, is making a play for his old job in a primary challenge against first-term Rep. April McClain Delaney, he announced Thursday.</p> 
<p>The battle — in a blue-leaning district Republicans have targeted in the past — could set up an extraordinarily expensive primary between Trone and Delaney, both of whom have multimillion-dollar fortunes.</p> 
<p>Trone hopes his opposition to President Donald Trump will help drive his campaign.</p> 
<p>“Watching Trump and Republicans’ assault on our democracy — weaponizing the government and tearing apart families — is intolerable and goes against everything we stand for,” he said in a statement. “Our fundamental freedoms are being dismantled piece by piece. The people of Maryland’s 6th District need a fighter who will stand up against these attacks every single day.”</p> 
<p>The wealthy wine magnate has self-funded his runs for office before. Trone <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/04/total-wine-trone-maryland-senate-campaign-00095218" target="_blank">spent some $17 million in his successful 2018 House campaign</a>. He then parted ways with more than $60 million in the 2024 Senate primary, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/14/angela-alsobrooks-wins-messy-democratic-senate-primary-in-maryland-00158054" target="_blank">which he lost by more than 10 points to then-Prince George’s County Executive</a> Angela Alsobrooks.</p> 
<p>But McClain Delaney, the wife of former House lawmaker and onetime presidential candidate John Delaney, isn’t ready to go quietly.</p> 
<p>“David Trone thinks I should ‘step aside’ so he can have his old office back after he abandoned the district to run and lose for Senate,” she said in a statement Thursday. “He has the arrogance of a Trump. But not so fast. On behalf of my district, I stand up to bullies.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of House Republicans is trying to bait President Donald Trump into the permitting wars on Capitol Hill, arguing that legislation up for a vote as soon as next week could green-light something he hates with fury: offshore wind power.</p> 
<p>Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) wants the House to pass his bill that would accelerate energy projects of all kinds, which would give him leverage in expected negotiations with the Senate in the coming months on overhauling the federal permitting process.</p> 
<p>But the legislation has drawn sharp opposition from conservatives who claim it could benefit renewable energy projects already benefitting from tax incentives, plus limit the Trump administration’s ability to block projects like offshore wind.</p> 
<p>“Believe me, nobody hates wind turbines more than me — except the president of the United States,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.). "We all need assurances."</p> 
<p>He paused, and added: "Assurances sometimes just aren't good enough."</p> 
<p>Van Drew and Reps. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) teamed up with House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) in writing a letter to Trump this week that warned the Westerman bill — which passed out of committee with bipartisan support — "undermines your stated policy agenda of rightfully ending offshore wind development and other 'Green New Scam' projects approved under the poor leadership of the Biden Administration, particularly development off the Atlantic Coast."</p> 
<p>They are mainly concerned about language added to the bill during the recent Natural Resources markup of the Westerman measure that could limit the administration’s ability to scrap an already-issued permit — a provision members on both sides of the aisle support.</p> 
<p>Van Drew said in an interview he had heard that the White House wanted to make sure the legislation would not promote offshore wind, which could make this bipartisan amendment problematic in a final product.</p> 
<p>But Westerman and other lawmakers want any permitting overhaul bill to be “technology neutral” after criticizing Democrats for putting policies in place that would benefit renewable energy.</p> 
<p>Westerman defended his product Wednesday, saying the White House has been briefed and is “well aware of where we are.”</p> 
<p>He added, “I expect the administration to still support the bill. I haven’t gotten any indication the administration isn’t supportive of the bill.”</p> 
<p>A White House spokesperson did not return a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), one of the House's most conservative voices, has also expressed reservations about the Westerman legislation.</p> 
<p>"I don’t want to fast-track any of the wind and solar. It’s still not a neutral playing field because it’s subsidized," said Roy, who pushed — unsuccessfully — for the immediate repeal of renewable energy credits in the GOP megabill enacted over the summer.</p> 
<p>Although some Democrats support the bill — including co-sponsor Jared Golden of Maine — others want stronger language to prevent the president from scrapping permits, among other changes.</p> 
<p>The League of Conservation Voters is urging lawmakers to vote “no,” arguing that “the biggest problem right now is the fact the Trump administration is not allowing any wind, solar or battery projects to move forward in the permitting process.”</p> 
<p>This means opposition from even a handful of Republicans could tank a vote on a procedural rule to take up the bill on the chamber floor, which are typically party-line affairs.</p> 
<p>Westerman said earlier this week that he was looking to meet with bill critics. Indeed, he was seen chatting with Smith on the House floor Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>“Hopefully we’ll work through it and get to a point where we can get the bill on the floor and get a good vote on it,” Westerman said.</p>

      <title>Senate GOP still not interested in nixing blue slips, Thune says</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune poured cold water on a fresh call by President Donald Trump for Republicans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/21/trump-us-attorneys-republicans-00617024" target="_blank">nix the "blue slip" practice</a> that gives senators an effective veto over presidential nominees to certain posts in their states.</p> 
<p>“There are many Republican senators, way more Republican senators who are interested in preserving that than those who aren’t," Thune told reporters. He comparing it to the overwhelming GOP sentiment in favor of keeping the 60-vote filibuster rule, which Trump also opposes.</p> 
<p>The blue slip precedent applies to nominees to serve as district judges, U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals. Among the Trump appointees who have not gotten Democratic assent is Alina Habba, his pick for U.S. attorney in New Jersey who was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/alina-habba-steps-down-as-new-jerseys-top-federal-prosecutor-00680823" target="_blank">recently disqualified from her acting role</a> by a federal court.</p> 
<p>Opposition from Democrats is not the only obstacle to confirming more Trump appointees, however: Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said during a committee meeting Thursday he would like to process more judicial nominees but is waiting on Trump to send them.</p> 
<p>According to his prepared remarks, Grassley said he would also like to advance more U.S. attorney picks, but “I’m hamstrung waiting for background investigations and other paperwork from the administration.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republicans just showed how divided they are over health care. Thursday's Senate votes could expose the party’s strife even further.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans know both parties’ health care proposals are doomed Thursday. But as Democrats prepare to unite behind a three-year extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson can’t get Republicans on the same page.</p> 
<p><b><i>—&nbsp;</i>In the Senate: </b>Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is the only definite GOP defector on Thursday’s vote on a framework by Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that would <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/cassidy-crapo-unveil-alternative-to-obamacare-subsidies-00682315" target="_blank">expand health savings accounts</a> rather than extend the enhanced Obamacare tax credits.</p> 
<p>But a handful of Republicans have not yet said how they would vote, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. And Florida Sen. Rick Scott — who has a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/20/congress/rick-scott-releases-obamacare-subsidy-alternative-00664146" target="_blank">competing proposal of his own</a> — said he’s still reviewing the Crapo-Cassidy bill.</p> 
<p>Thune is already messaging around Thursday’s near-certain failure and suggesting it’ll spur more serious negotiations.</p> 
<p>“When we get through this exercise this week the question is, ‘Are there enough Democrats who want to fix the problem?’” he told reporters Wednesday. “I think there’s a path forward. ... Obviously we don’t have a lot of time to do this, but I think there are ways in which you could, where there’s a will.”</p> 
<p><b>— In the House:</b> At least 10 Republicans on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/frustrated-republicans-move-to-force-obamacare-vote-as-warnings-mount-about-the-midterms-00685423" target="_blank">signed a bipartisan discharge petition</a> authored by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine) that would extend the enhanced tax credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) also moved Wednesday to file a discharge petition on <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/new-aca-subsidy-extension-bill-draws-16-gop-co-sponsors-00685285" target="_blank">their own proposal</a> that would extend subsidies for a year with new guardrails.</p> 
<p>Both efforts are direct challenges to House leaders who appear determined to let the subsidies lapse. But they would likely need all House Democrats — and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is pushing a measure to compel a vote on a three-year extension. Asked if he would support Fitzpatrick’s bill Wednesday night, Jeffries said he had not had the opportunity to look at it yet.</p> 
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told POLITICO he’s “not a fan of discharge petitions,” adding that the extension framework being proposed in the Fitzpatrick-Golden bill is one of many that has split the GOP conference.</p> 
<p>But Golden and other centrists are urging leaders not to brush off brewing discontent.</p> 
<p>“Leadership, no matter who they are, in both parties, House and Senate, should pay attention to what’s going on with discharge petitions,” Golden said.</p> 
<p><b>— From the White House: </b>Meanwhile, lawmakers are getting mixed signals about whether President Donald Trump wants Republicans to utilize the filibuster-skirting process of reconciliation to advance a party-line package to address affordability concerns, including health care.</p> 
<p>Asked Wednesday if he wants to see another megabill move through the Hill next year, Trump <a href="https://x.com/MicaSoellnerDC/status/1998866841314455599?s=20" target="_blank">told reporters</a> “we don’t need it.” But hours later, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair <a href="https://x.com/semafor/status/1998899662145646906?s=46&amp;t=ncdqfRV74gcQrRg3XkYQbA" target="_blank">told Semafor</a> the administration “would love to do” another reconciliation bill.</p> 
<p>“That’s really a partisan tool, and then obviously there’s bipartisan pathways too,” Blair said. “Which one opens up is largely contingent on whether or not the Democrats want to work on anything.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Democrats are uneasy about a push to restore Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51338" data-person-id="51338">Henry Cuellar</a> to a powerful committee role following a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/henry-cuellar-pardon-reelection-party-00674518" target="_blank">pardon from President Donald Trump</a>, potentially complicating his bid to regain influence over federal spending.</p> 
<p>Cuellar relinquished his post as the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee overseeing Homeland Security funding in 2024 after he was indicted on federal corruption charges. But following Trump’s pardon last week, party leaders have indicated that he is now eligible to retake the post under caucus rules.</p> 
<p>But not all of his fellow House Democrats are comfortable with a lawmaker accused of bribery and other offenses regaining direct control over more than $60 billion in annual spending, especially with a parallel Ethics Committee investigation still in motion. Compounding these concerns are Cuellar’s relatively conservative views on border policy and his potential sway over the budgets for agencies including Border Patrol and ICE.</p> 
<p>The matter is in the hands of the 27 Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee, who are set to take a secret ballot vote Thursday to determine Cuellar’s future on the panel.</p> 
<p>Several have private misgivings, and the fact that the vote is even happening means at least one Democratic appropriator privately objected to Cuellar’s return as ranking member. Otherwise, he would have been approved by acclamation.</p> 
<p>“That position is critical — it's Homeland Security,” said a Democratic appropriator granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations. “Your moral values are important — at least mine are — and I can't look at myself in the mirror and vote for him.”</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307305" data-person-id="307305">Lauren Underwood</a> of Illinois, who has served as the top Democrat on Homeland Security since Cuellar was indicted, could vote to keep Cuellar out so she can keep the job. Another appropriator, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196272" data-person-id="196272">Grace Meng</a> of New York, said Wednesday she was undecided on the matter.</p> 
<p>Other wild cards include Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/429181" data-person-id="429181">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a> of Washington, who led a push to formally reprimand a Democratic colleague last month, and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/75165" data-person-id="75165">Mike Quigley</a> of Illinois, who might vote in state solidarity with Underwood. Quigley had <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/03/congress/mike-quigley-takes-a-shot-at-house-democratic-grandees-00382170" target="_blank">been leapfrogged</a> by a more senior lawmaker who returned to the panel and has voiced criticism of Democratic leaders since then.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Cuellar declined to comment.</p> 
<p>The veteran Texas Democrat has been quietly canvassing members about regaining his role and reassuring those in his party who question the optics of wiping away an indictment sought by former President Joe Biden’s Justice Department at a time when the party is focusing on Trump’s alleged ethical violations.</p> 
<p>Top party leaders have not weighed in directly on the matter. House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> said Tuesday that Cuellar was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/henry-cuellar-appropriations-00683379" target="_blank">likely to regain</a> his committee leadership position, citing the caucus rules, while Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51351" data-person-id="51351">Rosa DeLauro</a> of Connecticut, the top Appropriations Democrat, in a statement merely acknowledged the Thursday vote.</p> 
<p>“We are holding a meeting tomorrow to discuss several issues, including who will serve as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee,” the statement said.</p> 
<p>The dilemma comes as some Democrats are making a high-profile push to police ethical transgressions in the party ranks. Last month, almost two dozen Democrats led by Gluesenkamp Perez <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/12/congress/mgp-vs-chuy-garcia-00650119" target="_blank">broke ranks to reprimand</a> outgoing Illinois Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/304652" data-person-id="304652">Chuy García</a> for apparently engineering his surprise retirement announcement to ensure a favored ally would succeed him.</p> 
<p>Democrats have railed against Trump’s use of his clemency powers, which has benefited political allies and major donors. Cuellar’s pardon puts him in the company of such figures as former Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich and ex-Rep. George Santos, who are odious to Democrats.</p> 
<p>“I've had nothing but good interactions with Henry in Congress, but we can't be the party of following the law and say it's just fine to break it and get a pardon from Trump,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227127" data-person-id="227127">Seth Moulton</a> (D-Mass.), who is running for Senate.</p> 
<p>Several other Democrats this week aired criticism of Trump’s pardons without specifically commenting on Cuellar and his bid to regain power inside the Democratic Caucus.</p> 
<p>“President Trump's continued efforts to pardon politicians that are either convicted or accused of corruption is just wrong,” said Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/25648" data-person-id="25648">Andy Kim </a>(D-N.J.). “And this is exactly the kind of problem that causes so many Americans to lose trust and faith in our politics.”</p> 
<p>Kim, a former member of the House, succeeded Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who is currently serving a prison sentence for bribery and other charges.</p> 
<p>“I don’t agree with any of the president’s pardons of members of Congress,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259488" data-person-id="259488">Angie Craig</a> (D-Minn.), who is also running for Senate.</p> 
<p>Cuellar was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/03/congress/cuellar-indicted-00155977" target="_blank">indicted on federal corruption charges</a> that alleged he took some $600,000 in bribes from foreign entities. Still, the veteran lawmaker remains largely popular with his fellow Democrats, some of whom argued that with the indictment wiped away, the process had run its course.</p> 
<p>“Under our system of laws, you're still innocent until proven guilty,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/251521" data-person-id="251521">Troy Carter</a> (D-La.). “He was indicted but never went to trial — was never proven to be guilty, never proven to be innocent, because there was no trial, but the pardon overrides that. That’s how the ball bounces.”</p> 
<p>Others deflected criticism to Trump, who suggested in social media posts after the pardon that he expected Cuellar to retire or switch parties and run as a Republican in a gesture of gratitude. Instead Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat almost immediately after the pardon came through, and with the legal cloud over his campaign lifted, it increases the chances his seat will remain in Democratic hands in 2026.</p> 
<p>“Nothing else seems to compare to this president and the abuse of the pardon power to get things he wants, including potentially people switching their party affiliation,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/422519" data-person-id="422519">Greg Landsman</a> (D-Ohio).</p> 
<p>Cuellar’s allies quietly insist he shouldn’t be sidelined given his unique ability to win a South Texas district that Republicans have targeted for years — and recently redrew in hopes of ousting him. Now, with the pardon, even some Republicans acknowledge he’s in prime position to remain in Congress — and potentially hold a gavel next year if the majority flips.</p> 
<p>“He’s going to have a very merry Christmas,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51507" data-person-id="51507">Michael McCaul</a> (R-Texas).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of House Republicans moved to force a vote on extending Obamacare health insurance subsidies that will expire in just three weeks, directly challenging party leaders who appear <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/gop-obamacare-subsidies-expire-00684115" target="_blank">determined to let them lapse</a>.</p> 
<p>At least six Republicans signed a discharge petition filed Wednesday on a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6501" target="_blank">bill</a> authored by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/179757" data-person-id="179757">Jared Golden</a> (D-Maine) that would extend the expiring tax credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. The subsidies are currently used by more than 20 million Americans.</p> 
<p>“It's a time-sensitive matter, and it's an existential matter,” Fitzpatrick told reporters after filing the petition. “You try to do things through the normal course. You try to do things through regular order. You know, [when] all those remedies are exhausted, then you’ve got to go this route, unfortunately.”</p> 
<p>Another discharge petition, seeking a vote on a one-year subsidy extension authored by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260077" data-person-id="260077">Josh Gottheimer</a> (D-N.J.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.), was also filed Wednesday and quickly picked up support from several Republicans. </p> 
<p>The moves to sidestep Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> came as a growing number of mainstream House Republicans publicly warned that their leaders’ apparent plan to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/06/obamacare-plans-schumer-trump-congress-00679712" target="_blank">allow the tax credits to expire</a> without a replacement in place will cost them their majority in next year’s midterm elections.</p> 
<p>“If we fumble this health care ball, nothing else is going to matter,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259537" data-person-id="259537">John Rutherford</a> of Florida said. “If we don't win the majority in the midterms, then none of this matters. We can't do anything good then. I think everybody understands that.”</p> 
<p>Johnson did not include a subsidy extension in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/10/congress/no-house-gop-health-plan-00684401" target="_blank">menu of options he presented to members</a> in a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning, and some conservative hard-liners who attended spoke against the idea.</p> 
<p>But many members in the meeting spoke up to call for an extension, to the point that Republicans leaving the room thought that they had in fact decided to forge ahead with an extension.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196450" data-person-id="196450">Jeff Van Drew</a> (R-N.J.) said it would be a “bad move” for Republicans to allow the tax credits to lapse, adding that he was “worried about my colleagues.”</p> 
<p>“There's a lot of good people who won by one, two, three or four votes,” he said. “Do I think this issue is worth a couple points in an election? Yeah, I do.”</p> 
<p>The Republicans joining Fitzpatrick in signing the discharge petition include Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227109" data-person-id="227109">Don Bacon</a> of Nebraska, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/478639" data-person-id="478639">Rob Bresnahan</a> of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260571" data-person-id="260571">Kevin Kiley</a> of California, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/390300" data-person-id="390300">Mike Lawler</a> of New York and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/194184" data-person-id="194184">Ryan Mackenzie</a> of Pennsylvania, with New York Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/81211" data-person-id="81211">Nick LaLota</a> also indicating he planned to sign. Kiggans signed the petition to discharge her own bill, along with Fitzpatrick, Lawler, Mackenzie and Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/159021" data-person-id="159021">David Valadao</a> of California. </p> 
<p>That would be enough to force a vote eventually if all House Democrats sign on to the proposal, but that is by no means assured. House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> is pushing a separate discharge effort on a three-year subsidy extension that does not include new eligibility requirements.</p> 
<p>"There’s one discharge position that I'm committed to at the moment," he said Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Even if either petition garnered the necessary 218 signatures, it would not trigger a vote before the Dec. 31 expiration of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits passed under former President Joe Biden. Either measure is subject to a waiting period of at least seven legislative days under House rules, with only six session days left in the year.</p> 
<p>Golden, a centrist Democrat who is retiring after his term ends, said leaders of both parties should pay heed to this discharge petition and others that have succeeded this Congress.</p> 
<p>“Leadership, no matter who they are, in both parties, House and Senate, should pay attention to what's going on with discharge petitions,” he said.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump has so far not weighed in publicly on the extension of the subsidies, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693" target="_blank">saying only</a> that he “wants to give money to the people,” not to insurance companies. Various GOP plans have been proposed that would direct money to health savings accounts instead of premium subsidies that go directly to insurers.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans are expected to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/senate-republican-heath-vote-00683250" target="_blank">support one such proposal</a> in a Thursday vote, but it’s not clear it can get more support than the three-year clean extension favored by Democrats.</p> 
<p>None of the alternative proposals has reached critical mass inside the House GOP, and without an extension, premiums for some enrollees on Affordable Care Act marketplaces will soar by hundreds of dollars within a matter of weeks, fueling the panic in the Republican ranks.</p> 
<p>While more GOP lawmakers are speaking out about the subsidy cliff, it’s not clear how many more will be willing to sign a discharge petition — which is typically considered a major breach of party loyalty and an option of last resort.</p> 
<p>For instance, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/367391" data-person-id="367391">Monica De La Cruz</a> (R-Texas) said in an interview she wants to lower health care costs and noted she’s signed onto a plan including a two-year subsidy extension.</p> 
<p>But she said she would have to think about whether she would sign onto a discharge petition.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders have argued, including at Wednesday morning’s conference meeting, that the subsidies are wasteful and that there is not enough internal support to extend them. But others in the party ranks have their doubts.</p> 
<p>“I call bullshit on that,” said one conservative House Republican in a deep-red seat who was granted anonymity to speak frankly. “Most people here know we need a bridge.”</p>

      <title>Dems press for changes to crypto bill in counteroffer to GOP</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats negotiating a major cryptocurrency bill told key Senate Banking Republicans this week they hope to strengthen prohibitions on stablecoin yield payments and further address concerns about illicit finance, according to <a href="https://politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-09c4-d5ec-abbb-d9d64a3b0000" target="_blank"><u>a summary of a counteroffer obtained by POLITICO</u></a>.</p> 
<p>The document, which summarizes requests that Democrats sent to Senate Banking GOP negotiators on Monday, came after Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/gop-crypto-compromise-offer-00683813" target="_blank">sent an initial offer late last week</a> for a compromise market structure bill, titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.</p> 
<p>"We have accepted significant portions of RFIA – including meaningful concessions on major elements like token classification – in an effort to meet Republicans where they are," the summary of the Democratic counteroffer said. "However, despite these substantial compromises, the offer Republicans sent on December 4th still fails to meet the core principles Democrats released in September."</p> 
<p>The group of Democrats working on the crypto bill “is concerned that payments of interest or yield on stablecoin balances could pull deposits from the banking system, especially from community banks that play a pivotal role in supporting underserved communities and operate under Community Reinvestment Act obligations,” the document said. “Yield also incentivizes risky behavior and could threaten the financial system if a stablecoin were to lose its value.”</p> 
<p>The document also said the working group is “committed to ensuring full slates of commissioners at the” agencies that will be tasked with overseeing digital assets under the bill, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> 
<p>It also said Democrats are pressing for “limits on elected officials and their families from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets while in office.” It additionally included an array of illicit finance provisions and token classification provisions that Democrats are seeking to include in the measure.</p> 
<p>Banking Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is pressing to hold a markup before lawmakers leave for the holiday break at the end of next week, but Democrats are pushing back, casting uncertainty over the timeline for the effort. Crypto-friendly Democrats exited a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning pessimistic about the possibility of a committee vote next week.</p> 
<p>“We’re not ready for it,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a centrist Nevada Democrat who sits on the Banking panel. “We’ve still got to work through illicit activity, money laundering issues that need to be addressed.”</p> 
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a senior Banking Committee member, said “we have wide swaths where we don’t have agreement — even any language.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Scott said in a statement that “Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee have spent months negotiating in good faith, circulating multiple rounds of bipartisan text, soliciting extensive stakeholder feedback, and feedback from their Democratic colleagues.”</p> 
<p>“Chairman Scott remains committed to a bipartisan path forward, but progress requires coming to a compromise on legislative text, not press statements or shifting objections,” said the spokesperson, Jeff Naft.</p> 
<p>The comments come amid a flurry of crypto activity on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ruben Gallego met Wednesday with White House crypto adviser Patrick Witt, along with staff from the Treasury Department.</p> 
<p>Lawmakers involved in the talks are discussing a potential bipartisan member-level meeting on Thursday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss closed-door negotiations. Democrats are also set to meet separately with big bank CEOs on Thursday about the crypto bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY, New York — The <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/28/new-york-upstate-blue-wave-mamdani-00668749" target="_blank"><u>statewide blue wave</u></a> in which New York Democrats made big gains in nearly every corner of the state this November had one glaring exception: Nassau County.</p> 
<p>While Empire State Democrats scored one of their best election nights on record, Republicans held down America’s archetypal suburb, with GOP candidates notching an 11-0 record in contested executive branch races in Nassau. In the marquee race, County Executive Bruce Blakeman improved on his 2021 performance after four years of wholeheartedly embracing President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>Blakeman is hoping to ride that success into next year: He launched <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/republican-bruce-blakeman-planning-to-enter-race-for-new-york-governor-00681465" target="_blank"><u>a 2026 gubernatorial bid</u></a> Tuesday touting his electability.</p> 
<p>“While Democrats made gains nationwide on election night, the Republican party shined bright on Long Island,” the narrator of <a href="https://x.com/NassauExec/status/1998383059863757225" target="_blank"><u>his launch video</u></a> said. “Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman won a Democrat County by 12 percent.”</p> 
<p>Whether Blakeman’s GOP primary opponent Rep. Elise Stefanik can replicate those numbers will be a key question facing Republican voters next June. Blakeman told POLITICO his recent win came down to holding fast to pocketbook issues, hiring more cops and connecting with groups Republicans have ignored in the past. Others say his decisive victory might simply stem from a strong local party organization.</p> 
<p>Whatever the secret of his success, the importance of Nassau extends far beyond next year’s gubernatorial race. It will also be crucial to determining control of the House. </p> 
<p>And it is not just Republicans whose future stands to be shaped by Nassau’s political trends. Democrats have spent years bickering over whether party members in the county have focused too much on distancing themselves from the far left. Moderate Nassau Democrats say progressives like New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have made their jobs tougher.</p> 
<p>“Most of the television commercials that they put up were all about ‘Mamdani, Mamdani, democratic socialists,’” Nassau Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs said. “Their tagline was, in effect, ‘Vote Republican and save Nassau County from becoming a socialist county.’ That plays well with a moderate audience.”</p> 
<p>Democratic struggles in Nassau County have become a regular through line, revisited with each election cycle. While it was at the heart of the national blue wave in 2017 and 2018, the GOP won big there in 2021 local races. Four years after a 16-point Democratic win in Nassau in the 2018 gubernatorial election, the party suffered an 11-point loss in 2022. Then in 2024, Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Nassau County since 1988.</p> 
<p>How that pattern plays out next year remains an open question.</p> 
<p>Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat in a battleground Nassau swing district, “is the number one target in the country for Republicans,” said Larry Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. “They really think they can win in that district and they’re going to put an unlimited amount of money in.”</p> 
<p>An effective GOP candidate at the top of the ticket would help considerably toward that end.</p> 
<p>Stefanik’s team disputed the idea that Blakeman has a magic formula for electoral success, pointing to his unsuccessful bids for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/nyregion/republicans-pick-challenger-for-state-comptroller.html" target="_blank"><u>state comptroller</u></a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2009/01/07/goper-drops-out-of-mayoral-run/" target="_blank"><u>New York City mayor</u></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/nyregion/04repubs.html" target="_blank"><u>U.S. Senate</u></a>. He last ran for higher office when he lost a congressional bid in 2014 — the same year Stefanik flipped a House seat with a 21-point victory.</p> 
<p>Yet Blakeman believes he has a solid case to make.</p> 
<p>He attributed his success this election cycle to holding true to past promises to not raise taxes and hire more police officers, while also building connections to groups Republicans haven’t focused on in the past. He rattled off a long list of outreach efforts undertaken by the county in recent years, such as a Feliz Navidad celebration and a Lunar New Year festival.</p> 
<p>“We also reached out to the Muslim community and talked to them about things that were important to them,” Blakeman said. “I appointed the first Muslim police chaplain in Nassau County history, and shortly I will be appointing the first Sikh police chaplain.”</p> 
<p>Trump, who has become politically toxic in many New York suburbs, will undoubtedly be a factor in next year’s race. On Monday, he described both Blakeman and Stefanik as “great,” and while he has not yet expressed a preference for either, that could change. And arguably no local official in the northeast has done more to associate themselves with Trumpism than Blakeman.</p> 
<p>Under his leadership, Nassau County <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/long-island-democrats-seek-reimbursement-for-trump-rally/" target="_blank"><u>spent more than $1 million</u></a> on police overtime hosting Trump for a campaign rally last fall. Blakeman has been New York’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/hochul-nassau-transgender-athletics-00142865" target="_blank"><u>most visible opponent</u></a> of letting transgender girls participate in female sports and has had the <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2025/02/nassau-county-deputizes-local-cops-act-ice-agents/402777/" target="_blank"><u>county partner</u></a> with ICE on immigration enforcement efforts. In late November, he announced a <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/28/us-news/nassau-exec-bruce-blakeman-plans-a-wall-of-surveillance-at-nyc-border-after-mamdani-win/" target="_blank"><u>wall of surveillance</u></a> on the Queens border to conduct facial recognition on visitors from Mamdani’s New York.</p> 
<p>“I never ran away from President Trump,” Blakeman told POLITICO. “I supported President Trump, and I was very vocal about my support for President Trump”</p> 
<p>The approach is a far cry from how Nassau County Democrats have handled Mamdani.</p> 
<p>Jacobs, who also serves as chair of the state Democratic Party, famously distanced himself from the mayor-elect in the fall, declining to offer an endorsement after Mamdani became the Democratic nominee. And he’s hardly the only local Democrat who falls into that category: “Mamdani’s reckless agenda filled with unachievable promises and contempt for certain groups threatens NY’s economy and safety,”<a href="https://x.com/LauraAGillen/status/1968005348037476728" target="_blank"><u>Gillen said</u></a> this fall.</p> 
<p>Democrats based in New York City contend this is exactly what their counterparts on Long Island should not be doing.</p> 
<p>“When the leading Democrats in the county are telling everyone that the Democratic Party sucks, it’s hard to convince voters to vote for your party,” said state Sen. Deputy Leader Mike Gianaris, who heads the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm. “They should start looking inside themselves and start trying to make a positive case for Democrats, or I think they can expect this to continue.”</p> 
<p>Unlike in Nassau, Long Island’s neighboring Suffolk County showed significant signs of the pendulum swinging back to the left this November. Democrats grew their share of the vote by 10 or more points in four of the five top town races, and they flipped seats in places like Shelter Island and Riverhead.</p> 
<p>Democrats haven’t been completely without hopeful signs in Nassau either.</p> 
<p>They won a victory last month in a newly-drawn county legislative district, denying Blakeman’s allies a supermajority and giving them the ability to put their foot in the door during budget talks. In 2024, Tom Suozzi broke the Republicans’ hold on four congressional seats by winning a special election. Gillen won another seat later that year, thanks to a two-point victory in a district that favored Democrats by 11 points as recently as 2020.</p> 
<p>But even the good Democratic vibes in the 2024 congressional races underscored a long-standing issue in the county — winning back the seat in Suozzi’s special election would not have been necessary if local Democrats had done opposition research into the now-disgraced former Rep. George Santos before the 2022 election.</p> 
<p>The failure to do so illustrates another reality in the area. After decades of controlling Nassau, Republicans built a well-oiled machine.</p> 
<p>“The relative strength of the organizations — it’s just not even close,” said Levy, who likened the GOP’s political operation to that of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. “At a time when all over the country, political organizations are shrinking in influence for a variety of reasons, Nassau still has an old-fashioned Daley machine-like operation that can get a vote out in ways that the Democrats can’t.”</p> 
<p>Democrats didn’t do much to end that structural disadvantage when they won power in 2017.</p> 
<p>“Arguably the Democrats could have, should have done more to leverage the patronage opportunities to raise money and create more foot soldiers to work politically,” Levy said. But any steps they made in that direction were halted when the political winds started to shift: “Anything that happened before the pandemic almost doesn’t count.”</p> 
<p>Jacobs, who said his party was outspent by a more than four-to-one margin in the county executive’s race, didn’t disagree with the characterization.</p> 
<p>“They raised and spent $15 million. That’s an extraordinary amount of money,” he said. “That was supplemented by both county mailings and town mailings that, in my judgement and other peoples’ judgement, were campaign-like pieces paid for by the taxpayer.”</p> 
<p>That onslaught of ads built off years of tying local Democrats to policies like bail reform or high-density housing or candidates like Mamdani, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Kathy Hochul. The Democratic brand “is really doing poorly” in the area, Jacobs said.</p> 
<p>“People — even at the doors when you’re collecting petitions, even when they’re Democrats — are upset with our party,” he said. “That’s been driven by a really well-funded consistent campaign by Republicans to set the narrative that all Democrats are either wild extremists themselves or so afraid of them that they bend to whatever the far left in our party wants. Neither of which is true, but too many people believe it.”</p> 
<p>Nassau Republicans, meanwhile, aren’t shying away from a president whom the opposition characterizes as an extremist.</p> 
<p>“In a county with 110,000 more Democrats, to win by 35,000 votes is something that is very special,” Blakeman said. “You have to be true to your values, and not a phony.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republican leaders presented no firm plan Tuesday for advancing health care legislation as anxiety rises in the GOP ranks over the impending expiration of key Obamacare subsidies at the end of the year.</p> 
<p>Instead, Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> presented attendees of a closed-door conference meeting with list of 10 possible policies that could get votes in the coming weeks or months, according to five Republicans in the room. </p> 
<p>Some were more specific, such as an expansion of health savings accounts and an overhaul of pharmaceutical benefit manager oversight. Others were vague, including one bullet point that simply said, "Innovation." The list did not include an extension of the expiring tax credits.</p> 
<p>The presentation was followed by a heated discussion over the path forward on health care for the party, and vulnerable members including Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.) stood up to warn against the political fallout of failing to extend the expiring subsidies.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/0a/78/b9ba80724925888e1393fbcf672c/gop-health.jpg" alt="A slide on GOP health care legislative options presented at a House Republican Conference meeting on Dec. 10, 2025." data-portal-copyright="House Republican Conference" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="A slide on GOP health care legislative options presented at a House Republican Conference meeting on Dec. 10, 2025."/><p>Some later expressed their dismay at how poorly they believe GOP leaders have handled the topic.</p> 
<p>“There was a general uneasiness because nothing is coming together,” said a House Republican, one of several granted anonymity to speak candidly about the private meeting.</p> 
<p>“We wasted so much time,” one conservative Republican said, also lamenting the lack of a unified GOP plan with just seven session days left in the year. </p> 
<p>More than 20 GOP members spanning various factions inside the conference lined up at microphones to weigh in at one point. Hard-liners, for instance, raised opposition to any extension of the subsidies if they don't include further restrictions abortion coverage, a view that clashes with Republicans in at-risk districts next fall. </p> 
<p>“There was no consensus,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/195970" data-person-id="195970">Ralph Norman</a> (R-S.C.) said.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders continue to believe they are on track to vote on several bills next week on some less controversial items, such as the HSA expansion and funding a program to reduce out-of-pocket costs for Obamacare enrollees. But an extension of the expiring tax credits is not in the cards, according to three other Republicans granted anonymity to describe leadership thinking.</p> 
<p>Johnson indicated in the meeting that Republicans could continue working on health care into the first half of next year — just ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are requesting the Justice Department and FBI hand over internal records related to six Democratic members of Congress with military and law enforcement backgrounds who filmed an anti-Trump video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.</p> 
<p>It comes after some of the Democrats who appeared in the video <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/democrats-fbi-trump-00668584" target="_blank">disclosed late last month</a> that the FBI had contacted the House and Senate sergeants at arms requesting voluntary interviews. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has separately requested a briefing by Dec. 10 of the review into the military record of one of the Democrats, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a Navy veteran.</p> 
<p>“We write with grave concern that the Trump Administration is weaponizing the Federal Bureau of Investigation against federal lawmakers who merely restated current law,” reads the letter, spearheaded by top Senate Judiciary Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-05f6-d744-a5db-0ff6f0d90000" target="_blank">and obtained first by POLITICO</a>. “This abuse of federal law enforcement authority as an instrument of retribution against the President’s political opponents is a threat to the constitutional freedoms of all Americans.”</p> 
<p>Senators added in the letter that it was "particularly alarming” that the FBI would reportedly push its domestic terrorism agents to open up a seditious conspiracy investigation into the six Democrats — two senators and four House members — who participated in the video message.</p> 
<p>“It is facially unconstitutional to prosecute protected speech, whether that speech is by the American people or their representatives in Congress, and it is absurd to contend that statements reiterating the law alone are a predicate for a seditious conspiracy investigation,” the Judiciary Democrats wrote.</p> 
<p>They added, “The Department of Justice’s resources would be better spent ensuring that the Department of Defense is following the law as it conducts military action.”</p> 
<p>Durbin and his colleagues are requesting Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel hand over any documents or communications by Dec. 29, dating back to Nov. 18, between either of the two agencies and President Donald Trump or other White House officials relating to the six lawmakers’ statements.</p> 
<p>They are also seeking any related documents or communications since Nov. 18 between the DOJ or FBI with the Washington Field Office or the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. They are additionally seeking any similar records between the FBI and Justice Department and the Department of Defense. </p> 
<p>Spokespeople for the FBI and DOJ declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is endorsing her former House colleague Elaine Luria's comeback bid in the latest effort by Democrats to clear the primary in a highly targeted purple district. </p> 
<p>"I am excited to support Elaine Luria’s campaign for Congress, because Virginians deserve a dedicated public servant who is focused on delivering for the people of Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore,” Spanberger said in a statement. </p> 
<p>Both women flipped GOP-held seats in the 2018 midterms and became part of a bloc of incoming House Democrats with national security backgrounds. </p> 
<p>"Since our first campaign together when we made history in 2018, Governor-elect Spanberger and I have worked closely together to lower prices, cut health care costs, and invest in Virginia. I look forward to continuing our work together to lower costs for working families and deliver for the people of Hampton Roads," Luria said. </p> 
<p>The district, which is currently represented by GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, is the most competitive in Virginia and has flipped between parties four times over the past two decades. </p> 
<p>Virginia Democrats expect it to become bluer in a potential redraw. Navy reservist James Osyf suspended his Democratic campaign Tuesday, saying in a statement he would "await clarity on the outcome of the Commonwealth’s redistricting plan.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get ready for the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies to lapse.</p> 
<p>All signs are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/gop-obamacare-subsidies-expire-00684115" target="_blank">pointing in that direction</a> as President Donald Trump refuses to endorse an extension and Senate Republicans coalesce behind a plan from Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that would end the Obamacare tax credits and instead expand <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/senate-republican-heath-vote-00683250" target="_blank">government-funded health savings accounts</a>.</p> 
<p>Now House Republicans are racing to prepare their own health care framework to vote on next week before leaving for the holidays — one that also likely would not extend the expiring Obamacare subsidies, which were supercharged as part of the Democrats’ 2021 pandemic relief package.</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise will brief their conference Wednesday morning on all the options for this framework, which Scalise and relevant committee chairs helped craft.</p> 
<p>“It won’t just be concepts we’re talking about ... It’ll be very specific things that are available in bill format,” Scalise told reporters Tuesday, noting some provisions will reflect proposals that ultimately did not make it into the final GOP megabill over the summer. He said each piece will be presented individually “to see where the consensus is and let members decide.”</p> 
<p><b>— Moderates sound the alarm:</b> Many rank-and-file Republicans are still pushing for an extension, worried about voter backlash over the ensuing skyrocketing premiums. Even some Trump aides have advised that an extension would be politically prudent.</p> 
<p>“We can agree that the current construct is flawed, but that letting them expire is not acceptable,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said in an interview Tuesday. “That doesn’t work.”</p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick and Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) have been proposing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/brian-fitzpatrick-obamacare-bill-00664635" target="_blank">their own</a> blueprints <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/kiggans-house-gop-aca-00561747" target="_blank">that would include</a> extensions. But neither has earned approval from GOP leaders, who are under pressure from conservatives who say the tax credits are rife with fraud and abuse.</p> 
<p>Scalise didn’t rule out an extension Tuesday. Still, he said, “at the end of the day, we’ve got to do what the consensus of our members want to do.”</p> 
<p><b>— Don't rule out the discharge petition:&nbsp;</b>While Republicans might not currently have the support in their conference to pass an extension, the Fitzpatrick and Kiggans plans have bipartisan backing. Fitzpatrick told POLITICO last week he believes he has 218 votes for his bill and didn’t rule out filing a discharge petition to circumvent leadership and force a vote.</p> 
<p>Some House Republicans told POLITICO Tuesday they were even more inclined to back a discharge petition after Trump’s recent comments refusing to endorse an extension. That includes Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), who told reporters Tuesday he would support a discharge petition for either the Fitzpatrick or Kiggans proposal, if there were no other options.</p> 
<p>“I respect the speaker tremendously, but I disagree with them on this,” Van Drew said. “We just can’t listen to a handful of people.”</p> 
<p><b>— Eyes on the White House: </b>The Trump administration has yet to provide clear guidance on what they want Congress to pass. But Tuesday night, POLITICO saw James Braid and James Blair — the White House director of legislative affairs and deputy chief of staff, respectively — head into a meeting with House GOP leaders and committee chairs.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Dems blast Senate GOP health plan: </b>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will host a news conference on health insurance premiums at 10:15 a.m. It comes a day after he criticized Senate Republicans’ <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/senate-republican-heath-vote-00683250" target="_blank">health plan</a> as “dead on arrival.”</p> 
<p><b>— House votes on NDAA: </b>The House is scheduled to vote on the National Defense Authorization Act Wednesday afternoon as a group of hard-liners weigh whether to hold up the bill over complaints it would give aid to Ukraine and wouldn’t include a central banking digital currency ban. The big question is whether Republicans will be able to adopt the procedural rule governing floor debate on the NDAA.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are moving decisively away from extending key Obamacare tax credits that help more than 20 million Americans pay for health insurance — following direct cues from President Donald Trump while also stoking ire among many in the GOP who fear severe political repercussions.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693" target="_blank">Monday interview with POLITICO</a>, Trump refused to endorse a continuation of the expiring subsidies, even as his administration faces mounting pressure to address rising costs for Americans. He instead laid out his own vision for health care: “I want to give the money to the people, not to the insurance companies.”</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans now plan to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/09/congress/senate-republican-heath-vote-00683250" target="_blank">offer a proposal for a vote Thursday</a> that would let the subsidies expire and instead encourage the use of health savings accounts. That abrupt shift in strategy is in turn putting new pressure on House GOP leaders to come up with their own health plan, according to four people who attended a closed-door meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson and senior Republicans Tuesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>Yet after months of pressure from competing factions, lawmakers inside the meeting didn’t reach a conclusion and Johnson is <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/04/congress/johnson-house-gop-health-care-plan-00676661" target="_blank">still trying to figure out</a> what that plan should be. House GOP staff Tuesday were prepping a health care framework to give Republicans something to vote on next week before they leave Washington for the holidays — one that, for now, does not include an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>For many Republicans facing tough reelection races and even some in deep-red areas with a high reliance on the tax credits, following Trump’s one-sentence policy prescription would harm Americans and make for political disaster as the Dec. 31 expiration of the tax credits looms.</p> 
<p>“We can agree that the current construct is flawed, but that letting them expire is not acceptable,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said in an interview Tuesday. “That doesn’t work.”</p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick is pushing a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6501" target="_blank">competing proposal</a> that would extend the tax credits for two years while imposing an income cap and other eligibility restrictions. Fitzpatrick’s bill also includes new HSA provisions and a bipartisan package aimed at lowering drug costs, but he said it was unrealistic for GOP leaders to completely replace the subsidy framework in a matter of weeks.</p> 
<p>“They can just dig themselves into an ideological corner all day long — it’s not fixing the problem,” Fitzpatrick added. “We can’t live in this fantasy land.”</p> 
<p>But Johnson appears determined to cobble together a health care framework that will not include even a short-term extension of the subsidies, which <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/" target="_blank">can cut premiums</a> for many families by $1,000 a year or more. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2025/12/08/gop-struggles-on-affordability-message-00680485" target="_blank">blindsided members of his own leadership circle</a> and senior Republicans who have been involved in health care policy work when he announced last week his intentions to unveil a GOP health plan early this week and hold a vote before year's end.</p> 
<p>“What health care plan?” said one of the senior Republicans who has been involved in the talks and was granted anonymity to share a candid reaction to Johnson’s pledge.</p> 
<p>Turning Johnson’s promise into legislation has been difficult. As of Tuesday evening, the House GOP framework centered on an expansion of health savings accounts and funding for cost-sharing reductions — a type of Obamacare subsidy meant to reduce out-of-pocket health costs, according to three people granted anonymity to describe the deliberations.</p> 
<p>While the plan does not currently include a temporary subsidy extension, some senior House Republicans say it might still be on the table — including Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan, the No. 4 GOP leader, who said she believed it was still an option as she left the health care meeting Tuesday.</p> 
<p>It’s also still to be determined whether the plan will be offered up as a suite of individual bills or packaged together. But the goal is for GOP lawmakers to have “something” to vote on before the end of next week, according to one of the senior House Republicans involved in the talks — even if there is no time left for the Senate to pass it before the subsidies lapse.</p> 
<p>GOP members will be briefed on the talks during their closed-door conference meeting Wednesday morning, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal planning. They will not be presented with a formal plan, they said.</p> 
<p>The health care sprint also comes as Johnson faces down growing displeasure inside the GOP over his leadership style, where he has repeatedly sought to bulldoze internal dissent and march in lockstep with Trump. In this case, Johnson has so far sided with the bulk of his conference who want to see the Obamacare subsidies expire — even though some Trump aides have counseled that an extension would be politically prudent.</p> 
<p>The White House was on the cusp of endorsing a two-year continuation of the subsidies just before Thanksgiving, but top Republicans on the Hill were not fully consulted first and moved to quash the idea — to the horror of many in the rank-and-file who favor an extension.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think leadership understands just how upset people are,” said one House Republican who among several granted anonymity to speak frankly about internal conversations. “People are getting desperate.”</p> 
<p>In fact, according to six other House GOP lawmakers and senior aides with direct knowledge, enough Republicans could sign a discharge petition that would sidestep Johnson and force a vote on extending the expiring subsidies. One of those House Republicans said they would be willing to support a discharge of Fitzpatrick’s legislation, which largely mirrors the White House trial balloon, or another bill from Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) and is waiting to see details of what Johnson proposes as an alternative.</p> 
<p>“We shall see,” the lawmaker said.</p> 
<p>Some in the GOP who support an extension have floated a short-term patch until Jan. 30 in order to buy some more time to come up with a deal. Many Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill believe that once the tax credits expire, there could be a chance to work out a wider health care deal next month that could tackle issues such as HSAs and drug prices.</p> 
<p>While that argument has its merits on paper, people involved in the talks say a short-term punt wouldn’t make much sense for people trying to buy health insurance for the entire year and could create major logistical hassles.</p> 
<p>One of the many problems is the White House itself isn’t providing any clear guidance amid all the internal divisions. The Trump administration itself has been and still is deeply divided about allowing the Obamacare tax credits to lapse, according to two administration officials and three senior House Republicans involved in the conversations.</p> 
<p>“It depends on who you ask,” said a senior House Republican about the White House’s views on health care.</p> 
<p>One White House official said Tuesday that “policy teams are looking at a lot of different avenues” and that “three weeks is actually a lot of time for a lot of stuff to come together.” However, both the House and Senate are set to adjourn for the holidays at the end of next week.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank">Senate plan</a> now set for a vote Thursday, from Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho, quickly won support inside the GOP this week amid fears that the party would look hapless if they did not put up an alternative to <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank">Democrats’ plan</a> to extend the subsidies for three years.</p> 
<p>But there are still plenty of lawmakers who are anxious about voting to upend the health care system with the deadline looming and no signals from the White House on what Trump would accept.</p> 
<p>"There's just not enough time to do a comprehensive bill," one House Republican said, adding that the expiring subsidies will be “a problem for everyone” in the GOP.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Republicans will offer a <a href="http://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank">health care plan</a> for a vote Thursday alongside a Democratic proposal to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies, capping off days of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/senate-republicans-obamacare-health-00682318" target="_blank">furious behind-the-scenes debates</a>.</p> 
<p>The decision announced Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader John Thune is a U-turn from just a day prior, when GOP leadership appeared likely to skip a vote on a Republican alternative to the Democrats’ proposal, which would continue the expiring subsidies for three years.</p> 
<p>But that strategy sparked grumbling from various corners of the GOP conference, who believed they should put up their own plan to illustrate that their party has health care ideas, even if some Republican senators ultimately aren't supportive. The matter was discussed at a closed-door GOP policy lunch Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Some corners of the conference were caught off guard by the expectation that there wouldn't be a vote, especially as Democrats hammer them over health care, according to two people granted anonymity to speak candidly about the reason for the shift.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans ultimately agreed to vote on a proposal from Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who chair the Finance and HELP committees respectively. Their bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/cassidy-crapo-unveil-alternative-to-obamacare-subsidies-00682315" target="_blank">expands health savings accounts and includes funding</a> for Americans to spend on health expenses but does not extend the Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>“Our members decided that we’re going to vote on a Crapo-Cassidy proposal,” Thune told reporters.</p> 
<p>That fits in with a rough framework supported by President Donald Trump, who declined to commit to extending the subsidies in a Monday interview with POLITICO. “I want to give the money to the people, not to the insurance companies,” he said.</p> 
<p>But a White House official, granted anonymity to discuss the administration’s thinking, said that there was not a preferred plan among the several currently floating around Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>Neither the Crapo-Cassidy plan nor the Democratic proposal will get the 60 votes needed to advance Thursday. And it's far from clear if the Republican proposal will win the backing of all 53 GOP senators.</p> 
<p>Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who has his own competing proposals, said he’s “still looking at” the Crapo-Cassidy bill, for instance.</p> 
<p>Republicans have struggled perennially for years to unite around a health care plan. Thune acknowledged Tuesday that most, but potentially not all, of the conference would back the bill.</p> 
<p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said some in her party “still have questions about implementation” of the Cassidy-Cassidy plan, though she said it was good Republicans were putting something forward.</p> 
<p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday after the lunch that she was still reviewing the legislation.</p> 
<p>“There are many good provisions in that plan that I think would be helpful to driving down health care costs,” Collins said.</p> 
<p>Collins and Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/gop-senators-circulate-health-care-plans-ahead-of-thursday-vote-00680645" target="_blank">proposed a two-year extension</a> of the expiring Affordable Care Act credits with new eligibility restrictions such as income caps and minimum premium payments. If the enhanced subsidies expire, the tax credits will revert back to their original, pre-Covid levels.</p> 
<p>Other GOP senators could try to pass or set up votes this week on their own competing bills by seeking unanimous consent, according to their colleagues.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK — Brooklyn progressive Brad Lander is planning to launch his bid for Congress as soon as Wednesday, challenging Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/320509" data-person-id="320509">Dan Goldman</a> from the political left in a district that went big for Zohran Mamdani, three people familiar with his preparations told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>The city comptroller is expected to open his campaign with a pivotal endorsement from Mamdani, the democratic socialist mayor-elect’s first formal nod since his November election win upended the Democratic landscape. Lander has also sought support from progressive Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51605" data-person-id="51605">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/140963" data-person-id="140963">Elizabeth Warren</a>, according to two people close to Lander.</p> 
<p>Lander shot his campaign launch video, with some scenes from his Park Slope community, two people with knowledge of his operations said. And he is interviewing for the Working Families Party endorsement, four more people confirmed to POLITICO. The people looped into Lander’s plans were granted anonymity to protect a sensitive rollout process.</p> 
<p>Lander’s entry will mark New York progressives’ boldest salvo yet in primaries to unseat more mainstream party members on the heels of Mamdani’s ascension to the helm of the country’s largest city. The fiscal wonk and Israel critic is a favorite of left-leaning voters in the liberal congressional district, which encompasses lower Manhattan and northwest Brooklyn and overlaps Lander’s former City Council district.</p> 
<p>“These are urgent times when ICE agents are abducting our neighbors, Donald Trump is stealing money from New York City’s bank account. I think people are looking for leaders who will put their bodies on the line,” Lander told reporters Friday after <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/12/05/comptroller-brad-lander-pleads-not-guilty-in-ice-protest-as-he-mulls-run-for-congress/" target="_blank">pleading not guilty</a> to trespassing and related charges tied to <a href="https://x.com/emilyngo/status/1968769479623557346?s=20" target="_blank">his September sit-in protesting</a> the detention of migrants at 26 Federal Plaza. He said Friday he had not made a decision on running for Congress but was seriously considering it.</p> 
<p>Lander's team did not immediately comment on his plans Tuesday when contacted by POLITICO.</p> 
<p>Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo in Goldman’s 10th Congressional District by 23 points in the June mayoral primary. In that same contest, Lander placed third in the district, just a quarter of a percentage point behind Cuomo, the moderate former governor. Lander helped clear the democratic socialist’s path to the nomination <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/13/mamdani-lander-cross-endorsing-mayor-00405357" target="_blank">with a cross-endorsement deal</a> that many in the progressive movement <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/02/brad-lander-is-riding-a-wave-of-good-will-00436553" target="_blank">lauded as a sacrifice</a> for the cause. While Lander is a progressive and Working Families Party darling, he is not a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.</p> 
<p>Goldman — a Manhattan Democrat, second-term House member and former prosecutor — was lead counsel in President Donald Trump’s first impeachment process. While Goldman is a scion of the Levi Strauss empire and a staunch defender of Israel, he has championed progressive policies as co-sponsor of Medicare for All and Green New Deal legislation. The incumbent has advocated <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/12/05/mamdanis-volunteer-army-reassembles-00678203?nname=new-york-playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b74f0000&amp;nrid=0000014f-8906-d780-a9ef-9d7e2a4c0000#:~:text=Rep.%20Dan%20Goldman-,TAX%20MYSELF%3A,-Rep.%20Dan%20Goldman" target="_blank">for taxing the ultra-wealthy</a> — including himself — and criticized settler violence in the West Bank. Both Goldman and Lander are Jewish.</p> 
<p>Lander and Goldman are aligned in the resistance against Trump’s ramped-up deportation agenda and have <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/10/01/what-the-shutdown-means-for-new-york-00589342?nname=new-york-playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b74f0000&amp;nrid=0000014f-8906-d780-a9ef-9d7e2a4c0000#:~:text=Wong/Getty%20Images-,PRESSURE%20ON%20ICE%3A,-Rep.%20Dan%20Goldman" target="_blank">even worked in tandem.</a> Both Democrats are a frequent presence at 26 Federal Plaza, the lower Manhattan administrative building where migrants have been detained by masked federal agents as they attend immigration court hearings.</p> 
<p>“These are nonviolent, noncriminal people, often escaping terrible conditions in their country, seeking refuge here, and now, they are being yanked away from their families, detained and deported,” Goldman told reporters Monday as he and Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/193043" data-person-id="193043">Adriano Espaillat</a> and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51659" data-person-id="51659">Nydia Velázquez</a> unveiled legislation to protect migrants from arrest as they attend their court dates and follow pathways to legal status.</p> 
<p>At least two other progressive Democrats are considering a bid for Congress in the district. City Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the council’s Immigration Committee and a democratic socialist, and former Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, who came in second place to Goldman in the 2022 primary for the district, also appealed to the Manhattan and Brooklyn chapters of the Working Families Party for their support. Goldman did as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>TRUMP’S TAKE ON HEALTH TALKS —</b> President Donald Trump in an exclusive interview with POLITICO's Dasha Burns was noncommittal on the fate of Obamacare subsidies set to lapse at the end of the month, the latest sign that Republicans will let them expire.</p> 
<p>Pressed on whether he would intervene and ask Congress to extend the tax credits, Trump said, “I don’t know. I’m going to have to see.” He instead touted his rough vision for a health care revamp.</p> 
<p>“I want to give the people better health insurance for less money,” he said. “The people will get the money and they’re going to buy the health insurance that they want.”</p> 
<p>Watch the interview and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trump-dasha-burns-interview-europe-immigration-ukraine-00682016" target="_blank">read a rundown</a> of the newsiest bits on Latin America, the economy, the Supreme Court and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). “She was a loyal person until I wasn’t able to answer her phone calls,” he said.</p> 
<p><b>SENATE GOP SEARCHES FOR UNITY —</b> With just two days until Democrats get a vote on their proposal to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies, Republican senators <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/senate-republicans-obamacare-health-00682318" target="_blank">have yet to coalesce behind an alternative</a> to put up alongside it.</p> 
<p>“What signal would that send if Republicans say, ‘Yeah, we’re going to say no to the Democrats’ plan, but we’re not going to offer anything?’” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said. “The message that will send is, good luck to the American people, and we don’t really care.”</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans are expected to discuss their options at a closed-door lunch Tuesday afternoon and make a decision about which direction to take.</p> 
<p><b>— The competing proposals:</b> Factions of the conference are either ready to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies or replace them with new frameworks.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Monday praised a proposal by Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) expanding the use of health savings accounts and directing funding toward them — without extending the tax credits. Thune took steps Monday night to make the bill available for a vote later this week, as Republicans try to keep options on the table. But he didn’t commit to putting it up for a vote Thursday.</p> 
<p>Sens. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) proposed a two-year subsidy extension with new income caps and other eligibility restrictions — a plan that won some Democratic interest from Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 party leader.</p> 
<p><b>— The path ahead: </b>The Democratic proposal is likely to fail Thursday even though a handful of Republicans haven’t said yet how they will vote. Hawley, for instance, said Monday “everything is on the table.”</p> 
<p>But Thune is suggesting there will be further bipartisan negotiations afterward. There’s hope on both sides of the aisle that failure could spark new momentum as some lawmakers start eyeing Jan. 30, the next government funding deadline, as the real cutoff to land a health care deal.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— NDAA hits Rules: </b>The House plans to vote on the National Defense Authorization Act Wednesday afternoon — assuming it gets through the Rules Committee Tuesday evening. House Democrats could support the defense policy bill after House Armed Services ranking member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) signaled he’s on board. That means the biggest issue for Republicans likely won’t be final passage, but instead the rule vote Wednesday if some in the GOP choose to tank the party-line vote.</p> 
<p><b>— Digital trade legislation: </b>Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) is introducing a bipartisan bill Tuesday that would empower the president to negotiate and enforce digital trade agreements — but also give Congress the opportunity to review and block those agreements. The move signals potential renewed interest from Congress in addressing the taxation of digital goods.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Republicans have <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/gop-senators-circulate-health-care-plans-ahead-of-thursday-vote-00680645" target="_blank">no shortage of health care plans</a>. The challenge is getting all 53 of them to rally behind one.</p> 
<p>Three days before a high-profile vote on a Democratic proposal to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies, GOP senators are nowhere near coalescing behind any single alternative that could be put up alongside it. Instead, Republican leaders appear happy allowing their members to freelance, even as Democrats and some in their own ranks fume at the lack of clear direction.</p> 
<p>For Republicans, the risk of proceeding Thursday with a side-by-side vote is clear. While Democrats say they will have their entire 47-member caucus behind the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3385" target="_blank">three-year extension</a>, any GOP plan right now is likely to fall well short of complete unity — and highlight the divisions in their party.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> called the upcoming vote on Democrats’ plan “a political messaging exercise,” one he agreed to last month as part of a deal to end the 47-day government shutdown. He didn’t commit to putting up a GOP counteroffer for a vote.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think they’re serious about wanting to do a deal yet, so I think that may be what this week is about,” Thune told reporters Monday. “But we’ll see from there if there is a genuine interest in trying to do something.”</p> 
<p>GOP senators are expected to further discuss their options at a closed-door lunch Tuesday and make a final decision about their posture. But, according to three Republican aides granted anonymity to comment on internal conference dynamics, leaders are not currently expected to offer an alternative for a vote Thursday.</p> 
<p>One of the aides said Republicans will be prepared to make the case they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/06/obamacare-plans-schumer-trump-congress-00679712" target="_blank">have plenty of ideas</a> and are ready to talk with Democrats once they move off a proposal that won’t get the 60 votes needed to advance.</p> 
<p>But some Republicans want their leaders to put some concrete alternatives forward as more than 20 million Americans face the loss of enhanced Obamacare tax credits that were implemented as a Covid relief measure under President Joe Biden in 2021 and later extended through 2025. Without them, many families could see premiums rise by $1,000 a year or more.</p> 
<p>“What signal would that send if Republicans say, ‘Yeah, we’re going to say no to the Democrats’ plan, but we’re not going to offer anything?’” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307631" data-person-id="307631">Josh Hawley</a> (R-Mo.) said. “The message that will send is, good luck to the American people, and we don’t really care.”</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260075" data-person-id="260075">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.) said in an interview that simply standing aside while Democrats vote to extend the subsidies would be “a big mistake.”</p> 
<p>“A lot of my colleagues, I think, will be very upset if we don't put something up,” he said.</p> 
<p>But there are multiple competing proposals that are favored by subsets of the Senate GOP. Some of them include shorter extensions of the expiring subsidies. Others seek to replace them with new frameworks, generally involving giving Americans cash in the form of health savings accounts to help underwrite premiums and other costs.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/175586" data-person-id="175586">Rick Scott</a> (R-Fla.) is among those pushing for a clean break from the Affordable Care Act subsidy framework that reflects “what we believe in” as free-market-oriented Republicans. “I always think it's good to have an alternative,” he said in an interview.</p> 
<p>But Thune praised another <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_3386" target="_blank">proposal</a> being circulated by Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51173" data-person-id="51173">Mike Crapo</a> of Idaho and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66858" data-person-id="66858">Bill Cassidy</a> of Louisiana, who chair the health-oriented Finance and HELP committees, respectively.</p> 
<p>Their proposal, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/08/congress/cassidy-crapo-unveil-alternative-to-obamacare-subsidies-00682315" target="_blank">released Monday</a>, would expand the use of health savings accounts and direct funding toward them without extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>Cassidy said Monday that it is a “leadership decision” if his proposal gets a vote Thursday. Thune took steps Monday night to make the bill available for a vote later this week, as Republicans try to keep options on the table ahead of Tuesday’s lunch.</p> 
<p>But Thune also acknowledged some of his members have other ideas centered on extending the enhanced subsidies with a new income cap and other eligibility restrictions. Republican Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/398933" data-person-id="398933">Bernie Moreno</a> of Ohio and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51168" data-person-id="51168">Susan Collins</a> of Maine, for instance, propose to extend the expiring subsidies for two years with income cap restrictions and minimum premium payments.</p> 
<p>That proposal won some Democratic interest Monday from Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51180" data-person-id="51180">Dick Durbin</a> (D-Ill.), the No. 2 party leader, who called it “encouraging” and “in the ballpark” of a workable solution — though he cautioned he hadn’t seen the details.</p> 
<p>“It's not crazy,” Durbin said. “Let’s have a conversation.”</p> 
<p>The Senate GOP is straining to formulate a path forward as House Republicans race to come up with their own plan in hopes of putting some health care legislation up for a vote next week before lawmakers break for the holidays — and the enhanced subsidies expire, returning them to the original levels as passed in the 2010 Affordable Care Act.</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders still need to make key decisions, including if they try to assemble one bill or put up a suite of bills for members to pick and choose from. But they, too, are under pressure from a slice of members to embrace an extension of the subsidies — even as most in the party are happy to see them expire.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump hasn't put forward his own framework, which could have helped rally the disparate factions of his party on Capitol Hill. And Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> hammered Republicans Monday, saying that they “have no plan.”</p> 
<p>“The question Republicans face this week is very simple: Will they support our bill and lower people’s premiums or will they block our bill and send premiums through the roof?” Schumer said from the Senate floor Monday.</p> 
<p>While the Democratic proposal is expected to fall well short of the necessary 60 votes, a handful of Republicans haven’t said yet how they will vote. Hawley, for instance, said Monday “everything is on the table.”</p> 
<p>“What I’m not going to do is do nothing,” he said.</p> 
<p>It's likely Thursday’s vote won't be the last word on health care this Congress. Thune left the door open to further bipartisan negotiations, and there’s some hope on both sides of the aisle that a failed vote — or votes — could in fact lend new momentum to the talks. Lawmakers are increasingly eyeing Jan. 30, the next government funding deadline, as the real cutoff to land a health care deal.</p> 
<p>But getting to that point will require Democrats to compromise and Republicans to get together behind a plan of some kind. Asked Monday if his ranks were united or divided on health care, Thune acknowledged reality for a party that has struggled on the issue for decades.</p> 
<p>“I think we have people in different camps, as you would expect,” he said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Marc Veasey is set to drop his House bid in a Dallas-area seat and will instead run for Tarrant County judge, according to a person familiar with the situation granted anonymity.</p> 
<p>It’s the latest reshuffle brought on by the Texas GOP’s gerrymander, which could yield the party as many as five additional seats in next year’s midterms. Veasey’s north Texas district was redrawn to favor Republicans.</p> 
<p>Veasey had been expected to run for the seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/crockett-announces-texas-senate-bid-00680505" target="_blank"><u>launched her Senate campaign</u></a> on Monday after former Rep. Colin Allred dropped out of that race. Punchbowl News first reported Veasey’s decision.</p> 
<p>Allred’s decision to bow out of the Senate race and instead run for a seat in the House sets up yet another primary battle between the former NFL linebacker and Rep. Julie Johnson (D-Texas) in the state’s newly redrawn 33rd Congressional District. Johnson succeeded Allred after he left the House for his first Senate bid in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>GOP leaders unveiled <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20251208/RCP_xml[2].pdf" target="_blank">text of the 3,086-page bill</a> Sunday evening and are already facing public pushback from hard-line conservatives over the inclusion of Ukraine funding, the omission of a <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/20/congress/french-hill-at-odds-with-warren-scott-waters-over-ndaa-provisions-00663438" target="_blank">Federal Reserve digital currency ban</a> and other issues.</p> 
<p>While Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> can likely count on support from some Democrats on the final vote, he first must keep his own party together on a procedural vote expected earlier Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>To build unity, House GOP leaders are touting a variety of conservative wins in the final bill, including provisions taking aim at diversity and equity programs in the ranks. They also are declaring victory on measures that crack down on U.S. investment in China and repeal decades-old Middle East war powers authorizations.</p> 
<p>But some conservatives could be turned off by leaders’ decision to drop some social policy riders as well as the inclusion of language that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/07/compromise-defense-bill-trump-europe-troop-withdrawals-00680407" target="_blank">restricts Trump from significantly reducing</a> U.S. troop levels in Europe.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Gov. Ron DeSantis cast doubt Monday on the Trump administration’s ability to restrict states like Florida from regulating artificial intelligence, with new federal guidelines expected soon.</p> 
<p>DeSantis, a fierce AI skeptic, is pushing Florida to enact a slate of AI protections for residents during the upcoming legislative session and has the backing of state lawmakers, who are holding several hearings on the topic this week. But as President Donald Trump eyes a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/trump-says-ai-executive-order-limiting-state-rules-coming-this-week-00680557?utm_medium=bluesky&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">federal top-down AI “rulebook”</a> that could stymie Florida’s efforts, the GOP governor maintained it should be up to Congress, not the president, to establish such a sweeping policy. </p> 
<p>“An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action,” DeSantis posted on <a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1998101450442895531" target="_blank">social media</a> Monday. “Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation.”</p> 
<p>“The problem is that Congress hasn’t proposed any coherent regulatory scheme but instead just wanted to block states from doing anything for 10 years, which would be an AI amnesty," DeSantis continued. "I doubt Congress has the votes to pass this because it is so unpopular with the public." </p> 
<p>Trump’s hardline insistence on the federal government crafting AI regulations instead of states puts the president in a unique position with DeSantis, one of the loudest voices calling for states to take action. While the relationship between DeSantis and Trump has been strained at times, the governor has avoided direct criticism of the president and has largely been apprehensive of Congress proposing a lengthy moratorium blocking local AI laws.</p> 
<p>The president’s promise of an AI executive order coming down this week, though, could put a damper on possible moves sought by DeSantis and other state leaders.</p> 
<p>Florida lawmakers have introduced several bills to rein in AI, such as requiring insurance claim denials to come from a “qualified human,” and are likely to file more by the time session begins in January. DeSantis, for his part, wants a “bill of rights” stuffed with AI protections for consumers and residents, like preventing utility companies from up-charging residents when tech companies build massive data centers.</p> 
<p>With Trump’s AI action looming, state legislative leaders are currently taking a wait-and-see approach on how it could ultimately restrict them.</p> 
<p>“I haven't read the executive order, so I don't know,” state Senate President Ben Albritton (R-Wauchula) told reporters Monday. “I don't know the answer to the question, not until I see what it is specifically that the president comes out with and where that relates to what our authorities are.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY, New York — Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman is preparing to enter the race for New York governor as soon as Tuesday, according to two people with direct knowledge of his plans.</p> 
<p>Blakeman’s decision to seek the Republican nomination is a major snag in Rep. Elise Stefanik’s efforts to secure GOP backing in her challenge to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is running for a second full term next year.</p> 
<p>The looming primary has the makings of a battle royale between two ardent supporters of President Donald Trump — a generational fight pitting an ascendent woman in the Republican Party against a stalwart GOP officeholder who has been on the periphery of the Empire State’s political scene for decades.</p> 
<p>Blakeman, who last month won reelection in the suburbs east of New York City, has said Trump has not discouraged him from seeking statewide office. The president offered no preference Monday when reporters asked about Blakeman and Stefanik, appearing to signal that he doesn’t mind them competing.</p> 
<p>“He’s great and she’s great,” Trump said at the White House. “They’re both great people.”</p> 
<p>Hochul more overtly welcomed the competition.</p> 
<p>“If there’s a Republican primary, it makes it much more entertaining for me,” Hochul said about Blakeman’s launch. “Let them go at it. Let’s see how they out-MAGA each other.”</p> 
<p>Hochul has reason to be reassured. Republican Lee Zeldin competed in a four-candidate primary in 2022 and eventually came within 6 points of unseating her. Some New York Republicans grumble that Zeldin lost time he could have used to focus on Hochul and was drained of resources as a result.</p> 
<p>The people who spoke with POLITICO about Blakeman’s announcement were granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. A Blakeman spokesperson declined to comment on the pending launch.</p> 
<p>The county executive has downplayed the problems a primary would pose.</p> 
<p>“You gotta be sharp. You gotta be on your game if you want to win this,” he said when he was beginning to explore his bid. “There’s not a large margin of error for Republicans. So I think it sharpens both candidates if there is a primary in many circumstances as long as you can keep it from not degrading into namecalling and things of that nature, which I would never do.”</p> 
<p>Hochul, who faces her own primary challenge against Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, led Stefanik 52 percent to 27 percent in <a href="https://sri.siena.edu/2025/09/16/hochul-approval-favorability-ratings-up-a-little-favorability-best-since-jan-24-majority-hochul-works-hard-demonstrates-honesty-integrity-plurality-gets-things-done-provides-dec/?_gl=1*7cmts4*_ga*MjAyMDI4ODQzNC4xNzQ0MDYzODQ1*_ga_XN3VDZ9ZYZ*czE3NjUxNjQ1Mzkkbzg0JGcwJHQxNzY1MTY0NTM5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA.." target="_blank"><u>a Siena University poll last month</u></a>. In their bid to defeat the governor, Republicans plan to leverage New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s ascendance to City Hall — tying the moderate Hochul to the 34-year-old democratic socialist who is unpopular in the suburban counties.</p> 
<p>The suburbs will be key to Blakeman’s campaign.</p> 
<p>While he’s not well known statewide, the Nassau County executive hails from vote-rich Long Island, which has trended toward Republicans in recent elections. He identifies <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/11/19/gops-2026-abortion-conundrum-00658469" target="_blank"><u>as a “pro-choice Republican”</u></a> — a position that stands to complicate his ability to win over GOP voters in a closed party primary. Republicans, though, are hungry to win after being shut out of statewide office in New York for the last 20 years, and a less rigid stance on abortion rights may win over moderate voters.</p> 
<p>Blakeman is also a Trump-allied Republican <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/19/bruce-blakeman-trump-00169768" target="_blank"><u>who revels in culture wars</u></a> and has twice won a purple county where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. Nassau County is home to two critical House battlegrounds, and Republicans are eager to flip the seats held by Reps. Tom Suozzi and Laura Gillen in an effort to retain the majority in Washington.</p> 
<p>“Even before the election, a lot of community leaders, business leaders, political leaders asked me if I would get into the race because they feel that I would have the best chance to beat Kathy Hochul because of my attraction to crossover Democrats and independent voters,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/11/11/blakeman-tests-the-waters-00646111" target="_blank"><u>Blakeman said</u></a> last month after he won reelection.</p> 
<p>He has taken a conservative line on trans athletes, masking in public and is eager to have local law enforcement coordinate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.</p> 
<p>He also enjoys a warm relationship with The New York Post, the influential conservative tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch. Blakeman this year announced the Post would become the “official newspaper” of Nassau County.</p> 
<p>But Blakeman will face an immediate fundraising crunch. Stefanik, an aggressive fundraiser, formally entered the race for governor in November, but she has been effectively a candidate since the summer after Rep. Mike Lawler bowed out to run for reelection in his swing House seat. Stefanik has made early inroads with Republicans statewide, funding an effort to boost the party’s local-level candidates in the November elections.</p> 
<p>Trump likely will loom large in the race. Democrats are poised to tether the president to whoever emerges as the GOP nominee. And Trump’s May endorsement of Lawler’s House reelection bid almost certainly influenced the Hudson Valley Republican’s decision to forgo a gubernatorial run. If Trump decides to favor Stefanik or Blakeman, it is almost certain to have an impact on whether one or the other remains in the running.</p> 
<p>“I spoke to President Trump on election night. He congratulated me,” Blakeman said in November. “I told him I wanted to sit down and talk to him. And he said he was willing to sit down and talk about it. He didn’t discourage me.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings in early 2026 surrounding former special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into President Donald Trump — culminating in a hearing later in the year<b>&nbsp;</b>where Smith will testify in person before the panel.</p> 
<p>“Arctic Frost was a runaway train that swept up information from hundreds of innocent people simply because of their political affiliation,” Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said in a statement, shared first with POLITICO. “Congress and the American people want answers, and sunshine is the best disinfectant.”</p> 
<p>The Iowa Republican continued, “The Senate Judiciary Committee is leading this investigation to find out exactly what went wrong, so that bad actors can be held accountable and this sort of political witch hunt never happens again.”</p> 
<p>The announcement follows news that Smith requested Republican lawmakers’ phone records as part of his probe into Trump’s efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election. The revelations enraged GOP senators, who argued Smith’s investigation amounted to a weaponization of the Justice Department and have been clamoring for hearings.</p> 
<p>Four Senate Judiciary subcommittees are expected host hearings beginning in January focusing on how telecommunications companies responded to Smith’s subpoenas for lawmakers’ data; legal issues presented by those subpoenas; how judges handled non-disclosure orders for Smith’s subpoenas; and the use of government resources for the probe.</p> 
<p>Among those who could be chairing the subcommittee hearings will be Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who were among the senators singled out by Smith. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is another subcommittee chair expected to oversee a hearing who claims to have been subject to a subpoena.</p> 
<p>It’s not clear when Smith will testify before a full Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, but he is scheduled to testify across the Capitol next Wednesday behind closed doors to staff investigators with the House Judiciary Committee.</p> 
<p>House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is leading that effort, had his phone data requested by the Biden Justice Department prior to Smith joining the investigations into 2020 election interference and Trump's handling of classified documents.</p> 
<p>“Jack remains ready and willing to discuss his work as Special Counsel, and we're happy the American people will have the opportunity to hear directly from him about his investigation into President Trump’s alleged retention of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election," Peter Koski, an attorney for Smith, said in a statement Monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate is set to vote Thursday on whether to extend Obamacare health insurance subsidies that expire in 23 days. How Republicans will engage remains up in the air, as the party struggles more broadly to reach consensus on a range of “affordability” issues.</p> 
<p>Here’s where things stand heading into the big vote.</p> 
<p><b>The Senate GOP’s missing plan —</b> Senate Democrats are poised to get a vote on a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits — a bill that will likely fail. Republicans are leaning against holding a separate vote on their own alternative as they face internal divisions over what to put forward. The decision isn’t final, and some Republicans could try to advance proposals via unanimous consent.</p> 
<p><b>Mysterious House action — </b>Speaker Mike Johnson surprised a number of Republicans last Thursday when he <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/04/congress/johnson-house-gop-health-care-plan-00676661" target="_blank">said he planned to roll out a health care framework</a> in time to present to his conference by early this week. The House GOP strategy is expected to be a major topic of discussion during a retreat of committee staff directors and leadership staff that wraps tonight in Boston. The House Republican plan is likely to encompass bills that committees have been working on to boost health care options beyond the ACA — not an extension of Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p><b>The big picture on the GOP and affordability — </b>Republicans’ struggle over how to address the expiring ACA subsidies — a lapse that would raise health premiums for millions of Americans — is representative of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/republicans-affordability-congress-00679545" target="_blank">broader GOP floundering</a> over how to decisively respond to cost-of-living concerns ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>Beyond health care, the Trump administration’s proposal to distribute $2,000 rebate checks has gotten a lukewarm response on the Hill, and intraparty sparring has weighed on other smaller bills to address things like housing costs and student debt. Top Republicans acknowledge they haven’t done enough to sell the economic benefits of the “one big, beautiful bill,” and internal divisions threaten any attempt to follow up on it.</p> 
<p>Just this weekend, congressional leaders released a compromise version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act without housing legislation sought by Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and ranking member Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), after House Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-Ark.) and other key House Republicans objected.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump himself has recently called the emphasis on affordability a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats, even as 37 percent of those who voted for him last year say the cost of living in the U.S. is the worst they can remember it being, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747?orgid=756&amp;uniquet=vjmpEOsQvIeM0oJsD61kEg&amp;utm_att1=" target="_blank">a new POLITICO Poll</a>.</p> 
<p>“We haven’t probably messaged as effectively as we should,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview. “I think we’ll have lots of opportunities now that we’re getting into an election year to talk about the things we’ve done and how they are going to lead to things being more affordable for the American people, probably starting with tax relief next year.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— NDAA on track for House vote this week: </b>Compromise NDAA <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-fc11-d0a4-a1be-ffdd6f110000" target="_blank">text is out</a> and House GOP leaders are targeting a floor vote <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/07/compromise-defense-bill-trump-europe-troop-withdrawals-00680407" target="_blank">Thursday or Friday</a>. The first stop is a Rules Committee hearing, which could come as early as Tuesday.</p> 
<p><b>— Government funding action: </b>House GOP leaders are eyeing putting at least one appropriations bill if not two on the floor next week, right before they leave for the holiday recess. One senior House Republican says Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and other appropriators are expected to lean on leadership in the coming days.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans want to put the economy at the center of their midterm message as they seek to protect their majorities in Congress. But as cost-of-living concerns mount across the political spectrum, the GOP is struggling to act decisively to address them.</p> 
<p>Already top Republicans acknowledge they haven’t done enough to sell the “one big, beautiful bill,” the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/03/house-passes-gop-megabill-00438206" target="_blank">party-line centerpiece</a> of their economic agenda they enacted over the summer. Now internal divisions and the need for bipartisan support in the Senate are threatening any attempt to follow up on it.</p> 
<p>The GOP is struggling to coalesce behind a health care plan that would prevent Obamacare premium hikes set to kick in next month and efforts to rein in President Donald Trump’s tariffs have <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/15/congress/house-gop-to-extend-block-on-tariff-votes-00565091" target="_blank">run aground in the House</a>. Meanwhile, the administration’s proposal to distribute $2,000 rebate checks has gotten a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/13/republicans-in-congress-lukewarm-to-the-idea-of-tariff-rebate-checks-00650747" target="_blank">lukewarm response on Capitol Hill</a> and the fate of other smaller bills to address things like housing prices and student debt have sparked intraparty sparring.</p> 
<p>“The cost of living is a legitimate issue — I think it was one of the main reasons President Trump was elected. I think it’s still an issue,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260075" data-person-id="260075">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.) said in an interview, urging Republicans to pursue another party-line bill before the midterms in response.</p> 
<p>While many in the GOP — including Trump — continue to lay blame for their economic problems with former President Joe Biden, there are clear warning signs for Republicans. Forty-six percent of respondents in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747" target="_blank">recent POLITICO Poll</a> said the cost of living is the worst they can remember it being.</p> 
<p>That includes 37 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2024, and about a quarter of Trump voters say he is either fully or mainly responsible for the current state of the economy.</p> 
<p>Yet top GOP leaders in Congress are keeping expectations low for major new economic legislation. Instead, they are betting on having an easier time addressing affordability questions next month, when new programs enacted as part of the megabill start impacting voters — like no taxes on some tips and overtime income.</p> 
<p>“We haven’t probably messaged as effectively as we should,” Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> said in an interview, when asked about the party’s economic case. “I think we’ll have lots of opportunities now that we’re getting into an election year to talk about the things we’ve done and how they are going to lead to things being more affordable for the American people, probably starting with tax relief next year.”</p> 
<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> also argued voters have not fully felt the impact of the megabill “because it takes a while for it to be implemented.” But he predicted that by mid-2026, “there’s going to be boats rising in the economy, this is going to be a very different situation before we go into the election cycle.”</p> 
<p>“Republicans are dialed in like a laser, with laser focus on the cost of living and affordability,” he added, while forecasting more to come: “They are going to see this agenda going forward — our affordability agenda.”</p> 
<p>But there are reasons to doubt an impending turnaround. Some of these same leaders argued this summer, as they strained to pass the megabill, that Americans would feel the economic benefits in a big way by late fall. That never materialized, with Republicans instead bogged down in a monthslong fight over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein and a lengthy government shutdown. Trump himself has recently taken to calling the emphasis on affordability a “hoax” <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2025/11/14/trump-plays-the-blame-game-on-epstein-affordability-00652024" target="_blank">perpetrated by Democrats</a>.</p> 
<p>Democrats are gearing up to hammer the GOP on the issue, and some of them are hearing some familiar echoes in the promises of a rapid turnaround just around the corner. Democrats said much the same thing after their party passed their own major party-line bills as inflation rose under Biden.</p> 
<p>“They are in a bubble from Donald Trump on down,” Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> told reporters last week. “Donald Trump says there’s no affordability crisis — what kind of world is he living in?”</p> 
<p>Kennedy isn’t the only one talking up the idea of doing a second party-line bill using the budget reconciliation process to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The Republican Study Committee, a large bloc of House conservatives, is pushing such a bill aimed at addressing affordability and other issues, and Senate Budget Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51186" data-person-id="51186">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) is vowing to plow forward in laying the groundwork for another reconciliation measure.</p> 
<p>But Johnson and Thune have treaded lightly on the prospects for second such bill, which <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/trump-congress-agenda-reconciliation-00658591" target="_blank">faces uphill odds</a> with the GOP divided on the policy particulars and the midterms drawing closer by the day. Instead attention is being drawn to smaller-bore efforts.</p> 
<p>Tony Fabrizio, a top Trump pollster, also urged <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/tony-fabrizio-health-drug-prices-00674841" target="_blank">members of the RSC last week</a> to tackle high prices for prescription drugs and housing — warning members in a closed-door meeting that affordability concerns were a key reason a House special election in Tennessee was so close.</p> 
<p>But even a push to attach a bipartisan housing package to the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_3838" target="_blank">annual defense policy bill</a> sparked an intraparty turf war, pitting Senate Banking Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151800" data-person-id="151800">Tim Scott</a> (R-S.C.) and Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/140963" data-person-id="140963">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.), the panel’s ranking member, against House Financial Services Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227472" data-person-id="227472">French Hill</a> (R-Ark.).</p> 
<p>Scott said in an interview last week the housing measure is “a great sign that we are looking for ways to address the challenges that we see in real America” and that passing it now would put lawmakers “on the same page as President Trump and the White House.”</p> 
<p>But Hill, who plans to advance a separate housing package through his committee later this month, told senators that parts of the Senate bill are unacceptable to most House Republicans and need to be left out of the Pentagon bill.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196030" data-person-id="196030">Mike Flood</a> (R-Neb.), who is spearheading the House package, said last week he would be “amenable to something that has provisions the House wants and the Senate wants.” Thune, asked if the Senate housing provision would get in the defense bill, crossed his fingers.</p> 
<p>But no agreement could be reached over the weekend, and the House released defense bill text Sunday night that did not include the housing provisions.</p> 
<p>Other lawmakers are itching to show that the party is addressing other affordability concerns, even if those efforts face an uncertain path to becoming law. </p> 
<p>House GOP leaders, for instance, are trying to move long-delayed permitting reform legislation over the floor in the coming weeks, arguing that reducing red tape for energy and other projects would lower the cost of living. And Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/364729" data-person-id="364729">Anna Paulina Luna</a> (R-Fla.) told reporters Thursday there could soon be a bipartisan effort to force a <a href="https://moskowitz.house.gov/posts/federal-student-loan-interest-rates" target="_blank">bill capping student loan interest</a> at 2 percent to the House floor.</p> 
<p>“That’s a hint for next week,” she said, when asked if she or a colleague would pursue a discharge petition aimed at sidestepping House GOP leaders who have opposed other forms of student loan relief.</p> 
<p>House and Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are having a furious behind-the-scenes debate about how to show they are trying to address health care costs ahead of the end-of-year expiration of Obamacare subsidies used by more than 20 million Americans.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151837" data-person-id="151837">John Hoeven</a> (R-N.D.) acknowledged “there’s a lot more to do” on affordability beyond this year’s megabill on health care and more: “Obviously, medical inflation is very high.”</p> 
<p>But GOP leaders in both chambers are scrambling to figure out what pieces of a health care overhaul to put forward — and getting an earful from competing factions within their own party. It’s possible Senate Republicans this week won’t put a consensus GOP alternative up for a vote alongside the three-year extension Democrats want.</p> 
<p>A plethora of rank-and-file options are under development, with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) backing a two-year extension of the subsidies with new eligibility restrictions, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wanting to provide more flexibility for health savings accounts and Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307631" data-person-id="307631">Josh Hawley</a> (R-Mo.) proposing to make it <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/hawley-pitches-new-health-care-tax-plan-00674123" target="_blank">easier to deduct medical expenses</a> on their income taxes.</p> 
<p>“It’s a disaster,” Hawley said. “Health care, as it currently is, is too expensive for everybody.”</p>
