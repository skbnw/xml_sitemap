      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats, election experts and even some members of the Trump administration expressed alarm and bewilderment about why Tulsi Gabbard was on the scene as the FBI raided a Georgia election office that has been at the center of Donald Trump’s debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen.</p> 
<p>Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, <a href="https://x.com/corinne_perkins/status/2016673423708053509" target="_blank">was photographed late Wednesday</a> outside the Fulton County elections office near Atlanta, Georgia, as the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249" target="_blank">FBI executed a search warrant</a> to seize ballots and other records related to the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>As DNI, Gabbard has no domestic law enforcement authority and is not typically involved in criminal investigations, a reality that alarmed many Democrats on Capitol Hill — and even puzzled some Trump officials. </p> 
<p>“My constituents in Georgia and I think much of the American public are quite reasonably alarmed in asking questions after the director of national intelligence was spotted bizarrely and personally lurking in an FBI evidence truck in Fulton County, Georgia, yesterday,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/34364" data-person-id="34364">Jon Ossoff</a> (D-Ga.) said during an unrelated Senate hearing Thursday morning.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/spy-chief-tulsi-gabbard-is-hunting-for-2020-election-fraud-07ea2383?mod=hp_lead_pos3" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday</a> that Gabbard was investigating the 2020 election, and has regularly briefed Trump and other administration officials about her search. “President Trump and his entire team are committed to ensuring a U.S. election can never, ever be rigged again. Director Gabbard is playing a key lead role in this important effort,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told The Journal.</p> 
<p>Olivia Coleman, a spokesperson for Gabbard, confirmed the DNI was on the scene in Atlanta. She did not immediately respond to follow-up inquiries about her reported probe of the 2020 vote.</p> 
<p>Despite concerns raised by Democrats, Gabbard appears to be taking on a more expansive public role in American elections. On Thursday, White House aide Jared Borg told a group of election officials that Gabbard — alongside Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi — is set to address the winter meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State on Friday.</p> 
<p>Trump has long fixated on unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in Georgia in the aftermath of the 2020 election, which he lost to former President Joe Biden. He has continued to falsely suggest that the election was stolen since returning to the White House, including in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. </p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Davis Ingle defended Gabbard in an emailed statement. “Director Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases and election infrastructure,” he wrote. “She has and will continue to take action on President Trump’s directive to secure our elections and work with our interagency partners to do so.”</p> 
<p>Trump spent much of the morning amplifying claims that the Georgia vote was rigged on Truth Social, and <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115978031218105674" target="_blank">even called attention to Gabbard’s role</a> in Wednesday’s raid. </p> 
<p>Gabbard’s role remains confusing to some in the administration. Two current Justice Department officials and one Trump administration official said they were also puzzled by Gabbard’s presence in Fulton County. “It remains a mystery to me why she would need to be there,” said the administration official, who, like others interviewed, was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. </p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66837" data-person-id="66837">Mark Warner</a>, (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, <a href="https://x.com/MarkWarner/status/2016722913420845333" target="_blank">argued on X Wednesday</a> that there “are only two explanations” for Gabbard’s presence in the raid.</p> 
<p>“Either Director Gabbard believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus — in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed’ of relevant national security concerns — or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for the office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” he wrote.</p> 
<p>Warner and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/himes-warner_letter_to_dni_1.29.2026_.pdf" target="_blank">wrote to Gabbard Thursday</a> to request briefings for both panels about the legal basis, scope, and justification of her participation in the raid.</p> 
<p>Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189610" data-person-id="189610">Alex Padilla</a> (D-Calif.), who before entering Congress was California’s chief election official, told a panel at NASS on Thursday that Gabbard’s presence at the raid should be a reminder about “the urgency of the situation.”</p> 
<p>“I guess they’re still searching for 11,000 more votes,” he quipped, referencing a call Trump had with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after losing the 2020 election. “But it should be a reminder — or a wake up — that this can happen at any point once again between now and this coming November.”</p> 
<p>Gabbard’s appearance at the raid led some Democrats to believe she wanted to be there to claim credit for it publicly.</p> 
<p>“When the head of a department participates in something, it's about PR, not about process and the law,” Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51223" data-person-id="51223">Jack Reed</a> (D-R.I.) told POLITICO. “If they have evidence, they want evidence and they have a valid warrant, and you let the professionals go in and do that.”</p> 
<p>While Gabbard has veered in and out of the good graces of Trump during her tenure as DNI, she appeared to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/23/gabbard-once-scorned-takes-center-stage-with-latest-obama-allegations-00471183" target="_blank">hit a high point last summer</a> when she alleged that senior U.S. intelligence officials under then-President Barack Obama were guilty of treason because they had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/18/tulsi-gabbard-2016-election-investigation-00463779" target="_blank">fabricated intelligence about Russian meddling in the 2016 election</a>.</p> 
<p>Trump said last week that individuals who played a role in that year’s vote <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/trump-2020-election-prosecutions-00738778?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack" target="_blank">will soon be prosecuted</a>.</p> 
<p>David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told reporters on Thursday that Gabbard’s Georgia appearance only sparks more concerns that the raid “is an attempt to fuel false claims and disinformation.”</p> 
<p>“There is no reason for the director of national intelligence to be in any kind of voting site,” he said. “She has neither the authority nor the competence to assess anything in that voting site. And so it’s incredibly troubling to see something like that.”</p> 
<p>Mo Ivory, a Fulton County commissioner, said Thursday that federal officials took 700 boxes of ballots and “ancillary” materials from the 2020 election. The county’s attorney, she said, is “working with a group of local and national lawyers" to formulate a legal response.</p> 
<p>The first DOJ official said the ballots are now being stored at an FBI facility in Winchester, Virginia.</p> 
<p>Spokespeople for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not respond to requests for comment. In 2020, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/24/raffensperger-georgia-election-misinformation-00137372" target="_blank">Raffensperger famously rebuffed</a> Trump’s pressure campaign to “find” enough votes to flip the state’s election for him.</p> 
<p>The two DOJ officials said the FBI received a heads up that Gabbard would be on site for the raid. They said her participation did not bother FBI Director Kash Patel or other bureau officials.</p> 
<p>Democrats, however, worry more broadly that the raid could have a chilling effect on future elections.</p> 
<p>“The facts are clear, Trump lost, and he has to accept that and move on with his life,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in an interview. “And everyone in his administration should do the same, instead of terrorizing election officials and interfering with our work to simply just prepare for the midterm elections.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Thursday declined to say whether he would support Sen. John Fetterman if he runs for reelection in 2028, the latest twist in a fraught relationship between Pennnsylvania’s two most prominent Democrats.</p> 
<p>“John will decide if he’s going to run for reelection. I appreciate his service,” Shapiro said before quickly pivoting, when asked whether Fetterman is “someone that you admire and would support for reelection” at a Christian Science Monitor press event in Washington.</p> 
<p>Asked point-blank whether he liked Fetterman, Shapiro replied: “Of course. And we all work together to do good things for the people of Pennsylvania.”</p> 
<p>Fetterman has not yet said whether he will seek reelection in 2028. But progressives are already <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/politics/2025/11/working-families-party-pledges-support-john-fetterman-primary-challenger/409595/" target="_blank"><u>plotting a primary challenge</u></a> to him over his centrist congressional voting record that’s seen him cross party lines to support some of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks, give full-throated support for Israel and repeatedly buck Democrats during shutdown fights.</p> 
<p>The relationship between the top Pennsylvania Democrats and stylistic opposites has long been strained, though Fetterman has been much more public about his disdain for Shapiro than the other direction.</p> 
<p>Fetterman, in his 2025 memoir, criticized Shapiro for acting out of “political ambition” and <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/12/us-news/sen-john-fetterman-raged-at-fing-ahole-josh-shapiro-reveals-why-their-relationship-never-recovered-in-new-memoir/" target="_blank"><u>wrote that he was caught on a hot mic</u></a> calling Shapiro a “fucking asshole” during a Zoom meeting while serving together on the state’s pardon board. Fetterman wrote he wished Shapiro the best — but claimed the two “no longer speak.”</p> 
<p>Shapiro refuted that Thursday, saying “yes” the two are on speaking terms, adding that they were in a meeting together with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy “a few weeks ago … working on an important issue in Pennsylvania.”</p> 
<p>Shapiro makes just two mentions of Fetterman in his own memoir, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” which was released this week — both just passing mentions of the two being at the same political events. He notes the two spoke backstage at an Erie Democratic dinner days before Fetterman’s stroke.</p> 
<p>A representative for Fetterman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>State election officials were among the most visible defenders of American democracy after the 2020 election — standing up to President Donald Trump, rejecting false claims and, whether they wanted to or not, becoming national symbols of institutional resistance to his attempts to overturn his election loss.</p> 
<p>But as some run for governor in 2026, they are eager to talk about anything but 2020.</p> 
<p>More than five years after Trump’s attempt to cling to power ignited a political rallying cry on the left and a loyalty test on the right, these Republican and Democratic candidates are betting — and, in some cases, hoping — that voters have moved on.</p> 
<p>A pair of Republican secretaries of state who rejected Trump’s false 2020 election claims and then survived MAGA-fueled 2022 primaries are running for governor. Unsurprisingly, neither is keen to relitigate the issue that linger over their hopes this year.</p> 
<p>“2020 is very far behind us as secretaries of state,” Kansas Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab said. “We remember it, but we’re moving on, and I think the American public is too.”</p> 
<p>But Trump isn’t ready to move on, complicating these candidates’ hopes of putting 2020 in the rearview mirror. Speaking before an audience of global leaders and business officials in Davos last week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/trump-2020-election-prosecutions-00738778" target="_blank">Trump repeated his false claim</a> that the 2020 election was “rigged” and promised that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did.”</p> 
<p>Two Democratic secretaries of state are also running for the governor’s mansion. And while defending democracy and their defiance to Trump on election issues forms a defining part of their political biographies, both candidates lead with pocketbook issues rather than making protecting the vote the centerpiece.</p> 
<p>“This election is about Michigan, and this election is about who is best positioned to lower costs for the people in our state,” Michigan Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>In many ways, the shift reflects the reality of running for the governor’s mansion. The job description is much broader from the office of the secretary of state — and voters want to hear about what politicians will do for them now.</p> 
<p>But it also underscores the political evolution of one of the most animating aspects of Trump’s first term.</p> 
<p>For Democrats, democracy was a potent force in 2022, when candidates <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/24/election-deniers-secretary-of-state-00062383" target="_blank">leaned heavily into running against election deniers</a>. And many Democrats say it’s still effective.</p> 
<p>“They use the issue as an illustration of character,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. “It really communicates integrity, nonpartisanship, commitment to democracy and freedom, standing up for people, and courage.”</p> 
<p>As Democratic candidates’ use of democracy messaging has evolved, strategists say the meaning of “democracy” itself has also shifted since 2020. Then, it was largely about election integrity and the transfer of power. Now, it’s increasingly tied to broader concerns about executive authority, with Democrats arguing they’ll be the ones who can stand up to a president they see as authoritarian.</p> 
<p>“This is the moment where you need a governor who won't bend the knee,” said Benson, who has been outspoken against the Trump administration following back-to-back killings of protestors in Minnesota by federal agents.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/84/77/62a964ca48f79cf2c7810d4e0afe/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2170653219" alt="Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson speaks during a House Administration Committee hearing on " data-portal-copyright="Bonnie Cash/Getty Images" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="2170653219" data-licensor-name="Getty Images" data-title="Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson speaks during a House Administration Committee hearing on "/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Jocelyn Benson</h4> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium"></h5> 
<p>Benson was on the front lines of defending her state’s election results after 2020, facing threats and swatting attacks. That period is a part of her messaging: Her campaign launch video showed news footage of her home being surrounded by protesters, and she remains <a href="https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-2020-election-pardons-michigan-interference-rcna244664" target="_blank">outspoken</a> against false claims related to the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>She has also cast that moment as proof of leadership — and a willingness to stand up to Trump. “We fought back to protect democracy itself and we showed that as state officials, that's how we have to respond to bullies who try to rip away our rights no matter how powerful they may be,” she said.</p> 
<p>But on the campaign trail, Benson has often focused more on bread-and-butter economic issues. Affordability, housing, health care, childcare and energy costs are listed as her top issues on her campaign website.</p> 
<p>“What every resident, every citizen, every voter in this election knows is how important it is to have a governor who will fight for them and who will fight for them in a way that that effectively lowers their cost of living while also protecting the safety of themselves, their families and their communities,” Benson told POLITICO.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/d0/aa/2429e0244afcb5791a7831a19da2/election-2020-georgia-48074.jpg" alt="Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger speaks during a news conference in Atlanta, on Nov. 11, 2020, after state election officials announced an audit of the presidential election results." data-portal-copyright="Brynn Anderson/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="20316602548074" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger speaks during a news conference in Atlanta, on Nov. 11, 2020, after state election officials announced an audit of the presidential election results."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Brad Raffensperger</h4> 
<p>Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was one of the most prominent Republicans to reject Trump after the president urged him to “find” more votes in his state. The incident propelled him into the national spotlight — and drew <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/28/georgia-secretary-of-state-gop-478251" target="_blank">fury from the president and his MAGA base</a>, leading to death threats. He warded off a Trump-endorsed primary challenge in 2022, in part by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/24/raffensperger-georgia-reelection-conservative-media-00011224" target="_blank">taking his case</a> to conservative media. Now, he’s seeking the governor’s mansion in the state that is in many ways the epicenter of Trump’s bid to hold on to power in 2020.</p> 
<p>Raffensperger does not directly talk about the 2020 incident in his launch video or on his campaign website. Instead, he frames his record as evidence that he is willing to make the "tough decisions.” His launch video focuses on creating jobs in Georgia, lowering property taxes and banning transgender women from women sports, among other issues — issues that are key to voters but not central to his current day job.</p> 
<p>But Georgia’s 2020 election keeps getting pushed back into the spotlight.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249" target="_blank">FBI executed a search warrant</a> at the Fulton County elections office outside Atlanta, seizing all ballots from the 2020 election there.</p> 
<p>“He’s trying to talk about other issues, [but] 2020 keeps coming up,” said Buzz Brockway, a former Republican state legislator who lost to Raffensperger in a 2018 primary.</p> 
<p>Brockway said many Republicans have moved on from 2020 — but that there remains a “loud, noisy contingent who are continuing that battle” that Raffensperger will have to contend with, even if most voters’ main focus lies elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Raffensperger has largely sidestepped questions about the 2020 election — in a November <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/politically-georgia-live-brad-raffensperger-on-passing-the-2020-test/" target="_blank">interview with the Atlanta-Journal Constitution</a>, he said that it showed that he does the “right thing, no matter what.”</p> 
<p>“Other people haven’t been put to that test, but we were at the end of the day," he said.</p> 
<p>Raffensperger’s campaign declined to comment for this story.</p> 
<p>Still, Raffensperger’ opponents in the GOP primary, particularly Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, are eager to keep 2020 alive in the race. Jones, who was a fake elector in the state, has tried to cast his actions during that period as unflinching loyalty to the president.</p>

<p>In ruby-red Kansas, Schwab defied some of the loudest voices in his party when he repeatedly rejected false claims about the 2020 election in his role as secretary of state. He has been clear that he does not see that chapter as central to his gubernatorial bid as he runs in a crowded GOP primary.</p> 
<p>“Everybody’s concerned about taxes, especially with cost of living,” Schwab, a past <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/16/nass-secretaries-state-election-bipartisanship-00141840" target="_blank">chair of the National Association of Secretaries of State</a>, said in an interview. “Property taxes are a real red-hot button in Kansas.”</p> 
<p>His campaign launch video only briefly mentions election issues, and almost as an afterthought. “As secretary of state, I streamlined business services and cut bureaucratic red tape,” he said. “I secured our elections, too.”</p> 
<p>There remains a segment of the GOP for whom election issues remain salient, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Kansas. But for the broader electorate — those most likely to turn out in midterm elections — these issues are still “pretty low down the list.”</p> 
<p>In 2022, Schwab, Raffensperger and Benson all prevailed in their reelections, despite facing Trump-backed challengers or outright election deniers.</p> 
<p>“I would say that most people really believe that we've moved on,” Schwab said.</p><img src="https://static.politico.com/47/81/7b03ade04febac7b9570f38bb14e/trump-elections-commission-46277.jpg" alt="Main Secretary of State Shenna Bellows speaks at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board in-person public meeting in Charlotte North Carolina in April 2025." data-portal-copyright="Chris Carlson/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="25114535946277" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Main Secretary of State Shenna Bellows speaks at the U.S. Election Assistance Commission Standards Board in-person public meeting in Charlotte North Carolina in April 2025."/><h4 class="story-text__heading-large is-centered">Shenna Bellows</h4> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium"></h5> 
<p>Democrat Secretary of State Shenna Bellows became Maine secretary of state in January 2021 after being chosen by the state legislature, just as Trump was in the middle of his push to overturn his election loss. In 2023, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/29/shenna-bellows-maine-trump-ballot-00133332" target="_blank">she ruled that Trump</a> should be barred from the ballot for his conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court.</p> 
<p>In the blue-leaning state, and facing a crowded primary, Bellows has been more eager to talk about the issue than some of her fellow chief election officials.</p> 
<p>“Leadership is about doing what is right, even when it is hard,” she said in her launch video, which highlighted the threats and harassment she faced as a result of her decision.</p> 
<p>In her bid for governor, she has emphasized that anger over Trump’s actions exists in tandem with persistent anxiety about the economy. Like Benson, she has been vocal in criticizing the killings in Minnesota.</p> 
<p>“The economy is the number one issue for most Mainers, there's a lot of economic concern right now, especially in the wake of the tariffs and increasing job losses that we're about to see,” she told POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“That being said, I also think it's really important to tell the truth,” she said. “What the Trump decision and my work as secretary and defending democracy tells people about me is that I will do the right thing even when it's hard.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Republicans have had some reliable <i>terra firma:</i> If they were talking about immigration and border security, they were winning.</p> 
<p>Even amid the backlash from Donald Trump’s 2016 pledge to ban all Muslim immigrants to his 2024 amplification of baseless claims that migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets—immigration remained a durable, winning issue for the GOP.</p> 
<p>Now the ground is shifting under them.</p> 
<p>A torrent of viral images from Minnesota and beyond as Trump’s immigration agents stepped up their shambolic interior campaign of enforcement in recent months — and the killing of two people in Minneapolis in two separate incidents this past month — have led to a loud public backlash, soured voters on the GOP’s approach and eroded President Donald Trump’s standing on the issue ahead of the looming midterms.</p> 
<p>The broad sweep of public polling shows Trump fumbling what has historically been his party’s strongest issue, which even Democrats concede paved his path back to the White House. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-approval-drops-record-low-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-26/" target="_blank">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> found this week Trump hit a second-term trough on the issue, with a majority of Americans — 58 percent — saying his crackdown has gone too far. Only 39 percent approve of his handling of immigration, down two points from earlier this month, and an 11-point erosion from last February. What’s more, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/ice-polling-memo-searchlight-00751569" target="_blank">a poll</a> from the Democratic-aligned Searchlight Institute this week found that 58 percent of likely midterm voters want ICE to be reined in.</p> 
<p>"The image that has been created is not a good thing," said Jose Arango, the Republican chair of Hudson County, New Jersey, a heavily Democratic area with a large Hispanic population that shifted rightward in 2024. "We're losing in the public relations campaign."</p> 
<p>Even before Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis, Trump’s own voters were fretting over his agenda. A plurality of Americans said the president’s mass deportation campaign is too aggressive — including 1 in 5 voters who backed Trump in 2024, according to the latest <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668" target="_blank">POLITICO Poll</a>. More than 1 in 3 Trump voters said that while they support his immigration agenda, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.</p> 
<p>And <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-0762-d9a8-a7be-87e22d550000" target="_blank">another new round of polling</a> on Thursday could give Democrats more ammo as voters move away from Trump’s immigration agenda. The Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC’s latest polling, shared exclusively with POLITICO and being sent to lawmakers, donors and campaigns Thursday, shows not only a growing number of likely voters who disapprove of ICE, but also a majority in favor of Democrats’ strategy of demands for reform <i>even if</i> it means a partial government shutdown, with 54 percent also saying they would blame the GOP and Trump for the shutdown and not accepting ICE reforms. These numbers are especially telling as the biggest shifts occur “among moderates, non-MAGA Republicans, and key swing voters,” the polling memo said.</p> 
<p>As former President Joe Biden and his administration officials left themselves electorally exposed on the issue, then-candidate Donald Trump exploited those vulnerabilities with vows to seal the southern border and enact the largest deportation campaign in American history. But his enforcement actions have focused less on the border, which polls show most voters approve of, and more on the nation’s interior, drawing the ire of Trump-curious commentators like the comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan and raising alarm among Republicans.</p> 
<p>“The president can feel, generally, that his policies at the border have been largely supported by a majority of Americans. But what he’s doing inside the border seems to be not working,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/republican-mayors-trump-ice-00754195" target="_blank">said Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt</a>, a Republican who runs one of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2014/08/08/chart-of-the-week-the-most-liberal-and-conservative-big-cities/" target="_blank">most conservative large cities in the nation</a> but backed Kamala Harris in 2024.</p> 
<p>One longtime Republican strategist who worked on presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2024, granted anonymity to candidly assess Republicans’ standing, expressed consternation over ICE’s deployment to a place like Minnesota, far from the southern border.</p> 
<p>“When I think of immigrants broadly, I don’t think of Minnesota,” the strategist said. “People want to see, like, okay, ‘I voted for taking criminal illegal immigrants and getting them out of the country. I want to see criminal illegal immigrants taken out of the country. I want to see more miles of wall being built.’ I feel like we talked about the wall weekly in Trump 1. I don't remember the last time we talked about the wall in Trump 2.”</p> 
<p>All of which raises an uncomfortable question for Republicans: Is the party in danger of ceding one of its best issues back to Democrats?</p> 
<p>“Immigration used to be a winning issue for Democrats back when we made clear we took enforcement seriously,” said Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) and top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who commissioned the Searchlight polling shared with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as he shuttled toward another potential shutdown over the issue. “It can be a winning issue for us again if we are smart about how we handle this.</p> 
<p>Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a rising Democratic star who won his seat in 2024 at the same time Trump carried his state, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ruben-gallego-democrats-latino-senator-ab9b48c24fcdbc4eb54bcddc48a82a66" target="_blank">campaigned in key Latino areas</a> for his party in New Jersey, Virginia and Miami’s mayoral elections last year, and who has launched his own <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/ruben-gallego-immigration-border-security-plan-00341242" target="_blank">border security and immigration platform</a>, told POLITICO his party has to build trust with swing voters.</p> 
<p>“We have to be the party that talks about professional, legal enforcement of our immigration laws with an understanding that criminals need to be deported and the border needs to be secure, and that we have to move to a sane compromise when it comes to immigration reform,” Gallego said.</p> 
<p>It wasn’t so long ago that was the reality: As recently as 2013, under then-President Barack Obama, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2013/07/poll-democrats-winning-on-immigration-024052" target="_blank">the majority of Americans</a> said the Democratic Party better represents their feelings on immigration than Republicans did.</p> 
<p>What does the GOP risk ahead of the midterms if it doesn’t find a better message?</p> 
<p>“I think you'll see the numbers continue to suffer,” the longtime GOP strategist said.</p> 
<p>Gallego, who has called for White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller to be fired, said that gives Democrats an opportunity.</p> 
<p>“If I was the Republicans right now, I would be very worried about what the future looks like in terms of elections, and Stephen Miller may have basically created a political tsunami among voters, both Latino voters as well as just kind of moderate voters,” Gallego said. “That's going to come back and haunt them, going into the 2026 election.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A number of Republican mayors are condemning the Trump administration’s hardline immigration enforcement tactics in Minnesota, as they call on the president to pull back from Minneapolis and worry their cities might be next.</p> 
<p>“It’s roiling the country,” Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told POLITICO. “We're all sort of feeling the angst of our residents and the fear that our city will be next and that chaos is going to inevitably creep across the entire country.”</p> 
<p>Fresno, California, Mayor Jerry Dyer said in an interview that “too much damage has been done” with the crackdown and “the trust in communities has been lost.”</p> 
<p>And Burnsville, Minnesota, Mayor Elizabeth Kautz, warned that the agency’s current tactics meant “our cities are no longer safe.”</p> 
<p>The remarks from the trio of moderate-leaning GOP mayors who have broken with Trump in the past came at the annual gathering of the nonpartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors, held blocks from the White House. Holt chairs the conference.</p> 
<p>The Republican leaders’ calls for Trump to deescalate after the fatal shootings of two Minnesotans by federal agents show the GOP’s deepening fissures over the administration’s aggressive immigration agenda, even as the mayors and Republicans broadly offered support for the president’s overall goal. And their alarm comes as ICE ramps up operations in other states, including Arizona and Maine.</p> 
<p>The escalating immigration enforcement crackdown hung over the annual gathering, dominating conversations among leaders who are scrambling to prepare their cities for ICE sweeps and allay anxious and outraged residents.</p> 
<p>Dyer on Wednesday said federal agents need to receive more training in deescalation tactics — a practice that the Fresno mayor, who served in law enforcement for 40 years, including 18 as the city's police chief, said is integral for local police departments. He also said federal agencies should only work in communities where they have the cooperation of local leaders.</p> 
<p>“I don't believe that agencies should be deployed into cities against the will of local government and without the cooperation of local law enforcement,” Dyer said. “That’s a recipe for disaster, and I believe that's somewhat of what we're seeing today.”</p> 
<p>And he urged other Republicans to speak out against federal immigration agents’ recent tactics.</p> 
<p>“The Republican Party in general cannot rubber-stamp everything a party does or this administration does,” Dyer said. “Too many people today are turning a blind eye when they should be speaking out in opposition.”</p> 
<p>It wasn’t just big-city GOP mayors who were concerned with the administration’s response: Kautz’s town of 64,000 people is in Minneapolis’ south suburbs.</p> 
<p>Kautz, who said she now carries her passport in public, called for ICE to use judicial warrants, arguing that while violent criminals need to be off the street, it needs to be done “through proper channels, the rule of law, due process [and rooted] in the Constitution.” In Minnesota, “that is not our experience.”</p> 
<p>A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668" target="_blank">new POLITICO poll</a> found that more than 1 in 3 Trump voters said that while they support the goals of his immigration agenda, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.</p> 
<p>Holt, who runs one of the most conservative large cities in the U.S. but backed Kamala Harris over Trump in 2024, warned that Trump’s interior enforcement was a failure.</p> 
<p>“The president can feel, generally, that his policies at the border have been largely supported by a majority of Americans,” Holt said. “But what he's doing inside the border seems to be not working.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats could face a gloomy Electoral College atmosphere next decade, according to new population estimates released Tuesday that show red-leaning states like Texas and Florida making major gains and California as a big loser.</p> 
<p>By combining <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2026/population-growth-slows.html" target="_blank">the census bureau’s new state population estimates</a> for 2025 with previous years’ data, experts quickly projected the number of House seats — and Electoral College votes — states will gain or lose after the 2030 Census in the process known as reapportionment. And while those projections differ slightly, they all had bad news for Democrats: GOP-leaning states will gain electoral power and Democratic-leaning states will lose it if the trends continue.</p> 
<p>While Joe Biden would still have won in 2020 under the estimates, two projected maps show Democrats would no longer be able to win the Electoral College by relying solely on the Rust Belt battleground states.</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/RedistrictNet/status/2016161865550659995" target="_blank">One of the estimates from Jonathan Cervas</a>, a redistricting and apportionment expert at Carnegie Mellon University, shows seat changes across the map, with Florida and Texas gaining four seats each, while California, New York and Illinois collectively lose eight.</p> 
<p>Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah and Idaho would all pick up one more seat, while Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island lose one seat.</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/amerredistrict/status/2016151110235423153?s=46&amp;t=Gn4QXkIC7rHYnzzbMwY5Vg" target="_blank">Another map</a> from the GOP-aligned American Redistricting Project shows less seats shifting overall, with Texas gaining four seats, Florida gaining two, and Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah and Idaho gaining one. Under that estimate, California loses four seats, and New York, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island all lose one seat.</p> 
<p>In both models, the shifts — which are significant in both projections given the already razor-thin margins in the House — stand to alter the battlefield for the 2032 presidential campaign and the fight for the House down-ballot.</p> 
<p>While the changes are “not going to lock in” GOP wins, the map is certainly shifting in their favor, said Adam Kincaid, president of the National Republican Redistricting Trust.</p> 
<p>“The Rust Belt states and Sun Belt states will continue to be the battleground,” he said. “The difference is that Republicans will be able to win the White House without a single Rust Belt state, whereas Democrats would have to sweep the Rust Belt and win in the Sun Belt.”</p> 
<p>The new maps are mostly in line <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/newsletter/2025/07/an-early-look-at-2030-reapportionment-00438139" target="_blank">with earlier estimates from Democrats</a>, who at the time presented changes to Florida and Texas specifically as the “result of population growth specifically in diverse, metropolitan, Democratic-leaning urban centers.”</p> 
<p>That is leaving the party with some tempered optimism about their fate in the Electoral College and the battle for House control.</p> 
<p>“As these folks are moving, they're bringing their politics with them,” said Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “And so I think it's not necessarily safe to assume that those population shifts don't or aren't able to impact statewide results.”</p> 
<p>But not everyone in the party saw good news between the lines. Plus, Democrats have long hoped population shifts in red states like Texas and Florida would lead to gains for the party, but so far that wish has not materialized.</p> 
<p>David Hogg, the former DNC vice chair who has embarked on a mission to primary members of his party that he believes are not doing enough to stand up to President Donald Trump, said the estimates prove that the party must invest further in the South.</p> 
<p>“If we don’t start building infrastructure in the South … we can kiss goodbye any chance of winning the white house in the 2030s,” <a href="https://x.com/davidhogg111/status/2016193134196129843?s=20" target="_blank">Hogg said on X</a>.</p> 
<p>The shifts also amplify fears from Democrats that Republicans will try and gerrymander urban areas and lessen those voters’ impact in House races, something Jenkins said is designed to “dilute the voices of these communities.”</p> 
<p>“We're going to find in states like Texas is that as those communities grow, it's going to become harder and harder for [Republicans] to gerrymander their way out of the fact that those people live there, and they're real people,” she said.</p> 
<p>Jenkins said it’s important to understand the projections “in the context of this effort to gerrymander the country into oblivion,” pointing to the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/31/the-redistricting-fight-that-dominated-american-politics-in-2025-00703193" target="_blank">White House-initiated mid-cycle redistricting effort</a> that swept the country last year.</p> 
<p>But both parties acknowledge there’s still plenty of time for populations to shift even more before the numbers are locked in during the 2030 Census.</p> 
<p>Ahead of the 2020 Census, reapportionment projections were dire for Democratic-controlled states. But the shifts ended up <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/26/census-house-apportionment-for-next-decade-484653" target="_blank">being less dramatic than anticipated</a> — in part due to an undercount of Black, Hispanic and Native American people, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/10/2020-census-undercount-black-people-hispanics-native-americans-00016138" target="_blank">the Census Bureau acknowledged</a>, that was partially triggered by the extraordinarily difficult task of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/27/census-latinos-count-484846" target="_blank">counting every American during a pandemic</a>.</p> 
<p>“It's basically halftime,” Kincaid said. “We've got 5 years to go. A lot can change.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ezra Levin, a rally organizer and the co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said in an interview that the planned third “No Kings” protest on March 28 is in response to a “secret police force terrorizing American communities.”</p> 
<p>“It is unfortunately not a surprise to us that this lawless police force is committing crimes all across the country and that people are standing up to it,” said Levin. “Our goal is safeguarding American democracy, protecting our communities and the people who are under threat by this regime.”</p> 
<p>Nationwide protests have become a staple of both of President Donald Trump’s terms. Indivisible estimated 3 million protesters turned out for its “Hands Off” rally in April 2025, while 5 million showed up in June as part of the first “No Kings” protest and 7 million for the second “No Kings” demonstration in October.</p> 
<p>Organizers said they are aiming for nearly 9 million people to turn out in March.</p> 
<p>Levin said that Indivisible had been planning the upcoming protest since before Renee Good was shot and killed by an immigration officer in Minnesota earlier this month, calling <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-trump-administration-dueling-accounts-minneapolis-shooting-00745811?utm_campaign=mb&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morning_brew" target="_blank">what is unfolding in the Midwestern state</a> is “tragic and horrific.” A second person, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minnesota-tim-walz-shooting-minneapolis-00745570" target="_blank">Alex Pretti, was killed by Border Patrol agents</a> on Saturday not far from where Good died.</p> 
<p>Still, Levin said, it is “inspiring and gives me hope that while this regime and many political leaders even outside this regime are cowards or fascist sympathizers, people on the ground aren't putting up with it.”</p> 
<p>Trump and his GOP allies have not been fans of the demonstrations. Ahead of the October marches — which took place amid the government shutdown — Speaker Mike Johnson called <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/no-kings-protest-mike-johnson-00602705" target="_blank">them “hate America” rallies</a>, and Trump’s “war room” account posted a mocking picture of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/18/no-kings-rallies-trump-washington-00613973" target="_blank">president wearing a crown</a>.</p> 
<p>Levin said the organizers are taking safety precautions, including holding de-escalation training sessions. On Monday, the group held a session on non-violent documentation techniques for the public. And at the last “No Kings” protest, Levin said Indivisible trained thousands of volunteer marshals, emphasizing non-violent principles.</p> 
<p>The tactics have a proven track record, Levin argued, with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/20/arrests-no-kings-new-york-austin-chicago-dc-san-diego-trump-administration-police" target="_blank">major cities reporting zero arrests</a> during the last “No Kings” demonstration.</p> 
<p>Still, Levin said, he can’t guarantee there aren’t risks to participating.</p> 
<p>“Based on how the regime is behaving, the fact of the matter is, everybody should worry about it,” he said. “I can't guarantee that there isn’t a risk involved to show up and exercise your constitutional rights. It's a terrible thing to have to say in 2026 in America, but it's the truth.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats should “play hardball” ahead of a looming partial government shutdown and use their “leverage to reform ICE,” according to a new <a href="https://www.searchlightinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Memo-Play-Hardball-and-Use-Your-Leverage-to-Reform-ICE.pdf" target="_blank">polling memo</a> circulating among Democratic senators Tuesday.</p> 
<p>The polling, in the field January 23 to 26 during the height of public backlash to Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis, found that 58 percent of likely midterm voters want ICE to be reined in. More voters prefer reforming ICE than the number who prefer eliminating the agency entirely by 30 percent to 19 percent, according to the survey shared first with POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“Voters want ICE to follow the law, and focus enforcement on people who pose a threat to public safety. They want to see tangible changes to ICE operations and oppose letting ICE detain U.S. citizens, enter homes without warrants, or fail to wear identifying uniforms,” according to the memo. “There is a desire for immigration enforcement that is lawful, reasonable, and effective. “</p> 
<p>The memo was written by Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) and top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), for his organization the Searchlight Institute, which conducted the 1,502-person online survey alongside Tavern Research.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/03/dems-are-quietly-forming-a-think-tank-to-help-them-win-again-00381601" target="_blank">The influential new think tank</a> seeks to push the Democratic Party toward broadly popular positions, regardless of ideology. In the case of ICE, Jentleson writes, Democrats should embrace reforming, not abolishing, the agency.</p> 
<p>“Democrats should use their leverage to demand commonsense reforms to ICE that have the backing of broad bipartisan majorities of Americans,” Jentleson writes in the memo, which came across the desk of aides to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday and continued to make the rounds among Senate Democrats early Wednesday.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Searchlight’s latest survey finds that “bipartisan majorities of voters oppose ICE’s lawless tactics, including detaining U.S. citizens (73 percent), entering people’s homes without warrants (79 percent), and failing to wear clearly identifying uniforms (70 percent)”, according to the memo.</p> 
<p>The polling comes as Senate Democrats are <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/cuellar-dhs-blank-check-00749995" target="_blank">demanding to re-negotiate</a> a hulking DHS funding bill ahead of a Friday midnight deadline for a partial government shutdown, carving it off from a six-bill appropriations package.</p> 
<p>“This is likely to be their last major leverage point for several months at least if not for the rest of the year” to curtail the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Jentleson told POLITICO. “But there’s a larger reason, which is that the tragic events that have unfolded in Minneapolis have shocked the conscience of Americans and brought their attention to the horrible shit that ICE is doing. Those two things combined give them a lot of leverage at this moment.”</p> 
<p>Democratic likely midterm voters were split in the poll over how to change ICE, with 34 percent favoring reforming ICE and 33 percent wanting to get rid of it as an agency — meaning that it’s “a coin flip among Democrats,” Jentleson said. That indicates that in contested Democratic primaries, it’s not clear which side of that debate will have the edge with base voters.</p> 
<p>What’s clearer, he wrote in the memo, is that voters do support some degree of immigration enforcement. The memo notes that the view that “immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should not be deported” receives no more than 30 percent support among Democrats and young people, and even less among other groups.</p> 
<p>Senate Democrats have embraced this push.</p> 
<p>Speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday, Schumer seemed to set the predicate for the partial shutdown, saying any administrative actions on ICE wouldn’t be enough and that “any fix should come from Congress. The public can’t trust the administration to do the right thing on its own and the Republicans and Democrats must work together to make that happen.”</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans face a Friday midnight deadline to avert a shutdown. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have said that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be fired. President Donald Trump acknowledged shaking up his border security leadership team Tuesday.</p> 
<p>“Senate Democrats should embrace this reality and use their leverage to achieve meaningful changes that rein in ICE’s abuses and refocus the agency on its critical law enforcement mission,” Jentleson writes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The RNC distributed talking points highlighting Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino’s false statements about the killing of Alex Pretti just hours before he was sidelined by President Donald Trump — a sign of how quickly the party’s messaging has shifted on the events in Minneapolis.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019c-01f7-d9a8-a7be-87f729550001" target="_blank">The memo</a>, sent to party surrogates midday on Monday and obtained by POLITICO, encouraged Republicans to cast blame for the shooting on Democrats for “inciting protestors to attack and aggressively confront law enforcement in Minneapolis.” The talking points also delve into administration officials’ account of how the shooting took place, including Bovino’s Saturday comments that the U.S. citizen killed by immigration agents “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement." The government’s initial account has been called into question by videos shot by witnesses as well as analyses conducted by The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-federal-agents-video.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/minneapolis-shooting-alex-pretti/card/wsj-visual-investigation-videos-contradict-u-s-account-of-minneapolis-shooting-lrNpSm80hhnrxVxEy7kO?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqeMfXHa-r5f_coUtyWU2TDX_pUwGzct7ciQYXf_QuPsBeDX-5YqhaQBv69a5x8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69793983&amp;gaa_sig=DSspyLz-8HCs-CWTnsRr3TjzrIBrFPt1TzRmBugZwzesss81GIE8xUHvg0x1nkczT8b97u7hD1yc8-EZ9pRSsg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>, and others.</p> 
<p>The memo includes the talking point that “Agents attempted to disarm the individual as he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a Border Patrol agent fired defensive shots.” Video from the scene appears to contradict that statement.</p> 
<p>The whiplash between the RNC’s promotion of Bovino’s comments and his sudden removal shortly afterward from the federal operation in Minneapolis shows how the administration and other Republicans scrambled to contain the fallout from the shooting. A significant number of elected GOP officials have called for an official investigation into the matter, a rare and notable break with the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>Immediately following the shooting on Saturday, high-profile administration officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem publicly described Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/leavitt-briefing-minneapolis-trump-walz-alex-pretti-00747495" target="_blank">“domestic terrorist.”</a></p> 
<p>By that evening, however, Trump was already more cautious in his description of what had transpired. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-administration-is-reviewing-everything-about-minneapolis-shooting-a501f48e?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcZVoLjAgLS_LENGeVH-NWCqZFB9zgFqjGu85ixp9xYdgMDpDSXuPw2gtxFkd8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69792383&amp;gaa_sig=nUi-HJXipOVQ2Rgqh7-IB_Dhu-dAq4sY2s6SwobYlLst1e3NtzUYThMdV4gHRtW4R2uldBGkMhRutTfX9moJxA%3D%3D" target="_blank">In an interview that day with The Wall Street Journal</a>, the president did not answer directly when asked whether the officer involved in the shooting did the right thing and said his administration is “reviewing everything.”</p> 
<p>Speaking at a restaurant in Iowa on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/trump-pretti-shouldnt-have-been-carrying-a-gun-00750241" target="_blank">Trump said that he hadn’t heard the assessment</a> from Noem and others in his administration, such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” or assassin, but said that “certainly he shouldn’t have been carrying a gun.” Pretti had a permit to carry a firearm, according to Minnesota officials.</p> 
<p>Monday’s talking points memo notably omits reference to any comments made by Noem since the shooting took place. While the White House has publicly stood behind Noem, administration allies have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/kristi-noem-scrutiny-minneapolis-shootings-00748618" target="_blank">increasingly placed blame on the secretary’s handling of the chaotic crackdown in Minnesota</a> as calls among Democrats for her impeachment have grown. <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/27/congress/thom-tillis-kristi-noem-fired-00750580" target="_blank">On Tuesday evening</a>, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Noem should be “out of a job,” while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she “should go.”</p> 
<p>Trump announced on Monday morning that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/trump-border-czar-minneapolis-00746125" target="_blank">border czar Tom Homan would go to Minneapolis</a> to oversee the administration’s immigration operation there, a move seen as an acknowledgement that DHS’s leadership had mishandled the situation. Hours later, Bovino had been removed from his post as commander at large, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/" target="_blank">according to The Atlantic</a>.</p> 
<p>Kiersten Pels, a spokesperson for the RNC, would not confirm the authenticity of the memo but echoed its overall sentiment in a written statement. “Democrats incited this violence by encouraging protesters to confront law enforcement,” she wrote. “Democrats are demonizing ICE and threatening to defund DHS instead of condemning attacks on officers – while President Trump and Republicans stand with law enforcement and public safety.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s approval rating on immigration has dropped significantly since he first came into office, with only 39% of Americans now approving of the president’s handling of immigration, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-approval-drops-record-low-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-26/" target="_blank">recent Reuters/Ipsos poll</a>. The high-profile shooting in Minneapolis, following the fatal shooting earlier this month of Renée Good in the city, has only brought more attention to the administration’s goal of a mass deportation.</p> 
<p>Democrats in the Senate have pledged to vote against funding DHS in a crucial vote later this week unless the bill is amended to add guardrails for the agency — and the RNC’s talking points seize on the potential for a partial government shutdown as well.</p> 
<p>“Now, Democrats are threatening to defund law enforcement later this week by refusing to pass a DHS funding bill,” the memo concludes.</p> 
<p>“While Democrats will stand in the way of ICE and law enforcement to defend terrorists and criminal aliens, President Trump and Republicans are working to keep our communities safe.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUGUSTA, Maine — Gov. Janet Mills issued a dire warning in her annual address to state lawmakers Tuesday night: The federal immigration raids sweeping the state are part of an ongoing nationwide attack on democracy.</p> 
<p>The speech from Mills, who is a leading Democratic challenger to Republican Sen. Susan Collins, marks perhaps the most prominent example of how the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids have upended communities — and potentially electoral politics — around the country. The crackdown has become a political crisis for the White House in recent days following two fatal shootings by federal officers in Minnesota.</p> 
<p>“Today, I say to the people of Maine: We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced,” Mills said, to cheers from the Democratic side of the chamber. “And to anyone outside these halls, including any federal officials, I say: If you seek to harm Maine people, you will have to go through me first.”</p> 
<p>The Democratic governor’s defiant State of the State address on Tuesday came as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/ice-maine-dhs-trump-00740138" target="_blank">a sweeping ICE operation in Maine</a> has prompted widespread protests throughout the state since it began last week. The killing of a protester in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers this weekend has amplified those pressures — and the political stakes.</p> 
<p>Mills addressed the ICE operation directly in the opening of her speech, commending the “moral clarity” of Mainers who had risen to “protect their neighbors and their communities against federal agents who seek to intimidate and silence us.”</p> 
<p>Federal officials indicated Monday that <a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/immigration/2026-01-26/ice-says-its-arrested-more-than-200-people-since-last-week-in-maine-operation" target="_blank">more than 200 people had been arrested</a> in the immigrant enforcement action in Maine they’re calling Operation Catch of the Day. That effort has followed a pattern of surges in other localities under President Donald Trump’s aggressive revamped enforcement operations.</p> 
<p>Mills, who has made opposition to Trump a centerpiece of her Senate campaign, cast the immigration enforcement operation as part of a broader federal overreach that threatens American democracy in Tuesday’s speech — warning “the very idea of America is in peril.” She accused federal officials of arresting people not on “public safety grounds but based on quotas, on skin color, on accents, and religion and ethnic origin.”</p> 
<p>“For those who may be unconcerned by the federal government’s abuses of today, affecting our state, I only ask you to consider this — what happens when the federal government finds you to be the problem tomorrow?” Mills said, her voice rising and cracking with emotion in a departure from the more soft-spoken tone she had adopted while ticking through the policy points of her speech.</p> 
<p>Much of Mills’ speech was met with partisan reaction in the House chamber in Augusta, with some Republican lawmakers audibly pushing back at Mills’ notion that ICE activities amounted to an abuse of power. Earlier in her speech, Republican state Rep. Jim Thorne interrupted Mills’ call for the federal government to enact universal health care, suggesting it was out of place for a State of the State speech.</p> 
<p>Mills’ address to the legislature came days after <a href="https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-janet-mills-statement-following-another-killing-minnesota-hands-federal-agents-2026" target="_blank">she asked for a meeting with Trump</a> to call for a withdrawal of ICE agents from Maine. The Maine governor famously confronted Trump at the Oval Office last year over his administration’s intent to withhold federal funding from Maine over the state’s allowance of transgender students’ participation in youth sports.</p> 
<p>The politics of Trump’s deportation campaign have rapidly evolved in the wake of two shootings in Minnesota, putting ICE at the forefront of both the Democratic primary between Mills and political newcomer Graham Platner, and their efforts to unseat Collins.</p> 
<p>Collins — who has conflicted with the Trump administration more than most Republicans — <a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2026-01-27/susan-collins-asks-dhs-to-pause-immigration-enforcement-surge-in-maine-and-minnesota" target="_blank">told Maine Public</a> on Tuesday that she had asked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to pause the immigration enforcement surge in both Maine and Minnesota, calling it sweeping and indiscriminate. Those detained in Maine have included a corrections officer trainee who the Cumberland County sheriff <a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/courts-and-crime/2026-01-22/cumberland-county-sheriff-kevin-joyce-denounces-actions-by-ice-agents-in-maine" target="_blank">said had a legal work permit</a>.</p> 
<p>Mills has called on Collins to join with Democrats in holding up DHS funding until ICE changes course. Minutes before her speech, she <a href="https://x.com/JanetMillsforME/status/2016278711759253867?s=20" target="_blank">castigated Collins</a> on social media for <a href="https://x.com/JanetMillsforME/status/2016299356584890596?s=20" target="_blank">not calling for Noem’s ouster</a> and for “pushing to give the agency more funding without any accountability.” Collins oversees ICE’s purse strings as the Senate’s top appropriator, and she has advocated for passing the DHS funding bill as a Saturday shutdown deadline looms, saying it includes new guardrails for ICE such as body cameras and training and would fund other key agencies such as FEMA and the Coast Guard.</p> 
<p>The Democratic governor has also faced criticism from her left, with Platner attacking her Monday for her handling of a bill last year that sought to limit law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p> 
<p>Platner blasted Mills in an interview Monday for letting the bill idle, saying the governor “stymied the state’s ability to prepare” for the surge of federal immigration agents that “many in the immigrant rights community and the immigrant community knew … was coming” by preventing the law from taking effect sooner.</p> 
<p>Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature in December, which means it does not officially take effect until after the end of this year’s legislative session. However, the Portland Press Herald <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2026/01/21/a-new-anti-ice-law-isnt-in-effect-yet-maine-state-police-are-already-following-it/" target="_blank">reported earlier this month</a> that Maine’s public safety commissioner had implemented a directive to immediately comply with the law’s provisions.</p> 
<p>Platner dismissed her escalating rhetoric against ICE as politically convenient.</p> 
<p>“For the governor now to kind of just read the tea leaves and realize that people are actually really angry about this and want to see action, and then suddenly be like ‘I’m fighting this tooth and nail’ while not even fighting tooth and nail … yeah, that’s going to be a pretty clear distinction for the voters of Maine,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jack Hurley Jr., a judge on the Tazewell County circuit court, ruled that Democrats did <a href="https://www.virginiascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CL25001582-00-PO-95_Certified.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"><u>not follow the right procedure</u></a> to approve the proposed constitutional amendment that would allow for the last-minute redraw of the state’s lines.</p> 
<p>Democrats are expected to appeal the decision. But the ruling is still a major loss for the party in the ongoing mid-decade redistricting fight, and one that could — if ultimately upheld — block the party from picking up as many as four seats in next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>Democrats in the Legislature first passed a measure to take up redistricting <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/31/virginia-senate-approves-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment-in-party-line-vote/" target="_blank"><u>in October of last year</u></a>, utilizing a special session left open by then-Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Lawmakers <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/16/virginia-redistricting-legislature-00733644" target="_blank"><u>took up the issue again in January</u></a>, finalizing the plan to put the issue before voters ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>But Hurley said using the still-open special session was not allowed because early voting in last year’s elections had already begun, and state law requires the Legislature to pass proposed constitutional amendments both before and after an election. Hurley also ruled that the proposed constitutional amendment was not properly noticed in state courts.</p> 
<p>The judge also noted that lawmakers in the special session passed a procedural resolution along party lines, with the Democrat-controlled legislature delivering the decisive votes for the resolution’s passage. Because lawmakers did not vote unanimously, as is required under the Legislature’s own rules, and did not pass it by a two-thirds Senate majority, it was a violation of the rules governing a special session.</p> 
<p>“Certinaly, both houses of the Commonwealth’s legislature are required to follow their own rules and resolutions,” Hurley wrote.</p> 
<p>The Republican plaintiffs in the suit issued a statement praising the court’s ruling, calling it a “decisive victory for the rule of law” but also noting this legal challenge was not about partisanship, rather the process the majority used in attempting to rewrite Virginia’s Constitution.</p> 
<p>"The court confirmed that Democrat legislative leaders unlawfully expanded a Special Session, violated their own rules, and attempted to force through a redistricting constitutional amendment while Virginians were already voting,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the top Republican in the Virginia House, state Sen. Minority Leader Ryan McDougle and former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said in a joint statement Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Virginia had been seen as the crown jewel in Democrats' redistricting fight, especially as state Republicans in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/desantis-florida-redistricting-special-session-00713882" target="_blank"><u>GOP-led Florida eye midcycle redistricting</u></a> later this year. Currently in Virginia, Democrats control six congressional seats and Republicans hold five. Virginia Democrats, had been forging ahead with their plans to unveil a proposed map by their self-imposed deadline of Jan. 31, with the goal of holding a special election to approve the maps in spring.</p> 
<p>Democrats strongly criticized Hurley’s ruling.</p> 
<p>“This is a clear attempt to confuse voters and block them from having a say,” said Kéren Charles Dongo, who is heading Virginians for Fair Elections, the Democrat-affiliated group that launched this month to urge the state's voters to pass a pending ballot measure. “We’re prepared for what comes next, and Virginians deserve both the right to vote and the chance to level the playing field.”</p> 
<p>Spokespeople for the top Democrats in the Virginia legislature, state Sen. Majority Leader Scott Surovell and state House Speaker Don Scott, did not respond to requests for comment on whether the ruling will impact the release of their proposed maps.</p> 
<p>But in a joint statement along with other top Virginia Democrats on Tuesday, the group struck a defiant tone and promised to continue with plans to redraw maps, suggesting the ruling was but a minor blip in their quest to deliver what could be a 10-1 map that favors their party.</p> 
<p>“Nothing that happened today will dissuade us from continuing to move forward and put this matter directly to the voters,” the Democratic lawmakers said. “We will be appealing this ruling immediately and we expect to prevail.”</p> 
<p>Julie Merz, who heads up the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, suggested the court overreached. </p> 
<p>"This rogue decision is a disappointing, but temporary setback issued by a lower court that will be immediately appealed — where we're confident it will be overturned," Merz said in a statement. "The order issued today has no constitutional basis, but is instead a desperate attempt to keep electoral power out of the hands of Virginia voters."<br></p>CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Kéren Charles Dongo's name.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famed American composer Philip Glass on Tuesday announced he is pulling the premiere of his newest symphony, titled “Lincoln,” from the Kennedy Center, becoming the latest performer to cut ties with the beleaguered institution since its takeover by President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>“Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,” Glass said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUBSBMejT_5/?igsh=MTM5NGVmcXh4YnYzZg==" target="_blank">in a post on social media</a>. “Therefore, I feel an obligation to withdraw this Symphony premiere from the Kennedy Center under its current leadership.”</p> 
<p>He joins a growing list of artists who have canceled performances at the Kennedy Center since Trump’s overhaul of Washington’s premier arts center. Grammy winner Renee Fleming canceled performances set for May, <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/nso/home/2025-2026/gaffigan/" target="_blank">the institution announced on its website</a>. More performers, including banjo player Béla Fleck and singer Sonia De Los Santos, as well as groups such as the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Seattle Children’s Theater, have also canceled planned shows.</p> 
<p>Trump has made rebranding the Kennedy Center a priority since returning to the White House early last year. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/donald-trump-kennedy-center-014498" target="_blank">axed several members from the center’s board</a> and installed himself as chair in February 2025, later bringing on longtime ally Richard <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-ric-grenell-kennedy-center-00203484" target="_blank">Grenell to serve as interim executive director</a>.</p> 
<p>In December, the newly reformed Kennedy Center’s board voted to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/trump-kennedy-center-00698140" target="_blank">add the president’s name</a> to the building. One lawmaker, Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), an ex officio member of the board, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/23/kennedy-center-lawsuit-trump-00704327" target="_blank">sued in protest</a>.</p> 
<p>Trump has also taken a personal interest in a refurbishment of the Center, including overseeing details <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115787817857959030" target="_blank">down to the theater’s armrests</a>.</p> 
<p>Glass, 88, is one of the country’s most celebrated living composers, <a href="https://www.eno.org/discover-opera/articles/the-beginners-guide-to-philip-glass/" target="_blank">an early pioneer of minimalism</a> in classical music and famous in part for scores in films such as 2002’s "The Hours" and "The Truman Show," starring Jim Carrey.</p> 
<p>“We have no place for politics in the arts, and those calling for boycotts based on politics are making the wrong decision," Roma Daravi, the institution's vice president of public relations, said in a statement. "We have not cancelled a single show. Leftist activists are pushing artists to cancel but the public wants artists to perform and create—not cancel under pressure from political insiders that benefit from creating division.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Democratic opposition research powerhouse is putting massive troves of its work product online ahead of the midterms. And it’s using artificial intelligence to help everyone from campaigns to podcasters figure out how to navigate it.</p> 
<p>The project from American Bridge 21st Century, shared first with POLITICO, reflects an expansion of its efforts ahead of the 2026 midterms — as well as the evolving nature of political campaigning, including oppo research, in an increasingly fragmented media environment.</p> 
<p>“Swing voters are generally speaking getting their information very ambiently,” American Bridge President Pat Dennis said in an interview. </p> 
<p>A challenge in recent election cycles, he said, has not been a lack of opposition research, but rather how to best convey it when more voters are getting political news from podcasts, social media influencers or group chats. “If people can’t find it or read it, it’s no good,” Dennis said.</p> 
<p>The new tool, <a href="https://research-books.com/" target="_blank">titled Research Books</a>, is a public-facing website featuring opposition research on dozens of Republican candidates in races that American Bridge has identified as crucial to deciding control of Congress. It also includes select statewide candidates.</p> 
<p>Pages for each candidate feature messaging around key votes, candidate-specific research and — in some races — videos from Democratic trackers and sample media based on the oppo that closely resemble campaign ads.</p> 
<p>It also includes an AI-powered search tool that aims to bring together different sources about a candidate into cohesive messaging. (The AI agent only probes the super PAC’s internal database, not external sources or the wider internet.) </p> 
<p>Results from the search link back to original sources, which include news articles, videos and public records. The tool also integrates with other external large language model platforms such as ChatGPT.</p> 
<p>The notion of publishing opposition research files online, rather than keeping them closely held by party operatives for strategic deployment, is not entirely new for American Bridge. Ahead of the 2020 election, the group <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/07/american-bridge-trump-oppo-book-392536" target="_blank">posted 1,043 pages of opposition research</a> about President Donald Trump online for use by other Democratic groups. </p> 
<p>Sharing such research publicly is a way for super PACs to avoid running afoul of campaign finance laws that prohibit direction coordination.</p> 
<p>Because the new research tool is publicly available online, it could similarly be used by Democratic campaigns or other outside groups — though American Bridge hopes the uptake is broader than that, including among influencers and voters.</p> 
<p>For its initial public rollout, Research Books includes 15 GOP House incumbents in seats Democrats are hoping to flip this year, along with Republican Senate candidates in four seats Democrats are trying to flip, as well as Georgia, where Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking reelection.</p> 
<p>The initial list also includes 15 candidates for governor or attorney general in key states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Hampshire and Iowa.</p> 
<p>The inclusion of attorney general candidates, newer territory for American Bridge, reflects in part the greater role that they have played in suing the Trump administration, Dennis said. He expects the tool to include more races and candidates as the midterms near, with the super PAC seeking to help Democrats cast a broad net.</p> 
<p>“There are times where opposition research can fundamentally reshape a race, so we prefer to take an expansive view on this,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Klobuchar planned to officially launch her gubernatorial campaign on Monday, but has delayed it in the wake of the fatal shooting of a protester by immigration agents in Minneapolis over the weekend, according to two people familiar with the Minnesota Democrat’s plans.</p> 
<p>The senator instead spent Monday morning speaking to White House officials, urging deescalation and pushing to get the administration to end its immigration crackdown in her state, according to a third person, who is close to the senator and, like the others, was granted anonymity to describe private conversations.</p> 
<p>Her decision to wait on her campaign launch comes amid weeks of turmoil in Minnesota that further escalated over the weekend when Border Patrol agents on Saturday fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and American citizen.</p> 
<p>Over the last two days, Klobuchar has been meeting with city and state leaders, strategizing with Senate colleagues over Department of Homeland Security funding and calling Trump administration officials, according to the third person, who said Klobuchar’s “focus is on de-escalating the situation and getting ICE out of Minnesota. There's not time for politics today.”</p> 
<p>Klobuchar’s nascent gubernatorial campaign has run headlong into a national crisis, another twist for a campaign that started under unusual circumstances. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz unexpectedly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/05/tim-walz-out-minnesota-00710541" target="_blank"><u>dropped his reelection bid</u></a> for a third term, as a swirling fraud scandal threatened to engulf his campaign, and met with Klobuchar about running for the office herself. Since then, two American citizens have been killed by federal immigration agents, thrusting Klobuchar into the center of a battle on an issue for which she’s traditionally cut a moderate profile.</p> 
<p>“Regardless of what [campaign] Klobuchar is considering, this is what I’d expect from her, she’s been the leader in this state,” said Democratic Minnesota state Sen. Grant Hauschild. “We’re facing unprecedented circumstances of federal overreach and harm to our communities, and she’s stepped up, being present on the ground and fighting in Congress.”</p> 
<p>The two people who described her changed launch plans said they expect the senator to formally launch before next Tuesday, when the state’s party precinct caucus kicks off. Klobuchar <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/22/klobuchar-files-paperwork-minnesota-governor-00741649" target="_blank"><u>already filed paperwork with the state’s campaign finance board</u></a> last week, allowing her to begin raising funds ahead of an expected bid.</p> 
<p>Pretti’s killing also shook up the GOP side of the Minnesota governors’ race. Chris Madel, an attorney who launched his campaign as a Republican late last year, announced on Monday he would be dropping out, calling the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics “wrong” and “an unmitigated disaster.”</p> 
<p>“I cannot support the national Republican-stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,” he said <a href="https://x.com/CWMadel/status/2015783448091283559?s=20" target="_blank"><u>in a video posted to social media</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Klobuchar is not expected to face a serious Democratic opponent when she enters the gubernatorial race, giving her some breathing room on both her announcement timeline and on her stance on immigration. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a well-known progressive who was considered a potential candidate, confirmed he would not be running for the job last week.</p> 
<p>“What you hear from Klobuchar is, ‘ICE needs to get out of here,’ and I don’t think she needs to say more than that [because] without a primary challenger, I don’t think she’ll have to change her position on it,” said a Minnesota Democratic strategist, granted anonymity to discuss the issue candidly. “She’s smart, she’s careful and she’s cautious, and she knows how to win suburban and independent voters.”</p> 
<p>Klobuchar has always cut a moderate profile. She rose up in Hennepin County as its prosecutor before running for Senate. During her presidential campaign in 2020, Klobuchar rejected calls for “abolishing ICE,” drawing fire from immigration rights advocates groups in that race, and instead called for reforms of the agency.</p> 
<p>When asked during <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/amy-klobuchar-says-ice-is-making-us-less-safe-after-another-fatal-mn-shooting-full-interview-256544325570" target="_blank"><u>an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press”</u></a> on Sunday whether she supported abolishing ICE, Klobuchar said “we’re always going to have some immigration enforcement in this country, and border control.” But she called for the ICE operation to leave the state because “this agency has been functioning is completely against every tenet of law enforcement.”</p> 
<p>Klobuchar ticked through several reforms she supports: “New leadership. Stopping these surges across the country, not just in my state. Training them like they were supposed to be trained. ... Mandatory body cameras. Stopping ramming into people's houses without a judicial warrant.”</p> 
<p>Those specifics could become part of Senate Democrats’ demands to give enough votes to pass a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other parts of the government.</p> 
<p>Other Democrats have called for more aggressive policies, including abolishing ICE altogether. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) <a href="https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/2015544841405350257" target="_blank"><u>posted on X</u></a> that “voting NO on the DHS funding bill is the bare minimum,” adding that ICE is “beyond reform” and to “abolish it.”</p> 
<p>Klobuchar’s approach is once again drawing criticism from some immigrant-rights advocates. “I do not believe that's far enough,” said George Escobar, executive director of CASA, an immigration advocacy organization. “Unless we deal with the cancer that is causing this, which is ICE itself, and unless we have a comprehensive reform of that agency, which to us, means abolishing it, then honestly, this cycle is just going to repeat over and over again.”One Democratic consultant who has worked on Minnesota races warned that Klobuchar’s deliberative approach could hurt her. “She’s incredibly cautious, and this is not a cautious moment,” they said. “So far, she has not put her foot in it by being too moderate, but she’s also not been under a huge spotlight — and that will change with the gubernatorial run.”</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, Klobuchar’s messaging earned her praise from even some progressives. "I think she’s spot on,” said Mark Longabaugh, a former adviser to Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “If you're going to step up and say that this organization needs to be restructured, or shut down and restructured, you also have to tie that to, ‘Listen, there is a legitimate law enforcement need here, both for customs and for border control.’”</p> 
<p>Most Minnesota Democrats don’t think Klobuchar will suddenly center anti-ICE messaging in her gubernatorial campaign. Interviews with a half dozen operatives and elected officials found they still expected the campaign to largely revolve around the economy. “Affordability is still going to be central to her work, along with protecting her state,” said the person close to Klobuchar. “She will always stand up for Minnesota on both.”</p> 
<p>“Who knows if, in 10 months, it will specifically be a part of the narrative or messaging,” said a Minnesota Democratic donor adviser. “But this isn’t going to go away any time soon … because we’re traumatized here.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Portland Trail Blazer center Chris Dudley has launched a second attempt to run for governor of Oregon as a Republican, a long-shot bid in a blue state even as the incumbent has struggled in polls.</p> 
<p>Dudley, who played six seasons for the Trail Blazers and 16 for the NBA overall, said in an announcement video Monday that he would ease divisiveness and focus on public safety, affordability and education in a state where support for Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek has been low for her entire tenure.</p> 
<p>“The empty promises, the name calling, the finger pointing and fear mongering that has solved nothing must stop,” said in <a href="https://www.dudley4oregon.com/" target="_blank">his election announcement</a>. “There are real solutions, and I have a plan.”</p> 
<p>Dudley is one of the most successful Republicans of the last 25 years in Oregon, coming within 2 points of defeating Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber in 2010.</p> 
<p>“I think it’s imperative that we get somebody from outside of Salem who’s away from the partisan politics, away from the name calling, the finger pointing,” Dudley <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2026/01/former-blazer-chris-dudley-will-run-for-oregon-governor-setting-up-heated-republican-primary.html" target="_blank">told The Oregonian</a>. “Who has the expertise and background and the ability to bring people together to solve these issues.”</p> 
<p>In <a href="https://www.dudley4oregon.com/" target="_blank">his election announcement,</a> Dudley spoke about his love of the state and frustration people have with the current state of politics. He mentioned education, safety and affordability as key issues he plans to address but did not give any key policy specifics.</p> 
<p>Dudley is a Yale graduate who worked in finance after leaving the NBA. A diabetic, he also founded a foundation focused on children with Type 1 diabetes.</p> 
<p>In the GOP primary, Dudley faces a field that includes state Sen. Christine Drazan, who lost to Kotek by nearly 4 percentage points in 2022.</p> 
<p>Other candidates include another state lawmaker, a county commissioner and <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2026/01/this-jan-6-rioter-who-was-pardoned-by-trump-is-now-running-for-oregon-governor.html" target="_blank">a conservative influencer</a> who was pardoned by President Donald Trump for his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p> 
<p>Kotek is a relatively unpopular governor. Her approval rating has consistently remained under 50 percent her entire term in office, <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/governor-approval-ratings" target="_blank">according to polling analysis by Morning Consult</a>. In December, she announced her intention to seek reelection.</p> 
<p>Despite expectations that Democrats will do well in the midterms, a number of Oregon Republicans have become more involved in state politics since the last election.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence on Monday called video footage of the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota “deeply troubling” as he urged a full investigation into the deadly incident.</p> 
<p>“In the wake of the tragic shooting that claimed the life of Alex Pretti this weekend, our prayers are with his family, the citizens of Minneapolis and local, state and federal law enforcement officers serving there,” <a href="https://x.com/Mike_Pence/status/2015813964605636760?s=20" target="_blank">Pence said in a post on X</a>. “The images of this incident are deeply troubling and a full and transparent investigation of this officer involved shooting must take place immediately.”</p> 
<p>Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minnesota-tim-walz-shooting-minneapolis-00745570" target="_blank">shot and killed</a> by Border Patrol agents on Saturday. The incident, which occurred about 2 miles from where Renee Good was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7, has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-trump-administration-dueling-accounts-minneapolis-shooting-00745811" target="_blank">ignited a heated debate</a> between the Trump administration and Minnesota officials amid intense scrutiny of the tactics of the president's immigration crackdown. </p> 
<p>Protesters have flooded the streets of Minnesota in the aftermath of Pretti’s killing.</p> 
<p>State leaders have <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5705051-alex-pretti-federal-shooting-investigation/" target="_blank">alleged federal officials have blocked them</a> from being involved in an investigation into the shooting. Administration officials have accused Minnesota authorities of refusing to collaborate with immigration authorities on deportations.</p> 
<p>But Pence on Monday called for law enforcement at all levels to work together on investigating the latest shooting.</p> 
<p>“The focus now should be to bring together law enforcement at every level to address the concerns in the community even while ensuring that dangerous illegal aliens are apprehended and no longer a threat to families in Minneapolis,” Pence said.</p> 
<p>The former vice president is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/republicans-concern-minneapolis-shooting-00745707" target="_blank">the latest high-profile Republican to express concerns</a> over the events unfolding in Minnesota. Like Pence, some of the party’s top voices have called for a full investigation into the shooting. </p> 
<p>Others have disputed the administration's justification that Pretti’s carrying of a gun was legal justification for his killing, which Pence echoed on Monday.</p> 
<p>“The American people deserve to have safe streets, our laws enforced and our constitutional rights of Freedom of Speech, peaceable assembly and the right to keep and bear Arms respected and preserved all at the same time,” said Pence. “That’s how Law and Order and Freedom work together in America.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anti-Muslim rhetoric has emerged as a potent ingredient in the looming Texas Republican primary while candidates compete to raise fears about the spread of Sharia law in the state and portray themselves as the toughest option to stand against it.</p> 
<p>From the state’s white-hot GOP Senate primary down to local races, Republican candidates are pledging to fight the hardest against a proposed residential development of 1,000 homes centered around a Mosque north of Dallas, while issuing dire warnings about the supposed threat of Islam and questioning their opponents’ commitment to the cause.</p> 
<p>Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and his top primary opponent, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, have sparred in attack ads and on the trail over that project and Afghan refugee resettlement program, at times veering into inflammatory anti-Islamic rhetoric. Cornyn called for a federal investigation into the project; Paxton launched several probes and in December sued the development over alleged securities fraud.</p> 
<p>Texas is a heavily diverse state, with non-Hispanic whites representing less than two fifths of its total population — a flashpoint for years on the right. The state’s relatively small but fast-growing Muslim population has become a charged issue for Republicans seeking to distinguish themselves in competitive races. This year’s GOP ads – which vary from condemning terror attacks to burning the Quran – represent an escalation of rhetoric the party has long used to rally its voters.</p> 
<p>“The Muslim community is the boogeyman for this cycle,” said Texas GOP consultant Vinny Minchillo. “One hundred percent this message works — there's no question about it. This has been polled up one side and down the other, and with Texas Republican primary voters, it works. It is a thing they are legitimately scared of.”</p> 
<p>Muslim advocacy organizations and Democrats decry the ads as racist and grossly inaccurate characterizations of those communities.</p> 
<p>“The Texas GOP has declared war on Islam in Texas, claiming that Islamic leaders in the state are implementing Sharia law and using it in court,” said Joel Montfort, a north Texas-based Democratic strategist. “None of it is true, it is just fearmongering and racism to stir up the GOP base and get them to vote.”</p> 
<p>A POLITICO review identified ads in half a dozen races since the start of 2025 that highlighted “Sharia law,” according to data from AdImpact, which tracks political advertising. All were from or backing Republican candidates touting their fights against it, and most were common in Texas.</p> 
<p>Last week, Cornyn launched a seven-figure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vD6gujdRfE" target="_blank"><u>ad</u></a> buy titled “Evil Face” that declares “radical Islam is a bloodthirsty ideology,” referencing the Oct. 7 Hamas attack against Israel and December Bondi Beach shooting in Australia. The ad also references his bill to revoke the tax-exempt status of Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy organization.</p> 
<p>Paxton has <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/2014344216508498073?s=20" target="_blank"><u>gone after</u></a> Cornyn’s past support of an Afghan refugee resettlement program. And in his capacity as attorney general, Paxton <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/05/texas-ken-paxton-epic-city-lawsuit/" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> the project is an “illegal land development scheme” and its leaders are “engaged in a radical plot to destroy hundreds of acres of beautiful Texas land and line their own pockets.”</p> 
<p>In the four-way GOP race for Texas attorney general, candidate Aaron Reitz says in an <a href="https://x.com/bwaltens/status/2013978366030864753" target="_blank"><u>ad</u></a> out this week that “Islam is not compatible with Western civilization” and vows to “stop the invasion” of Muslims. Reitz served less than a year in the Justice Department before launching his bid for attorney general. His opponent, state Sen. Mayes Middleton, also has an <a href="https://pdfweb.s3.amazonaws.com/scraped-ads/CR17061108716880789505.mp4" target="_blank"><u>ad</u></a> boasting that he’s running to “stop Sharia law” in Texas.</p> 
<p>And, most provocatively, Valentina Gomez <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/isiah-factor-uncensored/texas-congressional-candidate-sparks-controversy-quran-burning-video" target="_blank"><u>launched</u></a> her candidacy in Texas’ 31st Congressional District last year with a video showing her burning a Quran and declaring that “your daughters will be raped and your sons beheaded, unless we stop Islam once and for all.” Gomez, who is challenging President Donald Trump-endorsed Rep. John Carter (R-Texas), is a known conservative activist and provocateur who won just 8 percent of the primary vote when she ran for Missouri secretary of state last year.</p> 
<p>Anti-muslim sentiment in the U.S. grew out of the 9/11 terror attacks, which some Republicans used to rally their base for political gain. False rumors on the right that Barack Hussein Obama was a secret Muslim persisted <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2007/10/untraceable-e-mails-spread-obama-rumor-006314" target="_blank"><u>from his rise to the White House </u></a>and for years after. The planned construction of a mosque blocks from Ground Zero became a right-wing cause celebre early in his presidency, with multiple national Republican figures rallying against it.</p> 
<p>Trump intensified those feelings, first by elevating conspiracy theories that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S., then by repeatedly disparaging Muslims, pledging in his 2016 campaign to ban Muslims from entering the country and once he became president implementing travel bans against majority-Muslim countries. On Tuesday, Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115928297468422986" target="_blank"><u>reposted</u></a> a comment calling Islam a “cult.”</p> 
<p>But in recent years Islam hasn’t been as much of a focus within GOP campaigns — until now.</p> 
<p>The Texas ads come as Republicans nationwide have placed heightened scrutiny on CAIR, the largest Muslim advocacy group in the U.S. Sameeha Rizvi, CAIR Action Texas Policy and Advocacy Coordinator, called Cornyn’s ad “defamatory and despicable” and borne out of “desperation to compete with Ken Paxton’s anti-Muslim bigotry.”</p> 
<p>“CAIR is not going anywhere, American Muslims are not going anywhere, and our community will show its strength at the ballot box, God willing,” Rizvi said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Cornyn has introduced legislation seeking to revoke CAIR’s tax-exempt status. U.S. Rep Chip Roy, who is also in the Texas attorney general race, introduced a similar bill last year.</p> 
<p>When a super PAC on behalf of Cornyn launched an <a href="https://x.com/bradj_TX/status/2014319896671199443" target="_blank"><u>attack</u></a> against Paxton on Thursday, calling him “weird” and highlighting his divorce and alleged extramarital affairs, Paxton <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/2014344216508498073" target="_blank"><u>shot back</u></a> on X : “This desperate hail mary can't erase the fact that he [Cornyn] helped radical Islamic Afghans invade Texas and that his family's making a fortune securing visas for foreigners.”</p> 
<p>Paxton was referencing Cornyn’s past support for increasing the number of Special Immigrant Visas available to Afghans following the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of the country. Cornyn, who had once been supportive of the program,<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/republicans-drop-support-afghans-asylum-00697430" target="_blank"><u> reversed course</u></a> along with other Republicans late last year following the shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan who’d been granted asylum in the U.S., on the basis that the vetting of applicants was inadequate.</p> 
<p>Cornyn has responded to Paxton’s attacks with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZSeyNhSbPY" target="_blank"><u>digital ad</u></a> stating that Paxton talks tough but he’s actually “soft on radical Islam,” claiming that Paxton directed $2.5 million to resettle Afghan refugees in Texas, and his former attorney who defended him during impeachment proceedings now represents the East Plano Islamic Center.</p> 
<p>Several ads from different candidates in Texas use footage of the project from the East Plano Islamic Center, which would also feature a K-12 school and retail. Texas leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have said that the presence of the planned Muslim community raises national security concerns. The East Plano Islamic Center did not respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>“Texans overwhelmingly care about this – they're looking at their communities transform in radical ways,” said Reitz, the attorney general candidate.</p> 
<p>“You look at the number of mosques that have been built in Texas in just the last 10 to 20 years, and it's explosive,” he said. “It’s alarming for good reason, and I think that Republican voters in particular are looking for their public office holders to address it, and so it's such a pressing issue that I chose to really lean into this.”</p> 
<p>Cornyn’s ad declares that “Sharia law has no place in American courts or communities,” a reference to the development. Trump’s Justice Department also launched a civil rights investigation into the project last year after Cornyn requested the federal government to investigate “religious discrimination.”</p> 
<p>The project was already on the radar of Paxton, who had opened his first of several probes into its construction. In December, Paxton — whose candidacy is boosted by his reputation as an aggressive attorney general who frequently files lawsuits on behalf of MAGA causes — <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/05/texas-ken-paxton-epic-city-lawsuit/" target="_blank"><u>sued</u></a> the development for alleged securities fraud.</p> 
<p>The Justice Department quietly <a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-06-25/department-justice-ends-federal-probe-epic-city-mosque" target="_blank"><u>closed</u></a> its investigation last summer without filing any charges. But Abbott still went forward and signed multiple laws last year that banned “Sharia compounds” and designating CAIR and Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations. CAIR sued Texas in response, arguing the action was unconstitutional and defamatory.</p> 
<p>Paxton, in his official capacity as attorney general, <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/2015160530848121149" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> last week that the state comptroller can exclude private schools from the school voucher program if they violate the recently signed anti-terror laws, declaring that “Texans’ tax dollars should never fund Islamic terrorists or America’s enemies.”</p> 
<p><i>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated John Cornyn's level of involvement in legislation to revoke CAIR's tax-exempt status. He introduced it.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of another fatal shooting involving immigration agents, Trump administration and Minnesota officials are locked in a heated dispute over what exactly transpired and who’s to blame for the death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti.</p> 
<p>And they don’t just disagree in their interpretation of the events — they fundamentally differ on what exactly took place and what triggered it.</p> 
<p>Border Patrol agents <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minnesota-tim-walz-shooting-minneapolis-00745570" target="_blank">shot and killed</a> Pretti on Saturday during a tense encounter between observers and federal agents, a dynamic that has led to several violent interactions as the Trump administration escalates its nationwide immigration crackdown. His death comes less than a month after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/minneapolis-immigration-crackdown-shooting-00714034" target="_blank">fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good</a>. The scenes of the shootings were roughly two miles apart, and protesters flooded the streets after both.</p> 
<p>Amid conflicting accounts over the incident — including whether Pretti’s hand at any point during the incident was near his gun — video verified and analyzed by several media outlets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-federal-agents-video.html" target="_blank">including The New York Times</a>, show the item Pretti appeared to be holding was a phone he was using to film the scene before he attempted to help a woman who had been pushed to the ground by Border Patrol agents. According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/01/25/minneapolis-shooting-video-gun/" target="_blank">Washington Post analysis</a> of video footage, federal agents appear to have secured Pretti's gun just moments before an agent shot him.</p> 
<p>“What you see is someone brandishing a cellphone who is simply there with a cellphone helping someone up, a woman up, as his parents point out, when she had slipped,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/amy-klobuchar-says-ice-is-making-us-less-safe-after-another-fatal-mn-shooting-full-interview-256544325570" target="_blank">told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</a> “And so when I hear these officials from the Trump administration describe this video in ways that simply aren’t true, I just keep thinking, ‘Your eyes don’t lie.’”</p> 
<p>Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Sunday <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/bovino-border-patrol-agents-minneapolis-victims-00745702" target="_blank">accused Pretti of having “injected” himself</a> into a law enforcement investigation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti had committed a “felony” by impeding law enforcement. And Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blamed local state officials for what he called an “entirely avoidable” event.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/1f/1a/db0193cf4a55a6c5a4e24bf5d77b/ap26024812004514-edit.jpg" alt="People gather at the intersection of 27th Street and Nicollet Avenue, a block from the shooting." data-portal-copyright="Ben Hovland/Minnesota Public Radio via AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="26024812004514" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="People gather at the intersection of 27th Street and Nicollet Avenue, a block from the shooting."/><img src="https://static.politico.com/5d/ef/38ac589b42c58a09cdf599421d97/gettyimages-2258037569-edit.jpg" alt="A person is tackled by a federal agent amid protests following the shooting." data-portal-copyright="Brandon Bell/Getty Images" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="2258037569" data-licensor-name="Getty Images" data-title="A person is tackled by a federal agent amid protests following the shooting."/><img src="https://static.politico.com/26/92/d47baebe4fc3a3966708e045f536/ap26024793513012-edit.jpg" alt="Protesters react in the street along Nicollet Avenue on Jan 24." data-portal-copyright="Aaron Lavinsky/Minneapolis Star Tribune via AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="26024793513012" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Protesters react in the street along Nicollet Avenue on Jan 24."/><p>But Minnesota officials see a different story in the footage. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti was lawfully armed and exercising his constitutional rights, and Klobuchar told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the video shows him holding a cellphone and helping a woman up, not acting aggressively toward agents.</p> 
<p>Shortly after Saturday’s shooting, Noem offered one account of the incident: She said Pretti “approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun” and that he “violently resisted” when the officers attempted to disarm him.</p> 
<p>Noem then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91s4Iwa3K6Q" target="_blank">told Fox News on Sunday</a> that agents on Saturday “clearly feared for their lives” before shooting Pretti. She and other federal officials have claimed that Pretti was approaching agents with a gun.</p> 
<p>“We do know that he came to that scene and impeded a law enforcement operation, which is against federal law. It's a felony. When he did that, interacting with those agents when they tried to get him to disengage, he became aggressive and resisted them throughout that process,” Noem said. “These officers used their training, followed their protocols and were in fear of their lives and the people around them.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/a6/b1/0e9ee652414ebde1e7edfc87edda/gettyimages-2258012002-edit.jpg" alt="Shortly after Saturday’s shooting, Kristi Noem offered one account of the incident: She said Pretti “approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun” and that he “violently resisted” when the officers attempted to disarm him." data-portal-copyright="Al Drago/Getty Images" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="2258012002" data-licensor-name="Getty Images" data-title="Shortly after Saturday’s shooting, Kristi Noem offered one account of the incident: She said Pretti “approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun” and that he “violently resisted” when the officers attempted to disarm him."/><img src="https://static.politico.com/77/a1/33171be6435c9da3fae973e1d3e3/ap26010606785601-edit.jpg" alt="Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti was lawfully armed and exercising his constitutional rights." data-portal-copyright="Jen Golbeck/AP" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="26010606785601" data-licensor-name="AP" data-title="Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti was lawfully armed and exercising his constitutional rights."/><p>Despite Noem’s claim that the agents feared for their lives, O’Hara, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/minneapolis-police-chief-brian-ohara-says-people-have-had-enough-after-border-patrol-shooting/" target="_blank">speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation”</a> on Sunday morning, said he had seen no evidence Pretti brandished a weapon during the encounter.</p> 
<p>“You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm,” O’Hara said during an interview with host Margaret Brennan. “And there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota, and everything that we see that we are aware of shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions.”</p> 
<p>But in an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Bovino said a person’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers.”</p> 
<p>Noem seemingly suggested the fact that Pretti possessed “a gun and ammunition, rather than a sign” meant the scene was a “violent riot.”</p>

<p>“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” <a href="https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/2015093164999119352?s=20" target="_blank">Walz posted on X</a>. “The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”</p> 
<p>“This administration and everyone involved in this operation should be reflecting. They should be reflecting right now and asking themselves, what exactly are you accomplishing?” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, said at a Saturday press conference. “If the goal was to achieve peace and safety, this is doing exactly the opposite. If the goal was to achieve calm and prosperity, this is doing exactly the opposite.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new generation of Black Democrats is running in the midterms, aiming to inject a younger vision into an aging Congressional Black Caucus. And in some cases, that means primarying incumbents.</p> 
<p>The wave of new candidates comes amid an identity crisis for the Democratic Party, which has splintered along generational and ideological lines as the party searches for new leaders in the second Trump era, both for this November and the open presidential race in two years.</p> 
<p>“This is a new moment that requires different ideas, requires new energy and new perspectives and you cannot be a part of the system for 40 years and also be the one who's going to change it for the next 40,” said Tennessee state Rep. Justin Pearson, 31, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/justin-j-pearson-to-challenge-tennessee-rep-steve-cohen-in-dem-primary-00597567" target="_blank">who launched his primary challenge</a> to 76-year-old Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51856" data-person-id="51856">Steve Cohen</a> (D-Tenn.) last year. “You've done the best that you could, and it's time for other folks to be able to do the best that they can for the present and for the future.”</p> 
<p>Young Black candidates say they’re motivated to run due to rising racial tensions, redistricting and the possibility of <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/08/08/its-been-60-years-since-the-voting-rights-act-was-signed-will-it-make-it-to-61-00500390" target="_blank">an end to the Voting Rights Act</a> — and what they describe as an inadequate response from older generations that are fighting past battles.</p> 
<p>“Our generation recognizes the fierce urgency of now,” Pearson said.</p> 
<p>The CBC has grown exponentially since its establishment in 1971, currently boasting a historic 62 members — the largest of any of the affinity caucuses. But the average age of CBC members is 60 years old, and some of the oldest House Democrats are members.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51325" data-person-id="51325">Jim Clyburn</a>, 85, has represented South Carolina for more than 30 years and plans on running again. At 88 years old, D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton has not ruled out running for reelection, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/10/congress/eleanor-holmes-norton-reelection-00397248" target="_blank">despite growing concerns about her age</a>. And 87-year-old Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51664" data-person-id="51664">Maxine Waters</a> (D-Calif.), who was first elected in 1990, said she <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/15/house-democrats-age-members-reelection-biden" target="_blank">also plans on running for reelection</a> this year.</p> 
<p>These long tenures have started to worry some new candidates, they said in interviews.</p> 
<p>“When I was born in 1992, this was the poorest district in the poorest state in the country,” said Evan Turnage, who is primarying 77-year-old Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51647" data-person-id="51647">Bennie Thompson</a> (D-Miss.). “Congressman Thompson was elected in ’93 and now today, I'm 33, and this is still the poorest district in the poorest state in the country.”</p> 
<p>Turnage — a former senior staffer to Sens. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> of New York and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/140963" data-person-id="140963">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts — said these long-serving members have “failed” younger generations for too long.</p> 
<p>“Just because you've been around the block for 30 years doesn't mean you're delivering results for the district, doesn't mean you're delivering results for your constituents,” Turnage said.</p> 
<p>In a statement, Thompson said he has spent his entire career encouraging young people “to make a difference in the world.”</p> 
<p>“If this is how Mr. Turnage chooses to make a difference in Mississippi’s 2nd Congressional District, that's his choice," Thompson said.</p> 
<p>The younger Black candidates — and current lawmakers — have generally pushed more progressive policies in their campaigns than CBC members who have served for decades. They've had a heavy focus on issues they say are of most concern to those in their generations, such as the cost of living and education.</p> 
<p>"The Democratic Party has to adapt in order to survive. That work starts right now," said Pearson, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/12/second-tennessee-state-lawmaker-reinstated-00091715" target="_blank">gained nationwide fame in 2023 as a member of the "Tennessee Three”</a> after he was expelled from, and then reelected to, the state Legislature for leading a gun safety protest on the state House floor.</p> 
<p>"Black folks in this country are still suffering disproportionately in every single category, and without leadership to elevate those concerns, those worries, those issues in a meaningful way, we're never going to see that change," Pearson added.</p> 
<p>He is challenging Cohen, who is white, in a majority-Black district based in Memphis that Cohen has represented for decades. During his 2007 campaign, Cohen expressed interest in joining the CBC, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2007/01/black-caucus-whites-not-allowed-002389" target="_blank">but caucus members quickly shut that down</a>.</p> 
<p>Cohen said in an interview that his tenure in Congress is actually a strength.</p> 
<p>“I know the issues and I know the problems, I know the people,” said Cohen. “The way you get legislation passed hasn't changed, really, in the 40 years I've been here. Some people think it's about getting a megaphone and hollering or making some kind of a fuss, and I've done some of that in my younger days, and I still like to occasionally … but it's a matter of having friends, having relationships, and being able to get the majority of votes to pass the bills. And I've done that all my life.”</p> 
<p>The CBC has begun to see younger legislators enter their ranks in recent years. Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/461974" data-person-id="461974">Gabe Amo</a>, 38, made history in 2023 when he was elected as Rhode Island’s first Black representative. And in 2022, at the age of 25, Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/411928" data-person-id="411928">Maxwell Frost </a>became the first Gen Z CBC member elected to Congress.</p> 
<p>“Our movement — from the civil rights era to the birth of the CBC itself — was born from the energy and courage of young people to stand up and do the right thing,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51521" data-person-id="51521">Gregory Meeks</a> (D-N.Y.), chair of the CBC’s political arm, in a statement. “Our caucus today represents the breadth and depth of our community — from every corner of America — and folks whose families have been here for generations, those who are immigrants, queer, disabled, and more women and young people than ever before.”</p> 
<p>The CBC PAC has already endorsed some young candidates this cycle, including California’s Lauren Babb and Arkansas’ Chris Jones. It’s likely the PAC will also endorse Adrian Boafo, 31, according to a person familiar with the matter who was granted anonymity to discuss private matters, who is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/steny-hoyer-retirement-00715790" target="_blank">running to succeed</a> 86-year-old Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51438" data-person-id="51438">Steny Hoyer</a>. </p> 
<p>But the PAC this year also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/15/congressional-black-caucus-espaillat-primary-00728543?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">endorsed 71-year-old incumbent</a> Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/193043" data-person-id="193043">Adriano Espaillat </a>(D-N.Y.) — who identifies as Afro Latino, currently chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has had a bumpy relationship with the CBC — over his 32-year-old primary challenger, Darializa Avila Chevalier.</p> 
<p>As the age gap between caucus members and voters grows, an influx of fresh faces will be vital to regaining voters’ support for Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterms, said 25-year-old Courtney McClain, who is running for a red House seat in South Carolina.</p> 
<p>“Within the party in general, we've had an issue of connecting with younger voters, and especially with young men,” said McClain, referring to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/behind-trumps-2024-victory-a-more-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-voter-coalition/" target="_blank">15 percent of Black men</a> who supported President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. “I really think a lot of people are more apt to vote if they can see themselves in the candidate as opposed to someone who has been there for many years.”</p> 
<p>But these young Black candidates still hold a deep appreciation for the caucus, despite their concerns around age.</p> 
<p>Turnage said he’d “love” to be a member of the CBC. Pearson called the caucus an "extraordinary institution.” And McClain — a onetime CBC Foundation intern and a fellow with the CBC Institute last year — said she would “definitely” like to be a member.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, McClain said, the CBC needs young members if they hope to actually address the challenges facing the next generation.</p> 
<p>“The legislation that's being passed, a lot of the people that are currently in office won't even be impacted by it, say, in the next 20 years,” McClain said. “But my generation will.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Republicans are one step closer to finalizing plans for a midterm convention later this year.</p> 
<p>The Republican National Committee approved a rule change during its winter meeting on Friday that would allow the party to hold a convention during a midterm election year.</p> 
<p>"I'm incredibly excited about the possibility of hosting midterm convention to highlight what President Trump and Republicans have been able to accomplish this year," RNC Chairman Joe Gruters said after the rule change was adopted. "If the president wants us to host a convention to highlight the great work this administration has done for the American people, we are doing the work now and will be ready to act when that time comes."</p> 
<p>The amendment was approved at the RNC’s winter meeting with no objections. An unusually high number of RNC members had already left the meeting to catch early flights ahead of winter storms bearing down on much of the country by the time the vote was brought up.</p> 
<p>The rule authorizes the RNC to “conduct a special ceremonial convention between presidential conventions, such as a midterm convention,” said Bill O’Brien, the national committeeman from New Hampshire.</p> 
<p>National party conventions have typically been held only during presidential elections in the modern era. But President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/trump-says-the-gop-will-hold-a-midterm-convention-00566778" target="_blank"><u>announced in September</u></a> that the party would be holding a “Midterm Convention,” leaving the party scrambling to execute.</p> 
<p>The event would give Republicans an opportunity to message the administration’s wins and platform candidates in battleground races across the country as they fight to hold onto congressional control.</p> 
<p>Democrats, who held a series of midterm-year national conventions in the 1970s, are also flirting with the possibility. At the Democratic National Committee’s winter meetings in Los Angeles last month, officials from Nebraska and Utah were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/13/dnc-democratic-national-committee-hope-00689938" target="_blank"><u>among those jockeying to host the potential event</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Republicans have not yet announced where their convention will be held or when, though Nevada GOP leaders are <a href="https://nevadanewsandviews.com/a-solid-bet-bring-gop-midterm-convention-to-vegas-baby/" target="_blank"><u>pushing for Las Vegas to host</u></a>.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As he increasingly flirts with a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/21/politics/mark-kelly-pentagon-profile" target="_blank">2028 presidential run</a>, Mark Kelly is winning friends up and down the ballot — if not influencing his Trump administration enemies.</p> 
<p>In an effort to help flip the House and Senate in 2026, Kelly has strategically used his star turn as President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s Public Enemy No. 1 to ramp up his giving and fundraising to competitive candidates, party committees and state parties to the tune of nearly $5 million last year, according to figures shared exclusively with POLITICO.</p> 
<p>Since Trump in late November attacked the Arizona senator and other national security Democrats with a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115582703277798715" target="_blank">Truth Social post</a> accusing them of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH,” one of the biggest questions in political circles has been just how much Kelly would benefit from Trump fashioning him into a foil. That post has raised Kelly’s profile, boosted further by Hegseth announcing an <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/12/congress/mark-kelly-pete-hegseth-lawsuit-00722382" target="_blank">investigation into Kelly</a>.</p> 
<p>While Kelly’s total fundraising numbers aren't yet available, what he raised and gave away will likely only be a fraction. His moves thus far — and the spotlight that Trump has shone on him — have positioned him to be a key fundraiser for Democrats in 2026, and offer him a platform to build out a 2028 base.</p> 
<p>Kelly made more than $1 million in direct contributions and transfers to Democrats across the country, bringing his total direct contributions to more than $1.4 million for 2025. That includes $100,000 each to the DCCC and the DSCC and more than $280,000 to the DNC and state parties combined. As for the Senate, the DSCC vice chair has raised or contributed more than $2.3 million for the committee since the start of last year. He also raised $1 million for other Democrats in the fourth quarter alone by signing emails, text messages and ads.</p> 
<p>Kelly also made direct contributions to approximately 30 state parties, including in potential early nominating 2028 states like Iowa, Michigan, South Carolina and New Hampshire. He also made two trips to South Carolina and one trip to Michigan, along with travel to Nevada.</p> 
<p>“There’s definitely a message there that resonates with Nevada voters across the board,” Nevada Democrats Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno told POLITICO, adding that Kelly drew a diverse crowd to the event he attended and praising his contribution to the state party. “So yes, I know there'll be a number of people that will probably throw their hat in the ring, but he has definitely sparked the interest of some Nevada voters.”</p> 
<p>That's not to mention off-year election trips for Democrats in North Carolina, New Jersey and Virginia. “Senator Kelly is working overtime to support Democrats running in tough races because he knows that taking back the House and Senate is critical to holding Trump accountable and delivering relief from rising costs for American families,” said Jacob Peters, a Kelly spokesperson.</p> 
<p>Kelly’s chits make it clear that attention from Trump can be a major boon for a potential 2028 presidential candidate. But more than anything, Kelly’s rising national profile, much like that of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's last year, shows Trump has a unique ability to elevate foils. Trump has a great deal of power to pare the Democratic field.</p> 
<p>“I’m sure that will be something we want him to do” as the 2028 presidential race gets closer, one Republican close to the White House told Playbook, though they noted that it’s still early.</p> 
<p>But do Republicans who want to keep the White House think he's making smart bets by elevating the Newsoms and Kellys of the opposition?</p> 
<p>“Newsom is a perfect foil because his record is so horrendous,” said Dave Carney, the veteran New Hampshire GOP political consultant. “He will tell you whatever he thinks you want to hear.” One minute, Carney said, “he sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger — a moderate Republican. But then he gets beat up from the left, and he, you know, scurries back there.” As for Kelly? “Kelly's a press thing,” Carney said. “He's not a real thing.”</p> 
<p>There’s at least one candidate who Carney does <i>not</i> want to see Trump elevate: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.</p> 
<p>“He's the first candidate in the history of America that I'm aware of where his vice presidential search in not being picked has helped him,” Carney said, citing Shapiro’s fundraising ability. “There’s a lot of assets he has.”</p> 
<p>The drawback for Democrats vying for the nomination: Trump’s ire and retribution could lead to a rolling and unpredictable flavor of the month for some time leading up to 2028. Or, as Carney put it: “The president has the capacity — demonstrated over time — that he can beat the shit out of more than one person at a time.”</p>

But young Trump supporters may not be all that enamored with him as they weigh their 2028 options.</p> 
<p>In a focus group of nine young men who supported Trump in 2024, conducted Monday by Longwell Partners and shared with POLITICO, they showed tepid enthusiasm about the vice president and suggested he is too bridled by the baggage of Trump's second term.</p> 
<p>“I feel like it's just time for someone new, especially for the Republican Party,” said Alexandre M., a voter in Maryland, who raised concerns about Trumps’s handling of the Epstein files, “because JD Vance was also pushing that as well.”</p> 
<p>When the 18- to 24-year-olds were asked who else they would like to see as potential candidates in 2028, they named Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Florida gubernatorial candidate James Fishback. When the moderator asked who wants to see Vance as the GOP nominee, just one of the nine raised their hand — and even he later signaled he is still unsure of his support.</p> 
<p>Others in the group raised concerns about electability as well as Vance’s changing views.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think Vance can win, because I think he's too connected to the current political establishment in Washington, which I think has a very negative approval rating right now,” said Sam Z., a voter in Minnesota. “If you look at what he was about in 2018, 2019, 2020, and you look at what he's about now, it's very, very different. … Somebody younger running in office would be awesome. So that's the one thing I wouldn't mind for Vance. But overall, I just don't think [he] can win. I think he's kind of flip-flopped on a lot of issues.”</p> 
<p>The one voter who said he’d be open to Vance in 2028 said he liked Vance’s experience. “I think because he already is a VP, like he has more experience than most people will, which puts him at an advantage,” said Ruben T., a voter in Georgia.</p> 
<p>Vance wasn’t the only topic where these voters split from the traditional party line.</p> 
<p>Asked about U.S. support for Israel, five said they felt the U.S. supports Israel too much and four said the right amount. None said too little.</p> 
<p>Some mentioned conspiracy theories — like Candace Owens’ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/16/candace-owens-maga-conspiracy-charlie-kirk/" target="_blank">assertion that Charlie Kirk was assassinated by the Israeli government</a> — for steering their belief that the U.S. should support Israel less.</p> 
<p>“I don't know how factual some of this stuff is, but after seeing a lot of things after Charlie Kirk's death and with Candace Owens’ private investigation, I kind of started to notice of, like, Israel was kind of always a big talking point with the Republicans,” said Richard B., a voter in Pennsylvania. “I personally have an issue with it.”</p> 
<p>Some of them spoke in free-speech terms, through a humanitarian lens or from an America First perspective. “I just don't believe that death is justifiable in any way, and of course, Israel is responsible for many deaths,” Matteo R. in Illinois said.</p> 
<p>“I think we should be more focused on eliminating problems that we have in our own country, versus one that's pretty far across the world,” said Sam M., a voter in New Mexico.</p> 
<p>That domestic-first approach applied to Trump’s flirtations with Greenland. When asked, “Who would like to see the U.S. buy Greenland?” none raised their hands.</p> 
<p>“No other president has ever said that,” said Mukeesh S., in California. “It's been part of Denmark. I think we should just respect it and leave it, and focus on what's actually happening inside the nation.”</p> 
<p>Dillon, a voter from Rhode Island, added: “I think it's kind of an unnecessary thing to do right now, and it's not what our resources could best be used on.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump since his return to office last year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argues it’s a sign of Newsom’s weakness.</p> 
<p>“I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up, some of these things he’s saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo,” Bessent said in an interview Thursday with POLITICO’s Dasha Burns for “The Conversation."</p> 
<p>Trump’s top economic adviser said that Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate and longstanding Trump foe, has a “brain the size of a walnut” and that he knows “less about economics than” former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he clarified is “a terrible place to be in.”</p> 
<p>The attacks are the latest in a simmering feud between Trump and Newsom, which escalated over the course of the week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Newsom was scheduled to speak at USA House on Wednesday as part of the conference, but his appearance was cancelled at the last minute. Newsom <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/21/newsom-administration-alleges-state-department-pressure-in-davos-cancellation-00738966" target="_blank">blamed the Trump administration</a>, but an organizer said they decided to focus on programming with business leaders.</p> 
<p>At Davos, Newsom met with world leaders, as did Bessent and Trump.</p> 
<p>Upon arriving, Newsom urged European leaders not to cave to Trump’s demands over a wide-range of foreign policy issues. In a panel at the conference, the California governor brandished a pair of kneepads bearing Trump’s signature to mock world leaders he feels have been overly accommodating of the president.</p> 
<p>Bessent dismissed the “strange things” Newsom has said to attack Trump, including the knee pad stunt and a comment in which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/gavin-newsom-world-leaders-pathetic-donald-trump/" target="_blank">Newsom analogized Trump to a dinosaur</a>.</p> 
<p>“To say strange things like President Trump is a tyrannosaurus rex, what the hell does that mean? I can say Gavin Newsom is a brontosaurus with a brain the size of a walnut,” Bessent said. “And, if you brought the knee pads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros.”</p> 
<p>Bessent also defended the Trump administration from criticisms that they’re out of touch with the economic concerns of Americans. During a panel in Davos, Bessent said the administration wants to protect the investments of “mom and pop” retirees who may have purchased “5, 10, 12 homes.”</p> 
<p>In his defense, Bessent took another opportunity to swipe at Newsom, who he labeled “Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken” during a speech earlier at the conference.</p> 
<p>“I think it was a Dem governor, Newsom, who made the comment of being out of touch. What does he know? Like, his father worked for the Getty family,” Bessent said. “I actually think he knows less about economics than Kamala Harris, which is a terrible place to be in.”</p> 
<p>The full interview with Bessent will <a href="https://www.politico.com/podcasts/the-conversation" target="_blank">air on "The Conversation."</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Democrats voted overwhelmingly Thursday to block additional funding for ICE, a remarkable shift from when dozens of them voted to expand the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement authority just one year ago — and a sign of how quickly the political ground has moved since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p> 
<p>Just seven Democrats voted for the Homeland Security spending bill that included billions for Immigration and Customs Enforcement: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine, Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Don Davis of North Carolina. All represent tough terrain — Trump carried all of their districts but Gillen’s, which he lost by just over one point.</p> 
<p>Other Democrats, incensed by an ICE agent’s shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, voted against the bill — including many who voted exactly one year ago to pass the Laken Riley Act that allows for the detention of undocumented immigrants accused of certain crimes.</p> 
<p>One of them, Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), a top GOP target in the midterms from a district Trump narrowly carried in 2024, argued this vote was different.</p> 
<p>“What we have seen time and again is ICE has blatantly violated our Constitution and our law, whether you’re talking about the shooting of a young mother to sending a five year old thousands of miles away to entice his father to turn himself in — this type of shit is not American,” Lee said in an interview Thursday. “ICE has plenty of money … I can’t in good conscience give them any more money until we get some type of guardrails.”</p> 
<p>Even the Democrats who voted for the funding were sharply critical of ICE.</p> 
<p>“I hate what ICE is doing in my district and across the country. It's atrocious. It's appalling. We should find ways to defund those operations in a surgical way,” Gonzalez said in a brief interview, adding that he supported the bill because it also included funding for Coast Guard and FEMA operations. “But voting no, just to make a statement, could have its own repercussions.”</p> 
<p>The House passed the DHS funding bill 220 to 207.</p> 
<p>Democrats’ near-united stand against the bill comes amid building opposition to Trump’s mass deportation campaign. A 49 percent plurality of voters in a new POLITICO poll conducted Jan. 16 to 19 said the effort — including Trump’s widespread deployment of ICE agents across the U.S. — is too aggressive.</p> 
<p>“The shift is dramatic. And I think the reason for the shift is: Last year the debate in the country was about getting control of the borders and out-of-control immigration. Now the entire situation is about ICE itself and its behavior,” Mark Longabaugh, a veteran Democratic strategist, said of the party’s recalibration on immigration.</p> 
<p>Amid the growing public furor over ICE’s hardline tactics, congressional Democrats had demanded that any new Homeland Security funding come with more guardrails.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/20/congress-clinches-funding-deal-for-dhs-pentagon-domestic-agencies-00735698" target="_blank"><u>bill most of them voted against Thursday funds ICE at $10 billion through the rest of the fiscal year</u></a> that ends in September, while cutting funding for removal and enforcement operations by $115 million and <a href="https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/appropriations-committees-release-homeland-security-funding-bill" target="_blank"><u>Border Patrol funding by $1.8 billion</u></a>. It also included some Democratic demands: decreasing the number of detention beds by 5,500, providing $20 million each for body cameras for agents and independent oversight of DHS detention facilities, and directing the department to give officers more training on diffusing conflict while interacting with the public.</p> 
<p>It does not include other items Democrats pushed for, however, such as banning agents from wearing masks during operations, requiring judicial warrants, preventing DHS from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens and blocking the department from using other agencies’ personnel for immigration enforcement.</p> 
<p>The Democrats who voted in favor of the funding bill argued it was preferable to the alternative — giving Trump what Cuellar described as a “blank check” to carry out his hardline immigration agenda “virtually unchecked.”</p> 
<p>And some expressed concerns about ramifications for their districts if other agencies who receive their funding through DHS were cut off. Davis warned of the potential consequences of lapsed FEMA and Coast Guard funding in his home state of North Carolina that has been battered by storms and floods in recent years.</p> 
<p>“Obviously we should have the honest conversations about warrants. We should have the honest conversations about taking off the masks,” Davis said Thursday. But “if we can't consistently predict when disasters are coming our way, then we're leaving populations of people vulnerable.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rahm Emanuel said Wednesday he wants to institute a mandatory retirement age of 75 for the president and across branches of government, a pipe dream of a call from the potential White House hopeful that would bar him from serving a second term as president.</p> 
<p>“You’re 75 years old: done,” the former Chicago mayor and ambassador to Japan said Wednesday at a Center for American Progress event. “And that would be in the legislative branch, it’d be in the executive branch — including the Cabinet — and it’d be also in the Supreme Court, and all the federal courts.”</p> 
<p>Emanuel, who is 66, would be 69 when sworn into office if he runs for and wins the 2028 presidential contest. He would be 73 at the start of his second term, and would, by his own standard, be unable to serve all four years. He acknowledged this when pressed by POLITICO at a Christian Science Monitor roundtable Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>“I know where I am in my age. Of course it would apply to me,” Emanuel said. “You can’t say ‘here’s what I want to do to change Washington, one of the things I want to do’ — but I get an exemption because I bought it beforehand.’”</p> 
<p>His standard would make Donald Trump, 79, ineligible to continue serving as president. And it would have barred Joe Biden, under whom Emanuel served as ambassador to Japan, from serving his single term. It would also impact the 17 senators and 45 members of the House who are currently 75 or older.</p> 
<p>“You can’t serve in the armed forces, you can’t serve in private sector jobs” at 75, Emanuel said. “Go work on your golf swing, it’s not that good to begin with.”</p> 
<p>Emanuel is reigniting a debate that raged throughout the last presidential election as Biden, then 81, and Trump, then 78, each sought a second term — and as questions about Biden’s mental and physical stamina crescendoed. And it’s simmered for years on Capitol Hill as lawmakers confront mental decline and even death within their ranks.</p> 
<p>Age limits are popular with voters who have balked in recent years at the advancing ages of the nation’s presidential contenders, lawmakers and Supreme Court justices. Roughly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/04/most-americans-favor-maximum-age-limits-for-federal-elected-officials-supreme-court-justices/" target="_blank"><u>two-thirds of Americans support age limits</u></a> for federal elected officials and the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/10/politicians-age-limits-joe-biden-mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank"><u>polls show</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Emanuel, a former representative, said he would push for legislation to set the limit rather than attempt a constitutional amendment. (The Constitution sets a minimum age for members of Congress but not a maximum, and establishes no limits for the Supreme Court.) It’s not clear whether that legislation itself would be constitutional — and could be a tough sell in a Congress where the median age for senators is 64.</p> 
<p>Emanuel framed the age limit as part of a broader call for “comprehensive ethics, lobbying [and] anti-corruption reform” across the federal government that he said should include a crackdown on lawmakers and judges <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/supreme-court-justices-millions-dollars-gifts-clarence-thomas.html" target="_blank"><u>taking gifts</u></a> and stock trading. The veteran Democratic strategist said his party should be hammering that message as part of a midterms platform that also includes raising the minimum wage and instituting a bill of rights for ratepayers.</p> 
<p>“You have a president of the United States, in my view, that has expanded, deepened the swamp. Our job is to drain the swamp as Democrats,” Emanuel said, turning Trump’s trademark phrase against him. “There’s not a day that goes by that you don’t read a story about either his family, [Commerce Secretary Howard] Lutnick’s family or [Special Envoy Steve] Witkoff’s family making money.”</p> 
<p>Emanuel’s choice of 75 may have been influenced by his brother, Ezekiel Emanuel, a former White House adviser and oncologist who <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/" target="_blank"><u>wrote in 2014</u></a> that he did not want to live past 75. In that piece, he wrote that his view “drives my brothers crazy.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Julia Letlow announced her primary challenge to Sen. Bill Cassidy on Tuesday, just days after President Donald Trump lent his endorsement in the race.</p> 
<p>The entrance of Letlow, a Louisiana Republican who has served in Congress since 2021, is a major blow to Cassidy, who was already fending off another MAGA-aligned challenger in a state Trump carried by 22 points in 2024.</p> 
<p>“My parents taught me well. They taught me that when the Lord opens a door, you don’t walk through it — you run. It's an honor to share with you today that I’m officially announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate,” Letlow said at an annual business event with other state leaders in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to two people who attended the event. </p> 
<p>Cassidy said in a statement Letlow had called him beforehand.</p> 
<p>"She said she respected me and that I had done a good job," he said. "I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election."</p> 
<p>Trump upended the primary in the Republican state over the weekend when he preemptively endorsed Letlow. “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115913724519885202" target="_blank">Trump wrote on Truth Social</a>.</p> 
<p>Letlow said that she was “honored to have President Trump’s endorsement and trust,” but did not immediately launch her bid after receiving the president’s public backing.</p> 
<p>Cassidy, seeking a third term in the Senate, has drawn criticism from Trump after voting to convict Trump in his 2021 impeachment trial over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. He has also clashed with the administration at times on health care, though he was a key vote to confirm Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last year.</p> 
<p>While Cassidy has maintained he will win, Trump’s endorsement of Letlow is a serious blow to his chances. Cassidy has told fellow GOP senators that top White House officials promised him they would stay neutral in the race, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/04/bill-cassidy-trump-rfk-jr-louisiana-endorsement-00543192" target="_blank">as POLITICO reported in September</a>.</p> 
<p>Trump’s endorsement — and Letlow’s entrance into the race — also adds a new complication for Senate GOP leadership, which has backed Cassidy. </p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune campaigned with Cassidy in Lousiana late last week and privately encouraged Trump to support him during a call Friday. And Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 GOP leader, said Tuesday he has been supporting Cassidy "from the beginning."</p> 
<p>"We’re going to do everything we can to build the majority," Barrasso said when asked how much of a "headache" Trump's endorsement is for Republicans.</p> 
<p>Letlow first entered Congress after her husband, Rep.-elect Luke Letlow (R-La.), died of COVID before entering office, and in her Tuesday speech compared her career trajectory to that of former Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), who won her House seat after her husband, Rep. Hale Boggs (D-La.), died in office.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least a half-dozen states applied to be in the early nominating window for 2028’s Democratic presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/25/dnc-2028-primary-states-iowa-new-hampshire-00521488" target="_blank"><u>kicking off a contentious battle</u></a> for securing an influential perch inside the primary calendar.</p> 
<p>The usual suspects — New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and Michigan, who made up the early states in Democrats’ 2024 primary calendar, though not in the order set out by the Democratic National Committee — are all back, per their state parties. So is Iowa, hoping to reinsert itself into the process after it was bounced four years ago. Georgia also applied.</p> 
<p>Virginia and North Carolina are both seriously considering applying, according to three people familiar with the state’s thinking and granted anonymity to describe private conversations, ahead of the deadline later Friday. Other wild-card states may also still apply before the cutoff, and the DNC declined to comment on which states have applied so far.</p> 
<p>The presidential nominating calendar — which states are in it and in what order — will affect how Democratic presidential candidates tailor their strategies heading into a wide-open 2028 primary. It would inform which states to prioritize, where to place staff, how much money each state will cost a campaign — all calculations that have shaped previous presidential primaries. Unsurprisingly, Democrats have a lot of opinions on how that should go.</p> 
<p>“The day after the 2026 midterms, people are going to launch into action, so the window needs to be set,” said Jay Parmley, executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party. “It’s possible they not only start coming, but they could start putting staff on the ground the earliest we’ve ever seen.”</p> 
<p>The process to set the process could stretch deep into 2026. Members of the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee charged with setting the calendar are expected to winnow the field of applicants at their Jan. 31 meeting, according to three DNC members involved in the process and granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.</p> 
<p>States will then be invited to make presentations to the committee later that spring. One DNC member said they expected the calendar to be set over the summer and voted on by the full DNC at its August meeting, but the timeline could easily shift later into 2026.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/02/democrats-biden-2024-primaries-00071943" target="_blank"><u>Shaking up the presidential nominating calendar started back in 2022</u></a>, after Iowa’s disastrous 2020 caucuses and accusations that the early states didn’t reflect the party’s racial diversity. Then-President Joe Biden — ahead of what was at the time expected to be a staid primary process — elevated South Carolina even earlier in the order, cut Iowa and added Michigan to the calendar.</p> 
<p>Now, DNC officials have pledged to start the process from scratch. They’ve said they want all four regions of the country represented, as well as a potential extra state, to vote ahead of Super Tuesday. DNC members have also emphasized whether states represent racial and geographic diversity, the cost effectiveness for smaller presidential candidates and the general election competitiveness of the states.</p> 
<p>“The early states should be swing states,” said Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. “The investments we’re making on the ground [in the primary] are beneficial to the general.”</p> 
<p>That’s led to two fights resurfacing: For some states, it’s about just getting into the window; others want to be first. Think Iowa, Michigan and Georgia for those hoping to be invited to the early window party. All three are vying to either return or get into it for the first time.</p> 
<p>For Georgia, the path is more complicated. Democrats don’t currently hold the governor’s mansion or the Legislature and almost assuredly won’t have a trifecta after the midterms, meaning they’d need GOP cooperation to move up their primary should the state be selected. But Georgia Democrats are confident they could adjust their date.</p> 
<p>“Even if there is a Republican [governor],” after the 2026 election, “Republicans in the past have very much wanted theirs to be earlier as well,” said Charlie Bailey, the Georgia Democratic Party’s chair. “All the logic in the world points to Republicans wanting to move up in their process for their own reasons.”</p> 
<p>The second group — including Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina — are all pushing for the influential first-place slot. Nevada, in particular, has been aggressive in their lobbying push of DNC members. New Hampshire released a memo last fall, emphasizing they wouldn’t just rely on a “tradition” argument to maintain their first-in-the-nation status.</p> 
<p>South Carolina, too, said it wants to keep its spot, after Biden elevated them to the coveted first official spot. (New Hampshire, however, still held its primary first in 2024 despite threats from the DNC, as required under state law.)</p> 
<p>“Our hope is that we maintain the position, but, of course, we’ll fully respect the decision and wishes of the RBC, even if we are unhappy,” said Parmley, the South Carolinian.</p> 
<p>In a statement, RBC Co-chairs Jim Roosevelt and Minyon Moore said: “The Rules and Bylaws Committee is committed to running a rigorous, efficient, and fair process that will deliver the strongest presidential nominee for our party. We look forward to continuing that work later this month when the committee begins consideration of state applications to hold their contest in the early window of the 2028 Democratic presidential nominating process.”</p>
