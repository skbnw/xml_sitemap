      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK — Just as Democrats are finding their footing by focusing on affordability, their differences on Israel are threatening to tear them apart.</p> 
<p>Spurred by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/10/03/how-americans-view-the-israel-hamas-conflict-2-years-into-the-war/" target="_blank"><u>polling that shows</u></a> support for the Jewish state slipping among voters nationally, congressional challengers are lining up across the country to take on stalwart Israel supporters in an attempt to energize left-leaning voters. But the deluge of Democratic primaries being waged in some part over this issue also threatens to exhaust resources, muddy the party’s messaging and bloody candidates ahead of the general election.</p> 
<p>Pro-Israel Democrats believe supporters should mobilize with urgency to confront this crop of challengers.</p> 
<p>“The main, centrist Democratic Party as a whole is doing a terrible job managing this whole process,” said Mark Botnick, a former advisor to ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who contributed more than $10 million to efforts opposing Zohran Mamdani’s successful mayoral campaign. “That’s not to say the Israeli government has made it easy for them. It’s fine for someone to be against their policies, but it’s very different to be against the existence of the Jewish state, which in my eyes is antisemitism. The party has done an abysmal job of getting up and saying that.”</p> 
<p>Next year’s midterms are pivotal: Democrats locked out of power in Washington need only net three House seats and four in the Senate — a tougher task — in order to seize control over either chamber.</p> 
<p>Pro-Israel incumbents are facing challenges in New Jersey and New York, while primary battles in Michigan and Illinois are also being prepped by pro-Palestinian candidates. The coming contests have put Democrats on edge. As they try to win back power in the closely divided House, they are desperate to avoid messy primary races.</p> 
<p>The American Israel Public Affairs Committee is mobilizing too — months before the first vote is cast — to identify potential incumbents who need shoring up as the primary fields take shape.</p> 
<p>“Our 6 million grassroots members understand the stakes in the upcoming midterms, and that is why they are deeply motivated and engaged to help elect pro-Israel candidates and defeat detractors,” said AIPAC spokesperson Marshall Wittmann.</p> 
<p>The Democratic Majority For Israel’s political action committee got an early jump on the cycle as well — so far endorsing 26 Democratic House incumbents across the country, an initial slate that includes lawmakers in Illinois, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The group’s board chair, Brian Romick, called it a “critical moment for the U.S.-Israel relationship.”</p> 
<p>Primary bids fueled by opposition to Israel are complicating Democrats’ path to victory next year, despite signs of increasingly favorable political terrain following wins in Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. The efforts underscore the yawning chasm facing Democrats over Israel more than two years since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas and a devastating war in Gaza that has killed thousands of Palestinians. Jewish Democrats are alarmed by what they consider open antisemitism among far-left candidates encouraged by Mamdani’s success in the New York City mayoral race.</p> 
<p>AIPAC-backed Rep. Rob Menendez in New Jersey appears likely to draw a challenge from Mussab Ali, a former local school board president with a strong social media following. Ali, like Mamdani, began criticizing Israel within weeks of the Oct. 7 attacks — early compared to most people with hopes of running for office.</p> 
<p>Michigan’s open Democratic Senate primary offers another microcosm of the party’s evolving dynamics on the issue. The three-way brawl pits a sitting representative backed by the pro-Israel lobby against a former booster of the “uncommitted” movement to pressure a Gaza ceasefire and a progressive state lawmaker who’s shifted away from Israel.</p> 
<p>The Middle East crisis is also reshaping the contours of at least two House Democratic primaries in Illinois — home to large Jewish, Middle Eastern and Muslim communities. Statewide the tensions are apparent as well in the U.S. Senate contest to replace retiring Democrat Dick Durbin.</p> 
<p>And in New York City, home to the nation’s largest Jewish population, left-leaning challengers backed by the Democratic Socialists of America are eager to unseat Israel-supporting incumbent Reps. Dan Goldman, Grace Meng, Ritchie Torres and Adriano Espaillat.</p> 
<p>That includes a Mamdani-endorsed challenge to Goldman by former New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — a primary that promises to be a marquee intraparty fight over the issue.</p> 
<p>If successful, candidates willing to criticize Israel stand to remake a Democratic Party that has historically backed the Jewish state since its 1948 founding — a path some party officials acknowledge already may be too difficult to alter after the war isolated the country. The challenges by Israel critics, too, highlight growing Muslim populations and commensurate political strength in pockets around the country.</p> 
<p>Foreign affairs has divided Democrats before. Opposition to the war in Iraq helped Barack Obama stand out as a state senator in Illinois, while higher-profile pro-war Democrats — like Hillary Clinton — saw their electoral fortunes sink when support for the war became a disqualifying issue among Democrats.</p> 
<p>Israel — and increasing hostility from the left toward it — has conjured deep-seated emotions among Democrats watching the situation unfold with disbelief. Taken together, there’s a pervasive worry among Jewish political leaders that shifting political winds in the United States will have long-term consequences for Israel — and Jews — in the decades to come.</p> 
<p>“The whole democratic socialist movement has become very anti-Israel, which I don’t understand at all,” said David Weprin, a Queens state lawmaker. “I grew up with Israel being a very progressive country, a democratic country, one that tolerates everyone. It’s definitely something that I find disturbing.”</p> 
<p>Democrats’ divisions over Gaza are perhaps nowhere more pronounced than in Michigan, where disparate views of Israel continue to roil <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2025/11/19/michigan-democrats-push-to-label-war-on-gaza-a-genocide-as-party-moves-closer-to-their-position/" target="_blank"><u>state</u></a> politics and where Democrats are grappling with how to re-engage Arab American voters who shifted toward Trump last year.</p> 
<p>In Michigan’s marquee Democratic Senate primary, DMFI PAC endorsed Rep. Haley Stevens, who’s viewed as the establishment pick and who represents a substantial Jewish population. Stevens described herself as a “proud pro-Israel Democrat” in <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2025/11/dmfi-backs-haley-stevens-angie-craig-as-they-face-primaries-from-the-anti-israel-left/" target="_blank"><u>accepting DMFI’s support</u></a>. She also said she’d fight in the Senate to “support Israel’s security [and] ensure the ceasefire holds in Gaza.” AIPAC’s PAC, which has funneled millions toward Stevens in the past, has yet to issue an endorsement this cycle but features her prominently on its website.</p> 
<p>Her opponents have taken far more critical stances toward Israel.</p> 
<p>Abdul El-Sayed, a past gubernatorial hopeful who backed the “uncommitted” movement during the 2024 presidential primary but later endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, has described Gaza as a Rorschach test for Democrats’ values. He has repeatedly criticized Israel’s military actions and the <a href="https://x.com/AbdulElSayed/status/2007917034089467931?s=20" target="_blank"><u>U.S. dollars funding them</u></a> — and has used those stances to draw contrasts with rivals.</p> 
<p>El-Sayed was the first in the race to call the conflict in Gaza a genocide, a stance state Sen. Mallory McMorrow later adopted. McMorrow also joined El-Sayed in rejecting support from AIPAC. And both said they would have voted in favor of resolutions from Sen. Bernie Sanders blocking weapons sales to Israel — legislation Stevens said she would have voted against.</p> 
<p>McMorrow, whose husband is Jewish and whose daughter was the target of death threats after the Oct. 7 attacks, has shifted on Israel in a way that reflects the broader transformation occurring within the Democratic Party. She initially declined to call the war a genocide, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/mallory-mcmorrow-michigan-democratic-primary-gaza-genocide-00594679" target="_blank"><u>changed her stance in October</u></a> after a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds" target="_blank"><u>September United Nations report</u></a> claiming Israel had committed one.</p> 
<p>El-Sayed has indirectly criticized McMorrow for being a late adopter of his positions as the two progressives compete for the same slice of voters, including younger voters for whom Gaza remains an animating issue.</p> 
<p>The primary will also provide an early test of whether Michigan Democrats have been able to reengage Muslim voters, like <a href="https://dearborn.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/UNOFFICIAL%20Results_Nov%205%202024%20Presidential%20Election%20-%20ALL%20-%20ELECTION%20DAY_City%20of%20Dearborn.pdf" target="_blank"><u>those in Dearborn</u></a> who have historically backed Democrats but who split their tickets last year between Trump and Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin.</p> 
<p>“The politics around Israel-Palestine have changed dramatically over the last few years,” said a Democratic strategist who’s worked on Michigan races and was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the Senate primary's dynamics. “For 2026 and beyond, it’s less about candidates reacting and more about what they believe on the issue as a matter of core values. Just claiming to support a two-state solution isn’t going to cut it anymore.”</p> 
<p>Tensions over Israel are also simmering in a pair of Illinois House races and the U.S. Senate contest.</p> 
<p>The House seats are currently held by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who is retiring, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Durbin.</p> 
<p>State Sen. Laura Fine, one of the top candidates vying for Schakowsky’s seat, has been the beneficiary of a supportive AIPAC email — even though the organization has yet to endorse or donate to her campaign directly. Other high-profile candidates among the 17 in the Democratic primary include the left-leaning suburban Mayor Daniel Biss and social media influencer Kat Abughazaleh. Biss is Jewish, and Abughazaleh is Palestinian-American.</p> 
<p>The district spans Chicago and Evanston — home to Northwestern University — and includes suburban communities with significant Jewish, Muslim and Arab populations.</p> 
<p>In the district now held by Krishnamoorthi, candidates Junaid Ahmed and Yasmeen Bankole have both made Gaza a campaign priority and are running against former Rep. Melissa Bean, who hasn’t been endorsed by AIPAC but is viewed as a more moderate candidate.</p> 
<p>In New Jersey, Menendez is attempting to strike a balance in a district that has significant Arab and Jewish voters. While he supports Israel, he has also called for a two-state solution and has chastised colleagues for Islamophobia, including “vile rhetoric” directed at Mamdani.</p> 
<p>“My record of delivering for all of our residents and standing up to the Trump Administration speaks for itself. The same is true for my approach to the Middle East, from advocating for the release of the hostages, to surging humanitarian aid to Gaza, to working towards a lasting and durable peace for the region,” he said in a text message. “I look forward to having that conversation and will forcefully push back on any attempt to misrepresent my record.”</p> 
<p>As support for Israel has weakened, Menendez’s likely challenger Ali believes pro-Israel politics can be disqualifying for incumbent Democrats.</p> 
<p>“Eventually, politicians who think that they can hide behind talking points will be outed,” Ali said. “You’re seeing that right now with a bunch of people challenging AIPAC’s influence.”</p> 
<p>Mamdani’s meteoric rise has fueled far-left challenges to incumbent Democrats across the Big Apple. Several Democrats have expressed interest in running against pro-Israel Democrat Dan Goldman. In the Bronx, former Democratic Committee Vice Chair Michael Blake has predicated his campaign on running against Torres’ stridently pro-Israel views.</p> 
<p>The dynamic facing the party is a reversal from the 2024 cycle, when moderate Democrats backed by millions of dollars in support from AIPAC ran to oust anti-Israel lawmakers. The Democratic Majority for Israel PAC spent more than $11 million on races across the country during the 2024 election as well, with 80 percent of its endorsed candidates winning their races. </p> 
<p>In New York City's suburbs, Rep. George Latimer successfully defeated incumbent Democrat Jamaal Bowman after a bitterly fought race featuring plenty of rhetoric about Israel.</p> 
<p>Latimer, who was among the incumbents recently endorsed by DMFI, said in an interview he expects another left-flank primary challenge next year, driven in part by opposition to Israel. Prominent Jewish leaders in New York, though, are skeptical the posture makes much sense when most voters are focused on pocketbook concerns — an issue effectively leveraged by Mamdani.</p> 
<p>“Everybody in America wants to be Zohran Mamdani, but there’s only one Zohran Mamdani,” said David Greenfield, a former city councilmember and head of The Met Council, a Jewish charity. “The reason he won is not because of Israel, he won because of affordability.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans want a big Supreme Court redistricting win. They’re losing hope it will help them in the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Louisiana v. Callais</i> could <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/08/08/its-been-60-years-since-the-voting-rights-act-was-signed-will-it-make-it-to-61-00500390" target="_blank">weaken the Voting Rights Act</a> and open the door to redrawing congressional maps, particularly across the South. Court watchers <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-argument-00609187" target="_blank">expect at least a partial win for conservatives</a> that could let the GOP draw more seats for themselves by erasing Black- and Hispanic-majority districts.</p> 
<p>But while that decision could theoretically come as soon as when the court returns on Friday, many experts think the case is more likely to be resolved with the flurry of decisions the court typically releases in late June.</p> 
<p>The window of opportunity for new maps going into place before this November’s elections is rapidly closing, as states would need ample time to change deadlines, shift election calendars, vet signatures and print and distribute ballots. And the longer it takes for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling, the harder it will be for state-level Republicans to throw their maps out and draw new ones before this fall’s elections.</p> 
<p>“It can get very complicated and very sticky, and that is not fast work,” said Tammy Patrick, the chief programs officer for The Election Center, a nonpartisan consulting firm that works with state and local election officials. “That is time-consuming, very methodical and detail-oriented work that needs to have sufficient time.”</p> 
<p>Some state-level Republicans have already given up hope. In Louisiana, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case, some state officials believe it's already too late and that the state will have to <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2026/01/02/louisiana-will-use-challenged-congressional-map-after-supreme-court-declines-to-expedite-ruling/" target="_blank">use its current map in its 2026 elections</a> regardless of the Court’s decision, as the candidate qualifying period opens next month. Louisiana Republicans <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/29/louisiana-election-dates/" target="_blank">pushed back its 2026 primary election dates</a> from April to May during a special session late last year, in hopes the Court would rule by the end of 2025 and give them time to install a new map. But the shift still wouldn’t be late enough for a late-term SCOTUS ruling.</p> 
<p>Some national Republicans, however, say there's plenty of time to take on a redraw before November, arguing the Legislature can move the deadlines in order to redraw before elections are underway. </p> 
<p>At the center of the Supreme Court case is Section 2 of the VRA, a provision that broadly outlaws discrimination in elections on the basis of race and has led to the creation of majority-minority districts, where Black, Latino or Asian voters make up a majority of the population.</p> 
<p>Republicans have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/27/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-00042478" target="_blank">long argued such districts violate the Constitution</a> and benefit Democrats. Democrats warn that the elimination of seats drawn to satisfy Section 2 could decimate minority representation in Congress and allow lawmakers to redraw lines in such a way to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/republicans-scotus-vra-00597212" target="_blank">eliminate as many as 19 Democrat-held</a>, majority-minority districts, many in the South.</p> 
<p>Democrats in Blue states could also take advantage of a Section 2 change and redraw, but the party’s options are more limited, both because of geographic limitations and pressure from civil rights and minority groups.</p> 
<p>But even as many legal experts expect the court to rule in a way that weakens the VRA, the case’s prominence has led many watchers to predict an end of term ruling in June. At that point, many states across the country will have already held primary contests and there will be no room to undertake redistricting.</p> 
<p>“If it's in any way a big deal, we're not going to get that decision before June,” said Justin Levitt, a professor of law at Loyola Law School who worked in the Biden White House as an adviser on democracy and voting rights. “It's really hard for me to see a decision that does anything significant that wouldn't occasion a major dissent, and it's really hard for me to see that dissent not taking a fairly long time in the back-and-forth.”</p> 
<p>Many southern states where Republicans stand the most to gain have early primaries — seven of the 11 states that belonged to the Confederacy have primaries scheduled before or on May 19 — making the timing even tougher for the GOP.</p> 
<p>That doesn’t mean that lawmakers are done gerrymandering before the 2026 election.</p> 
<p>At least three southern states — Florida, Kentucky and Virginia — are eyeing redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms, and lawmakers seem emboldened to attempt it with or without a Supreme Court ruling. In Florida, state House Republicans hope to tackle the issue during the legislative session that started this month, while Gov. Ron DeSantis called a special session in late April, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/desantis-florida-redistricting-special-session-00713882?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">in an effort to wait as “long as feasible”</a> for a Supreme Court decision. And in Kentucky, some Republican lawmakers <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2025/08/25/state-lawmakers-weigh-redistricting-following-governor-s-comments" target="_blank">are weighing a redraw</a>, even though the map would likely be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.</p> 
<p>In Virginia, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/spanberger-redistricting-00683066" target="_blank">the Democratic-controlled legislature is considering a move</a> independent of a Supreme Court decision that will put redistricting before voters akin to the move in California last year. </p> 
<p>But other southern states reliant on a weakened VRA to redraw, like South Carolina and Alabama, may be out of luck. Republicans in the Palmetto State — including Rep. Ralph Norman, who is running for governor — are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/28/republican-states-voting-rights-act-redistricting-00623775" target="_blank">pushing the legislature to draw out</a> the state’s lone Democrat, Rep. Jim Clyburn. But the state’s candidate filing deadline looms in late March.</p> 
<p>Pushing back the filing deadline further in hopes for a Supreme Court decision would scramble the primary calendar and put elections officials in a bind.</p> 
<p>“Anytime a state decides to redistrict, it creates a domino effect of administrative issues that need to be addressed,” said David Becker, the executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research. “Election officials and voters are able to manage that when it's once every 10 years. When it becomes once every two years, it might get very, very difficult for that to be managed.”</p> 
<p>Utah got a taste of the challenge of shuffling deadlines late last year after a district judge <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/utah-judge-denies-gop-passed-congressional-map-00646183" target="_blank">installed a new congressional map in November</a>. The state’s top election official, Republican Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, immediately announced her office would move forward with the new map, even as Republican lawmakers fumed and vowed to fight it. “There will likely be an emergency appeal,” <a href="https://x.com/LGHendersonUtah/status/1988267731695894686?s=20" target="_blank">she noted on X</a>, “but the process of finalizing new boundary details will take weeks of meticulous work on the part of state and county officials.”</p> 
<p>The state’s Republican-controlled legislature went forward with an appeal — which is unrelated to the VRA — after it <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/12/28/utahs-redistricting-long-game-00706994" target="_blank">pushed back the candidate filing deadline</a> by two months for congressional hopefuls during a special session last month, offering itself a window for potential judicial action. Should the legislature — which meets for its scheduled session this month — again adjust the electoral calendar, it would send elections officials statewide into a scramble.</p> 
<p>“The questions we would be asking are, you know, how much time do we have to program our ballot? What are the new dates? What would we communicate with voters?” said Nikila Venugopal, the Salt Lake County chief deputy clerk. “We haven't heard any plans to do so at this point, and we're moving forward with the assumption that the elections will be held as planned.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Democrats’ biggest outside allies have set a new fundraising record for the organizations that will help boost the party ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>House Majority PAC, House Democrats’ main super PAC, and its associated nonprofit raised a combined $121 million in 2025, more than they have in any previous non-election year dating back to HMP's 2011 founding.</p> 
<p>The pair of groups raised a combined $81 million in the final six months of 2025, doubling its haul during the first six months of the year — a sign of donors’ growing optimism for the party tied to its overperformance in a slate of off-year elections. The numbers were first shared with POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“As Democrats continue to expand the map and build momentum for the 2026 midterms, we could not be more excited to announce our record-breaking fundraising in 2025,” said House Majority PAC President Mike Smith. “We look forward to taking back the House in 2026.”</p> 
<p>For comparison, House Majority PAC raised $72 million for the entire 2018 election cycle. The group didn’t launch its affiliated nonprofit until 2019. In 2023, the groups raised a combined $76 million.</p> 
<p>House Majority PAC, closely aligned with House Democratic leadership, is often the biggest outside spender on the left in House races. Raising cash can help fuel candidates across the congressional map, but it's not the only decisive factor in a cycle reshaped by aggressive redistricting across the country. Nonetheless, Democrats are increasingly bullish about their chances, pointing to their recent double-digit victories in last fall's off-year elections. </p> 
<p>It's also not clear if Democrats will hold a cash advantage in outside spending. Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC affiliated with Republican House leadership, has not yet released its fundraising totals. CLF and its affiliated nonprofit, American Action Network, <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/campaigns/gop-group-60m/" target="_blank">outraised its Democratic counterparts over the first six months of 2025</a>, $60 million to $40 million.</p> 
<p>House Majority PAC did not release its cash on hand totals, so it’s not clear how much they have in the bank to spend on campaigns in 2026. The super PAC will file its next disclosure on Jan. 31, but its nonprofit will not file until late 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Conway wants to impeach President Donald Trump. He may soon get a vote to do so.</p> 
<p>The attorney, pundit and staunch anti-Trump critic formally launched his bid for a Manhattan House seat today and is framing his run around an all-encompassing effort to oppose the president.</p> 
<p>The rollout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5pQ91oG7lk" target="_blank">includes a 2-minute video</a> that features images of Jan. 6, a woman being led away by immigration enforcement officers and photos of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein and Vladimir Putin. In the video, Conway calls Trump “mendacious,” “corrupt” and “criminal.”</p> 
<p>He pledges to “not be an ordinary member of Congress” given the extraordinary political moment.</p> 
<p>In an interview with POLITICO, he went even further, saying that Trump’s actions in Venezuela — including the seizure of President Nicolás Maduro to face criminal charges in the U.S. — are among the impeachable crimes he’s committed.</p> 
<p>“He completely disregarded the War Powers Act,” Conway said. “He’s abusing his power as commander-in-chief. Don’t get me wrong, Maduro is a bad guy and he’s probably guilty of all the crimes he’s been charged with in the Southern District of New York. But President Trump is doing this without consultation to Congress.”</p> 
<p>The White House did not return a message seeking comment.</p> 
<p>Conway is a first-time candidate who only recently registered as a Democrat ahead of filing to run in the deep blue district being vacated by Rep. Jerrold Nadler. A former Republican, Conway left the GOP in protest during Trump’s first term.</p> 
<p>He'll face a large field of Democratic contenders, including state Assemblymember Alex Borres, New York City Council Member Erik Bottcher, former Nadler aide and state Assemblymember Micah Lasher and Kennedy scion Jack Schlossberg.</p> 
<p>The seat is unlikely to be competitive in the November election, making the winner of the Democratic primary Nadler’s likely successor</p> 
<p>Conway’s positioned himself as a forceful Trump antagonist — the kind of aggressive posture that’s popular with Democrats eager for a sharp-edged approach to take on the president. Conway and his wife Kellyanne, a former Trump adviser, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/kellyanne-george-conway-announce-divorce-rcna73451" target="_blank">announced in 2023 they would divorce</a>.</p> 
<p>His House campaign will test the limits of how much Democratic voters want to express their disdain for the president. Many candidates this year are placing a focus on affordability — a buzzy political issue that Trump and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani rode to success in their campaigns.</p> 
<p>Yet Conway believes voters’ concerns all flow from one source: Trump.</p> 
<p>“The politics of this aren’t divided in my view between talking about Trump and holding Trump accountable and then all the kitchen table issues,” he said. “They’re not separate.”</p> 
<p>Conway will still have to persuade Democratic primary voters, though. His recent conversion to the Democratic Party will likely come under scrutiny. But he insisted his ties to the district are strong — adding that his kids were born in the city and that he now lives there.</p> 
<p>“I made my life here,” he said. “This district has been the center of my life since I got out of law school.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats hoping to win higher office this year are seizing on President Donald Trump’s intervention in Venezuela to push a twist on one of his campaign promises: America first.</p> 
<p>Across the country, candidates and lawmakers are slamming Trump’s decision to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and are using the moment to hammer their domestic affordability message.</p> 
<p>“Ohioans are facing higher costs across the board and are desperate for leadership that will help deliver relief,” former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is running to reclaim his seat, <a href="https://x.com/SherrodBrown/status/2007540609284755882?s=20" target="_blank">said on X</a>. “We should be more focused on improving the lives of Ohioans – not Caracas.”</p> 
<p>The frame from Democrats shows how potent the party views <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/12/31/the-year-of-affordability-begins-00708410" target="_blank">affordability as an issue</a> in the midterms, one that Trump and his team have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/donald-trump-affordability-2025-elections-james-blair-00637711" target="_blank">grown increasingly preoccupied by</a> after across-the-board losses in 2025.</p> 
<p>“The problem Trump was already having was that he looked like he was focused on everything other than what matters in people's daily life,” said longtime Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, a former spokesperson for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “And now he’s just supercharged that.”</p> 
<p>Trump won in 2024 largely by running on affordability, and his less interventionist “America First” approach helped him win over more isolationist voters who had been alienated by the neoconservative approach of the Republican Party in the Iraq War era. But continuing economic uncertainty and persistent inflation, combined with his second-term shift towards a more aggressive foreign policy approach, threaten to hurt the president and his party at the ballot box.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/poll-affordability-cost-of-living-00678076" target="_blank">Polling shows</a> that cost of living will remain top of voters’ minds before November, something that Ferguson said “transcends every subgroup.”</p> 
<p>In some of the party’s most competitive 2026 midterm primaries, Democrats are coalescing around messaging on Venezuela.</p> 
<p>In Michigan, where the war in Gaza drew clear fissures between Democratic opponents, all three candidates sang the same domestically-focused tune.</p> 
<p>“Americans have made themselves crystal clear: they don’t want to risk sliding into another costly war abroad. Families are struggling to buy groceries. People are skipping doctor's visits because they can't pay for healthcare,” state Sen. Mallory McMorrow <a href="https://x.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/2007499092902183088" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>.</p> 
<p>“Make no mistake, this is about enriching his oil executive donors who want access to Venezuela’s oil — not about democracy or Maduro or narcotics. Meanwhile, they tell us we can’t afford healthcare at home,” <a href="https://x.com/AbdulElSayed/status/2007442003210944642" target="_blank">Abdul El Sayed, the former head of the Wayne County Department of Health, wrote on X</a>.</p> 
<p>“Taking over another country while Americans can't afford their rent and groceries is unacceptable,” <a href="https://x.com/RepHaleyStevens/status/2007536459004424533" target="_blank">said Rep. Haley Stevens</a> (D-Mich.).</p> 
<p>The issue isn’t just being used by midterm hopefuls. Potential <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-venezuela-democrats-2028-president-00709912" target="_blank">Democratic 2028 candidates</a> are bringing affordability to the forefront of their Venezuela messaging.</p> 
<p>“As of this week, millions of Americans are now paying thousands more for health insurance,” former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://x.com/petebuttigieg/status/2008182341706056142?s=46" target="_blank">said Monday</a>. “If the President and Congressional GOP think Washington has the capacity to ‘run’ Venezuela right now, why won't they fix the insurance cost crisis they've created here at home?”</p> 
<p>Longtime Miami-based Democratic strategist Christian Ulvert thinks his party is right to remind voters of what they see as failures in Trump’s domestic agenda as he sets his sights abroad, including on cost of living issues — as long as that messaging doesn’t overshadow a cogent perspective on how they would approach relations with Venezuela. South Florida is home to one of the biggest Venezuelan communities in the country, which has been shaken by Trump’s recent revocation of Temporary Protected Status for those fleeing Maduro’s regime.</p> 
<p>“Democrats need to also appreciate that many things can be true. It's not a single issue, especially in this moment, and we have to talk about it in a way where you can join Venezuelans in speaking up that Maduro being gone is a victory for Venezuelans,” Ulvert said.</p> 
<p>Some Democrats who served in foreign wars have also chosen to center a critique of American interventionism in addition to joining in on the party’s pivot back to cost of living.</p> 
<p>Graham Platner, a veteran of the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan who is now running to unseat Sen. Susan Collins in Maine, has seized on Trump’s vague suggestions that the U.S. will run Venezuela following Maduro’s forced ouster.</p> 
<p>“Bullshit. This has never worked,” Platner posted <a href="https://x.com/grahamformaine/status/2007499091157385709" target="_blank">in response to a clip of the president’s Saturday morning remarks</a>. “I watched my friends die in Iraq in the wake of speeches like this one.”</p> 
<p>Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego — an Iraq War veteran — has been outspoken on the American military action in Venezuela, flooding social media and cable news with broadsides aimed at Trump. He <a href="https://x.com/RubenGallego/status/2007379621155930357" target="_blank">expressed a similar frustration</a>: “I fought in some of the hardest battles of the Iraq War. Saw my brothers die, saw civilians being caught in the crossfire all for an unjustified war. No matter the outcome we are in the wrong for starting this war in Venezuela.”</p> 
<p>Republicans, however, are backing Trump and praising the action he took against Maduro.</p> 
<p>“Nicolas Maduro is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans after years of trafficking illegal drugs and violent cartel members into our country — crimes for which he’s been properly indicted in U.S. courts and an arrest warrant duly issued — and today he learned what accountability looks like,” House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/2007468765718384961?s=20" target="_blank">said on X</a> the day the operation became public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dropped out of the Minnesota governor’s race on Monday, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is considering jumping in to replace him.</p> 
<p>Walz’s decision to not seek a historic third term upends the race and shocked the Minnesota political world. The two-term governor, who served as the Democrats’ 2024 vice presidential nominee, was facing a potentially tough reelection fight as Republicans sought to tie him to a federal probe into a massive welfare fraud scandal in the state.</p> 
<p>Walz acknowledged that the scandal played a role in his choice.</p> 
<p>“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he said in a Monday statement.</p> 
<p>Dozens of people have been charged with felonies for stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Covid-era government programs intended to help feed children. Republicans were eager to tie Walz to the scheme, though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.</p> 
<p>It’s a remarkable turn of events for the governor, who was elevated to national status by Kamala Harris in her 2024 sprint of a campaign and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/08/tim-walz-2024-campaign-critiques-00219718" target="_blank"><u>who until recently had left the door open to a 2028 presidential run of his own.&nbsp;</u></a></p> 
<p>“Many Democrats don't want him to run, including me,” said one senior Minnesota Democratic lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “He is certainly not corrupt, but he has not handled the fraud problem well and we worry about his electability.”</p> 
<p>Walz met with Klobuchar on Sunday to discuss the campaign, according to two people familiar with the meeting. A person close to Klobuchar, granted anonymity to describe the senator’s private thinking, said the Minnesota senator is receiving encouragement to run and she's seriously considering it but has not decided on her plans. That development might be a boon to Democrats in the competitive state, as she has run well ahead of others in her party — including Walz — in past statewide campaigns.</p> 
<p>Republicans face a crowded primary for governor, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, state Rep. Kristin Robbins and Minneapolis attorney Chris Madel.</p> 
<p>The Republican Governors’ Association crowed over Walz’s exit, adding in a statement on Monday: “After presiding over one of the biggest fraud scandals in history it’s no wonder that Tim Walz is being forced to drop his re-election bid. Walz’s failed leadership is emblematic of Minnesota Democrats’ agenda and whoever Democrats choose to replace Walz with at the top of the ticket will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY, New York — Gov. Kathy Hochul is trying to center her reelection campaign on the cost of living. Doing so is putting her at odds with both the populist left and a resurgent Republican right.</p> 
<p>She faces left-flank pressure <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/hochul-edges-toward-tax-hikes-after-mamdani-win-00675597" target="_blank"><u>to raise taxes on rich people</u></a> so that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s expensive agenda comes to fruition. On the right, Republicans have pledged to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/republicans-try-to-remake-national-democratic-candidates-into-mamdani-copycats-00636887?experience_id=EXYF89KVT5UQ&amp;is_magic_link=true&amp;template_id=OTJIR2CRKUD6&amp;template_variant_id=OTV632IE7RALS" target="_blank"><u>exploit any effort</u></a> to support Mamdani’s goals as a sign the moderate Democrat is beholden to the upstart democratic socialist.</p> 
<p><a href="https://sri.siena.edu/2025/12/16/hochul-holds-19-point-lead-over-stefanik-leads-blakeman-by-25-points/?_gl=1*1jn78nv*_ga*MjAyMDI4ODQzNC4xNzQ0MDYzODQ1*_ga_XN3VDZ9ZYZ*czE3NjczNzI2NTIkbzk2JGcwJHQxNzY3MzcyNjUyJGo2MCRsMCRoMA.." target="_blank"><u>Hochul holds wide leads</u></a> over likely Republican nominee Bruce Blakeman and primary challenger Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, but the strength of her campaign will be vital for down-ballot Democratic candidates running in crucial House races. New York’s swing Congressional districts have the potential to determine control of the closely divided chamber and the future of Trump’s presidency.</p> 
<p>Yet she must still work with both the untested mayor who vowed at his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/01/mamdani-vows-to-purse-bold-agenda-as-he-takes-the-helm-of-new-york-city-00708878" target="_blank"><u>inauguration to govern unapologetically</u></a> from the left and the volatile Republican president eager to shape the fate of Democratic-led states. Veteran politicians aren’t envious of the challenge she faces.</p> 
<p>“I’m glad it’s Gov. Hochul and not me,” former Gov. David Paterson said. “You’re dealing with two very excitable people who are on opposite ends of the spectrum. My only suggestion to her is let them yell and criticize, but be the voice of reason. It’s putting yourself out there to your fellow New Yorkers.”</p> 
<p>Yet the governor is showing signs that she’s willing to blend the policies of both the mercurial president and rookie mayor — making cost concerns a centerpiece for the coming year amid the expectation voters will reward her for sympathizing with their pocketbook problems.</p> 
<p>Hochul plans to make a major push for free child care, a signature Mamdani proposal and an issue she’s supported during her time in office, with a multi-year plan to phase in a statewide program, she said in a recent radio interview — essentially backing a downpayment with the promise of future installments if she wins reelection. The governor also embraced a Trump-backed proposal to cap taxes on tips at the state level amid Republican pressure to do so, signaling plans to introduce legislation this year to the Democratic-dominated Legislature, which is set to reconvene Wednesday in Albany.</p> 
<p>“As we welcome in the New Year, affordability remains my top priority and I am doubling down on my commitment to put money back in New Yorkers’ pockets,” Hochul said last week.</p> 
<p>The governor, though, is facing opponents who will try to lay claim to the affordability mantle that Mamdani leveraged so effectively in his longshot bid for mayor. That will put pressure on Hochul to deliver on these populist themes — or potentially face the electoral consequences.</p> 
<p>“Politicians are the original copycats,” said Democratic strategist Austin Shafran. “Zohran masterfully articulated an affordability agenda and was able to articulate concerns to a broader electorate. You’re going to see a lot of people try to thematically copy the message of his campaign and that may counteract a lot of the uncertainty.”</p> 
<p>Hochul’s reelection will hinge on whether she can adroitly navigate a destabilizing populist tide that has consumed this political era — defined by voters fed up with rising costs and elections won by norm-shattering politicians like Trump and Mamdani. Hochul is drawing energetic challenges from Delgado, her own hand-picked lieutenant governor who is trying to channel Mamdani’s victory in his uphill bid, and Blakeman, a Trump-backed Republican who hails from a suburban bellwether county.</p> 
<p>Impatient voters are increasingly willing to punish any candidate who fails to grasp their cost-of-living concerns. How Hochul adapts to this political moment will determine her electoral fate — and potentially provide a roadmap for fellow moderates struggling to make the center hold.</p> 
<p>Mollifying voters’ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/poll-affordability-cost-of-living-00678076" target="_blank"><u>affordability concerns</u></a> is not an easy task and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nrid=5a6c3b75-5f75-4344-a790-271a3d22772b" target="_blank"><u>Trump’s low marks</u></a> over his handling of the economy is a case in point. The president’s insistence that inflation is tamed, prices are down and the economy under his watch is on the rebound runs the risk of replicating voters’ complaints that Democrats were oblivious to how they felt about their financial plight.</p> 
<p>Further complicating Hochul’s year is the unusual bind she finds herself in — essentially sandwiched between the two main characters of America’s political drama.</p> 
<p>Mamdani’s free child care and bus service must be approved by Albany and will be difficult to deliver to voters in a deeply expensive city. Increasing taxes on wealthy New Yorkers and large corporations, while politically popular and drew enthusiastic cheers during Mamdani’s inaugural speech, opens Hochul up to Republican attacks as she runs for reelection. Trump may further meddle in his native state’s affairs by slashing federal spending to the Empire State. His administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/23/trumps-war-on-offshore-wind-threatens-hochuls-energy-strategy-00703463" target="_blank"><u>shelved two offshore wind projects</u></a>, including one near the Long Island coast, and Trump recently <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/video/on-air/as-seen-on/ny-gov-kathy-hochul-talks-congestion-pricing-reelection-and-more-in-1-on-1-interview/6434842/" target="_blank"><u>expressed frustration to Hochul</u></a> with a controversial Manhattan toll known as congestion pricing.</p> 
<p>Voters are willing to turn to Hochul-like moderates amid the Trump 2.0 era. In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger decisively beat Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. Mikie Sherrill retained the New Jersey governor’s office for Democrats by a double-digit margin — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/06/mikie-sherill-interview-margin-of-victory-00639473" target="_blank">bucking an historical trend</a> in the process.</p> 
<p>Hochul, who often references her family’s economic challenges growing up in the Buffalo area, was sensitive to affordability concerns before it was a buzzy political concern.</p> 
<p>As a new governor, Hochul backed a temporary suspension of the state’s tax on gasoline. She’s touted rebate checks to taxpayers, framed as a way of combating inflation. Hochul scaled back green energy plans amid widespread concerns over spiking utility bills — drawing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/democrats-focus-on-affordability-over-climate-goals-as-midterm-elections-loom-00649370" target="_blank"><u>complaints from environmental activists</u></a>. And she reduced a controversial Manhattan toll from $15 to $9 after delaying its implementation for six months ahead of the 2024 elections out of political concerns.</p> 
<p>But the political environment is giving her less leeway to pick and choose her policy fights.</p> 
<p>This year, the staid governor is contending with a celebrity New York City mayor whose ardent left-leaning base will pressure her to back policies she’s been hesitant to embrace, like raising taxes. Hochul has repeatedly ruled out boosting income tax rates on the richest New Yorkers, but has hedged over hiking levies on large corporations.</p> 
<p>Republicans pressed Hochul to back Trump’s push to cap taxes on tips by instituting a similar policy on the state level. After the governor announced her support to end taxes on up to $25,000 in tipped income, Blakeman’s campaign accused her of flip flopping on the issue — though her campaign said she never outright opposed the measure.</p> 
<p>“Kathy, if you want more of my ‘tips’ on how to govern, just continue to follow my lead,” Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Left-leaning advocates, meanwhile, are mounting a renewed push for another state-level minimum wage increase — a move that is opposed by the governor’s allies in the business community. Hochul approved a 2023 measure that will link future wage hikes to the rate of inflation.</p> 
<p>Hochul’s political bet, in part, is on voters preferring a steady hand on the wheel in an age of political disruption that has benefited both Trump and Mamdani. At the same time, she has strived to counter the president, including a successful effort that got him to restore $187 million in Homeland Security funding.</p> 
<p>“She doesn’t have to be the disruptive leader that follows this trend because that might seem inauthentic,” said Basil Smikle, a former executive director of the state Democratic Committee. “What she does need to do is find a way to create a strong relationship with Mamdani. He can be the disruptive politician and be a counterweight to that, but still give a pathway to bring a lot of policies to the forefront.”</p> 
<p>The new mayor has forged a publicly steady relationship with the governor despite their differences on key issues like Israel. Hochul has also approved of Mamdani’s hires, most notably the retention of Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch — a favorite of the city’s business community.</p> 
<p>Mamdani remains a lightning rod, though, especially among Jewish voters and suburbanites — constituencies the governor will need as she begins to campaign in earnest. The new mayor kicked off a firestorm on his first day in office when he revoked several executive orders meant to bolster Israel and deleted old tweets from his office’s X account about fighting antisemitism. <b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p>Blakeman, Hochul’s likely November opponent, is already blasting her for aligning herself with the 34-year-old democratic socialist. Hochul’s political standing is tied in large part to the incoming mayor’s success.</p> 
<p>“It depends on how Mamdani does,” said longtime Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. “If Mamdani fails in the first six months, then she’ll take a beating.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK — Zohran Mamdani rode the digital slipstream to success in New York. Now millennials and Gen Zers are banking on a similar wave to boost their political dreams.</p> 
<p>The mayor-elect energized New York City’s youth vote, earning the support of nearly 70 percent of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2025-elections/new-york-city-mayor-results" target="_blank"><u>voters aged 18 to 44</u></a> in the general election. His publicity strategy — complete with shareable graphics, collaborations with content creators and local artists’ animations — appealed to a new trove of young voters, people who primarily get their information in short-form TikTok videos and social media posts rather than legacy media.</p> 
<p>A wave of millennial and Gen Z Democratic hopefuls across the country are looking to follow that lead in shaking up an aging party <b>— </b>from a 25-year-old political influencer in Arizona, to a 35-year-old congressional candidate in Idaho, to a 24-year-old mayoral candidate in Georgia.</p> 
<p>“The theme that we have seen this year, different from years past, is ‘I'm done waiting around. I'm sick of being told it's not my turn,’” said Amanda Litman, president of Run for Something, a candidate recruitment company focused on electing progressives under 40.</p> 
<p>The surge has rippled far beyond New York, touching races in red and purple states alike as younger Democrats test whether digital-first campaigns can compensate for limited funding, party support and name recognition.</p> 
<p>It also has reopened a debate inside the Democratic Party over what it takes to build a viable campaign — and whether traditional gatekeepers are misreading how younger voters engage with politics. While Gen Z and millennials span different age groups, both are entering politics with similar digital fluency — and similar distance from the party’s traditional power structures.</p> 
<p>The effects are already visible in candidate recruitment. Run for Something reported a surge of 10,000 young Democrats across the country expressing interest in launching a campaign immediately after Mamdani’s primary win. Another 1,616 potential candidates signed up within one day of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/senate-passes-shutdown-ending-deal-00646020" target="_blank"><u>shutdown-ending deal</u></a> to reopen the government, the group said.</p> 
<p>“We’re building a party of fighters, not folders,” Litman <a href="https://x.com/amandalitman/status/1987915132630921271" target="_blank"><u>posted on X</u></a> in November along with a graph of the sign-up splurge.</p> 
<p>The push for younger candidates comes as Democratic leadership skews older than the electorate it represents. The <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/16/age-and-generation-in-the-119th-congress-somewhat-younger-with-fewer-boomers-and-more-gen-xers/" target="_blank"><u>average age in the House and the Senate</u></a> is roughly 58 and 65, respectively, and the median school board member is 59, according to Pew Research Center. The median age in the United States is 39.</p> 
<p>More than 20 progressives under the age of 40 have announced a congressional campaign for this election cycle, nearly half of whom are looking to unseat a member of their own party. And with the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/07/poll-leader-democrats-00633577" target="_blank"><u>Democratic Party having no clear leader,</u></a> the younger generation is looking to add new faces into the mix.</p> 
<p>For inexperienced candidates who don’t have the money or institutional support to run a competitive campaign, social media offers a cost-free solution. The ease of building an online following has lowered the perceived barrier to running for office, even as the fundamentals of winning — fundraising, turnout and organization — remain unchanged.</p> 
<p>Take Sam Foster, a 24-year-old from Marietta, Georgia. He rode his bike to the first video shoot for his mayoral campaign against incumbent Steve Tumlin, who is 78. Social media, he said, isn’t as much a strategy for Gen Z and millennial candidates as it is a native mode of communication.</p> 
<p>“I hate when people call it a social media campaign,” Foster said. “I went into [making content] with the intention of just showing people who I was. We built a strategy off of that, but it wasn’t essentially the intention.”</p> 
<p>Mamdani, a democratic socialist who polled at under 1 percent in February, soft-launched his campaign in July with videos asking New Yorkers why they voted for Trump. His later videos on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyL4PsmA3u8" target="_blank"><u>halalflation</u></a>,” a fully suited polar plunge to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZohranKMamdani/videos/im-freezing-your-rent-as-the-next-mayor-of-new-york-citylets-plunge-into-the-det/1172637561248053/" target="_blank"><u>“freeze” the rent</u></a> and a Valentine’s Day voter registration proposal kept him prevalent on social feeds.</p> 
<p>And the more he posted, the more users — even those well outside of New York City — responded.</p> 
<p>“If done well, [social media] allows you to raise lots of small dollars from lots of different places,” said Chris Coffey, a longtime political consultant and CEO of Tusk Strategies.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/54/bd/a39340264e6bbe8a3ea4922734dc/gettyimages-2246211984.jpg" alt="Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani takes a selfie with a former Marine on Veterans Day.

"/><p>One Mamdani video asked supporters to donate to his transition team. The comment section was flooded with promises of donations from people as far away as Europe — with in-country support from Texas, California and Florida as well. From July to the election in November, Mamdani raised over $750,000 from over 8,500 contributors outside of New York City, <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/FTMSearch/Candidates/Contributions?ec=2025&amp;rt=can&amp;cand=2899&amp;boro=Z%2CZZ&amp;stmt=12%2C13%2C14%2C15" target="_blank"><u>according to data from the Campaign Finance Board.&nbsp;</u></a></p> 
<p>Coffey drew a comparison to Andrew Yang, who also had a strong social media presence and made history by raising $750,000 in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/01/andrew-yang-fundraising-campaign-074654" target="_blank"><u>just one day</u></a> for his 2020 presidential campaign, with an average donation of $41.</p> 
<p>“Both Yang and Mamdani were able to use their social media and digital media platforms to get lots and lots and lots of small donors, which then powered their campaign, de-emphasized big dollars and allowed them to play on a level playing field with all these other candidates that were going after bigger dollars,” said Coffey, who helped manage Yang’s 2021 bid for New York City mayor.</p> 
<p>Mamdani's messaging inspired more than <a href="https://www.transition2025.com/" target="_blank"><u>100,000 volunteers</u></a> to be visible daily on New York streets throughout the mayoral race.</p> 
<p>His messaging also maintained an appearance of authenticity, focusing on issues that disproportionately affect young and working class New Yorkers, like housing, childcare, and affordability.</p> 
<p>For young voters, authenticity is a major problem in the Democratic Party. And younger candidates are proving adept at conveying a message “from the heart,” according to Deja Foxx, a grassroots organizer and digital strategist who previously ran for Arizona’s 7th Congressional District.</p> 
<p>“People have a different expectation of how they should be engaging with public figures [than they did 10 years ago],” Foxx said. “We are consuming so much on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where videos from our Congress person are mixed in with life updates from our best friend from middle school. It demands a different level of vulnerability that frankly a lot of our older electives aren’t comfortable with.”</p> 
<p>The embrace of online-first campaigning has also blurred the line between political organizing and performance. Jack Schlossberg, the 32-year-old grandson of John F. Kennedy who’s running for Rep. Jerry Nadler’s congressional seat, is a provocative social media personality, sometimes offering raunchy and offensive political commentary to his 860,000 followers.</p> 
<p>Schlossberg shares random, quotidian tidbits, like being called an “incel Frankenstein looking mother—” by a random passerby. He impersonated Melania Trump — wig and all — as he read a letter of support to Vladimir Putin, trolled his uncle Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's health policies — insinuating his uncle’s claims of autism being linked to circumcision came from personal experience — and gave crass explanations of political news like the release of the Epstein files, New York Attorney General Letitia James’ indictment (since tossed) and the government shutdown.</p> 
<p>While his videos drive an audience, and have certainly got voters talking, they lack what other candidates are hinging on — promises and policies.</p> 
<p>For those who aren’t Kennedys — like Kaylee Peterson, a 35-year-old Idaho candidate in the historically Republican 1st District — social media is their pathway into the otherwise pay-to-play world of campaigning.</p> 
<p>“Social media is the only real affordable tool we have to reach disenfranchised Gen Z and millennial voters,” said Peterson. “Seeing [Mamdani] be successful and the massive national support he received gave us hope.”</p> 
<p>Like many other progressive candidates in rural republican areas, Peterson said, she did not receive support — or even a call back — from the Democratic National Committee. Instead, she found her support, strategists and community on social media groups where other young candidates virtually congregated — like TikTok Live, Instagram and messaging apps.</p> 
<p>Peterson ran a losing campaign against Republican incumbent Rep. Russell Mark Fulcher in 2022 with only $70,000. She focused on getting her message out and mobilizing progressives in her district. In her third campaign cycle, though still unsuccessful at claiming the seat, she raised just under $250,000.</p> 
<p>Mamdani may ultimately prove to be the exception rather than the rule. His online success amplified preexisting strengths and allowed his reach to go beyond the five boroughs.</p> 
<p>“Social media is an important part of [the campaign],” Coffey said. “But so is the messaging, and so is the staff, and so was their press apparatus, and so was their candidate's ability to do really hard and tedious work.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top Democratic contenders to succeed Donald Trump in the Oval Office excoriated the president for his overnight strike on Venezuela on Saturday, sharply criticizing the president’s foreign policy and trying to drive a wedge between the president and voters wary of foreign entanglements.</p> 
<p>Trump, they argued, launched the operation to distract from a souring political situation on the home front.</p> 
<p>“It's an old and obvious pattern,” former Transportation Secretary <a href="https://x.com/PeteButtigieg/status/2007499206106185913" target="_blank">Pete Buttigieg wrote on X Saturday</a>. “An unpopular president — failing on the economy and losing his grip on power at home — decides to launch a war for regime change abroad. The American people don’t want to ‘run’ a foreign country while our leaders fail to improve life in this one.”</p> 
<p>It’s a sign of an emerging trendline that could mark both the upcoming midterms and the 2028 elections, as Democrats look to paint Trump as betraying his campaign promises by focusing too much on global affairs rather than domestic issues. </p> 
<p>Trump rode to electoral victory in 2024 under the banner of “America First,” vowing to remove the U.S. from expansive overseas involvement and instead focus on the welfare of U.S. citizens. </p> 
<p>During a press conference Saturday morning at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump defended the Maduro capture as “America First” because “we want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourselves with stability. We want to surround ourselves with energy.”</p> 
<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker argued that Trump should prioritize affordability, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/affordability-affordability-affordability-democrats-new-winning-formula-00637023" target="_blank">a key buzzword that spurred Democratic victories</a> in last November’s off-year elections.</p> 
<p>“Donald Trump’s unconstitutional military action in Venezuela is putting our troops in harm's way with no long-term strategy,” <a href="https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/2007505670988542075" target="_blank">he wrote on X.</a> “The American people deserve a President focused on making their lives more affordable.”</p> 
<p>The operation, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-strikes-venezuela-captures-maduro-trump-says/" target="_blank">Trump announced via Truth Social early Saturday morning</a>, saw U.S. troops capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in their downtown Caracas compound, flying them out of the country. The couple, along with their son, will soon <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/maduro-drug-trafficking-charges-bondi-justice-department-00709639" target="_blank">stand trial on drug trafficking</a> charges.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration, in the meantime, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-victory-lap-raid-maduro-00709641" target="_blank">will “run” Venezuela</a>, Trump announced in the Saturday press conference</p> 
<p>“We'll run it properly,” he said.” “We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world go in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela.”</p> 
<p>Democrats quickly pounced on the president’s actions. Within hours of Maduro’s announced capture, the Democratic National Committee sent out a fundraising email deeming it “another unconstitutional war from Trump, who thinks the Constitution is a suggestion.”</p> 
<p>“Trump promised peace, but has delivered chaos,” the fundraising email, signed by DNC Chair Ken Martin, read. “The most important thing we can do right now is work to elect more Democrats who will check this administration’s power and prevent more disaster.”</p> 
<p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) echoed the message. “We keep voting against dumb wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, &amp; Libya,” <a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/2007444360409808963" target="_blank">he wrote on X</a>. “But our Presidents bow to a foreign policy blob committed to militarism.”</p> 
<p>Other 2028 Democratic contenders — including Arizona Sens. Ruben Gallego and Sen. Mark Kelly, both veterans — condemned the administration’s open-ended approach to their takeover in Venezuela.</p> 
<p>“I lived through the consequences of an illegal war sold to the American people with lies,” <a href="https://x.com/SenRubenGallego/status/2007433155477717121" target="_blank">Gallego wrote on X</a>. “We swore we would never repeat those mistakes. Yet here we are again. The American people did not ask for this, Congress did not authorize this, and our service members should not be sent into harm’s way for another unnecessary conflict.”</p> 
<p>Kelly noted that Maduro is “a brutal, illegitimate dictator who deserves to face justice,” but questioned the U.S.’ end game: “If we learned anything from the Iraq war, it’s that dropping bombs or toppling a leader doesn’t guarantee democracy, stability or make Americans safer,” Kelly <a href="https://x.com/SenMarkKelly/status/2007509794815701037" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p> 
<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pushed back on Trump’s assertion that the Maduro operation was about drug trafficking.</p> 
<p>“If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month,” <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/2007472955882692798" target="_blank">Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X</a>, referencing Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/trump-honduras-pardon-drug-trafficking-00672632" target="_blank">sentenced to decades in an American prison</a> on drug trafficking charges. “It’s about oil and regime change.”</p> 
<p>One potential future Democratic presidential hopeful celebrated Maduro’s capture enthusiastically. "¡Libertad! Today I celebrate with the people of Venezuela in Colorado and elsewhere. The tyrant has fallen!” <a href="https://x.com/jaredpolis/status/2007526727711633788" target="_blank">wrote Colorado Gov. Jared Polis</a>.</p> 
<p>But in a <a href="https://x.com/GovofCO/status/2007524695625859351" target="_blank">separate post</a>, he lamented the lack of insight into "what the plan actually is, or even who is in charge" and urged the White House to "present a clear plan for what a transition to genuine democracy and self-rule entails."</p> 
<p>Republicans waiting in the wings to succeed Trump, however, loudly backed the president’s moves. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, two key administration figures seen as the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/02/im-not-sure-anyone-would-run-against-those-two-how-vance-and-rubio-came-out-on-top-00632381" target="_blank">GOP’s most likely heir apparents</a> once Trump leaves politics, were quick to praise the president on Saturday.</p> 
<p>“The president offered multiple off ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States,” Vance, whose rose to political prominence in part by embracing isolationist tendencies, <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says.”</p> 
<p>“This is a president of action,” Rubio, who has long been more hawkish, said at the Mar-a-Lago press conference.”This is not a president that just talks and does letters and press conferences. And, you know, if he says he's serious about something, he means it.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump’s primary super PAC raised over $102 million in the second half of 2025, carrying a war chest stocked with hundreds of millions of dollars into the midterms.</p> 
<p>That massive sum, combined with even greater fundraising in the first half of the year and minimal spending throughout 2025, leaves the PAC with approximately $300 million cash on hand, positioning the president’s allies to wield massive influence over the midterms.</p> 
<p>The disclosure, which which was reported in <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00892471/1930418" target="_blank">a filing submitted to the Federal Election Commission</a> this week and goes through Dec. 22, shows MAGA Inc. with $294 million cash on hand. In a statement, a MAGA Inc. spokesperson said the PAC ended the year with $304 million cash on hand.</p> 
<p>“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, MAGA Inc will have the resources to help candidates who support President Trump's America First agenda of securing our border, keeping our streets safe, supercharging our economy, and making life more affordable for all Americans,” the organization said.</p> 
<p>The enormous sum of money doesn’t represent the entire war chest at Trump’s disposal; several affiliated PACs have continued to raise money in support of the president, adding to the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/01/trump-fundraising-midterms-00488165" target="_blank">growing stockpile of cash</a> that Republicans around the country will hope to tap into as they seek to maintain majorities in Congress in November.</p> 
<p>MAGA Inc. made its first independent expenditures of the year in support of Rep. Matt Van Epps, who won a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/a-nationalized-tennessee-special-election-has-both-parties-on-edge-00671736" target="_blank">hard-fought special election</a> in Tennessee’s 7th District in December. The super PAC spent $1.6 million to help boost Van Epps over Democrat Aftyn Behn in a district Trump won by 22 points in 2024.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats are accustomed to losing in rural America — especially to Donald Trump. Now they’re hoping the president’s own policies might prove to be the leverage they need going into next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>The party faces immense challenges in farm country that have overwhelmingly voted Republican for decades and turned out in droves on the president’s behalf three times. But over the past year, those same communities have borne the brunt of <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/30/congress/trump-administration-readies-up-to-12-billion-for-initial-farm-aid-payment-00630700" target="_blank">his tariff agenda</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/the-rural-health-hunger-games-are-underway-00563763" target="_blank">health care center closures</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/26/trump-thanksgiving-food-prices-groceries-poll-00669200" target="_blank">lingering inflation</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/12/15/doge-cuts-donald-trump-montana-00681695" target="_blank">cuts to public lands programs</a>.</p> 
<p>Where Trump sees an “A++++++” economy, large percentages of both Republican and Democratic voters blame his decisions for stubbornly high prices for groceries and housing, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/poll-americans-trump-voters-affordability-crisis-00674747" target="_blank">according to recent polling from POLITICO and Public First.</a></p> 
<p>Democrats have a long way to go in rebuilding trust with rural voters. But conversations with more than a dozen current and former Democratic lawmakers, party officials and political strategists suggest they also feel the urgency of tapping into the discontent being generated by Trump’s agenda.</p> 
<p>The party is trying to replace wishful thinking with a new shoe-leather strategy in rural communities where it has long lacked a presence and is deploying unhappy farmers in media campaigns. If Democrats mean to retake Congress in the midterms or have a shot at the White House in 2028, their candidates don't necessarily need to sweep rural counties — they just need to eat into the margins Trump was getting, which were frequently north of 80 percent of the vote.</p> 
<p>“We have a unique opening because of all that's happening with this administration,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/413257" target="_blank">Nikki Budzinski</a> (D-Ill.), whose district includes significant rural and farming interests. Farmers and rural voters “might be listening in a more unique way than they maybe have ever in the past. And we need to walk through that door.”</p> 
<p>Democrats have previously dedicated relatively modest amounts of money, staff and advertising to rural counties and districts outside of swing states. But after a string of off-year victories last month, House Democrats have launched <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/democrats-eye-gains-with-rural-voters-voters-of-color-ahead-of-2026-00667746" target="_blank">their first-ever rural outreach program</a>, an eight-figure campaign that will fund efforts to hire staffers for candidates, mobilize voters and run ads focusing on the cost of living.</p> 
<p>Even some Republicans acknowledge the GOP can’t take rural communities for granted.</p> 
<p>“Right now, the farm community is with [Trump]. I think the thing that Republicans should worry about is enthusiasm, in getting out and actually voting,” Senate Agriculture Committee Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51287" data-person-id="51287">John Boozman</a> (R-Ark.) said. “It's one thing to be supportive, it's another thing to actually go vote on Election Day.”<br></p><p>Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent former senator and governor, won six statewide races running as a Democrat in solid-red West Virginia. He said the party needs to focus on finding candidates who can relate to rural Americans by focusing on key issues — “common sense shit,” he explained, like fiscal responsibility and affordability.</p> 
<p>For example, candidates like Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/16/economy-voters-new-jersey-virginia-midterms-trump-00693015" target="_blank">won their gubernatorial elections last month</a> by distancing themselves from the Democratic Party’s brand and zeroing in on high prices. </p> 
<p>“They're the kind of the centrist Democrats you need,” Manchin said. “They're the only ones who are going to win in these tough areas.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium is-centered">The tariff play</h5> 
<p>The politics that defines much of the division between urban and rural voters <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2024/02/22/they-surveyed-10-000-rural-voters-heres-what-they-learned-00142795" target="_blank">emerged in the late 1980s</a>, as post-Carter Democrats pushed policies that the latter saw as detrimental to agricultural and manufacturing sectors. That left rural voters especially primed for Trump’s brand of economic populism: He won 64 percent of them in 2024, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/21/nx-s1-5198616/2024-presidential-election-results-republican-shift" target="_blank">the best performance of any presidential candidate</a> in decades and beating his own 2016 margin.</p> 
<p>"One of the reasons we were in such a negative place with rural voters is we sort of ceded that ground, stopped showing up, stopped talking to these folks, and really relied on the urban centers," Libby Schneider, deputy executive director of the Democratic National Committee, said. “And we saw how that gamble failed in 2024 when folks in urban centers stayed home.”</p> 
<p>Then, in April, Trump began his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/trump-tariff-trade-partners-liberation-day-00267350" target="_blank">chaotic&nbsp;tariff rollout.</a></p> 
<p>While farmers had stomached Trump’s tariffs in the first term — and voted to bring him back in 2024 — their economic position is weaker and the tariffs are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/farmers-tariffs-trump-trade-war-00271146" target="_blank">much higher and more expansive this time around.</a> </p> 
<p>Farmers and businesses experienced whiplash as tariff deadlines came and went, confusing people throughout the food supply chain about how they would be impacted. Fertilizer and fuel costs rose and markets for exports like soybeans dried up. Some groups, including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/27/like-eggs-part-two-trump-administration-scrambles-to-bring-down-beef-prices-00622680" target="_blank">cattle ranchers who have long allied with Trump</a>, publicly broke with the president's trade agenda when he suggested importing Argentinian beef to lower food prices.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/02/95/84e671e64b4db05a09327f90e7c2/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2242299726" alt="A combine harvests soybeans on Oct. 14, 2025, in Marion, Kentucky.

"/><p>While most rural voters are not farmers, agriculture is a critical piece of the rural economy, making farm policy one of the primary ways federal policymaking affects those communities. Some voters may support tariffs in theory in the hopes they could revitalize the labor market and prompt fairer trade terms for farm goods, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/poll-affordability-cost-of-living-00678076" target="_blank">polling suggests&nbsp;they&nbsp;view&nbsp;Trump's&nbsp;plans&nbsp;as&nbsp;too&nbsp;arbitrary</a> to achieve those goals.</p> 
<p>A majority of people surveyed in an October POLITICO poll (53 percent) supported avoiding tariffs on imports if that meant keeping costs low for consumers.</p> 
<p>Spanberger, the Virginia governor-elect, won in part by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/30/democrats-rural-voters-tight-virginia-governor-race-00628974" target="_blank">focusing her messaging in rural counties</a> on tariffs and tying the economic discomfort voters were feeling to Trump and the Republican Party. She outperformed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/06/democrats-spanberger-wins-rural-voters-00641266" target="_blank">Kamala Harris in 48 of Virginia’s 52 rural localities.</a></p> 
<p>National Democrats, excited by Spanberger’s success, have made their own moves: Beyond the DCCC’s eight-figure investment into rural voters and voters of color and the new farmer-focused ad campaigns, a caucus of more than 100 moderate Democratic lawmakers recently released a policy agenda that includes passing a farm bill, expanding rural broadband funding and federal funding for local food purchases.</p> 
<p>White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the Trump administration’s policies and said “supporting rural Americans has been a key focus,” which is why the administration has sought to use tariffs to open up new export markets for farmers.</p> 
<p>The RNC isn’t fazed either.</p> 
<p>"Rural America won't suddenly be tricked into thinking elite Democrats stand for their beliefs and values. The DNC spending a few bucks won't fool rural Americans into thinking Democrats have touched grass,” RNC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium is-centered">One Big Beautiful Mess</h5> 
<p>Trump’s signature tax-and-spending law provides Democrats with another opening to contrast their pitch against Republicans.</p> 
<p>Rural health care centers across the country have already shuttered in response to the law’s Medicaid cuts, which will disproportionately hit communities where hospitals are few and often primary employers. Low-income Americans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/15/food-stamps-snap-trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-impact-00653447" target="_blank">are quickly learning they may no&nbsp;longer qualify</a> for federal food aid — even as most of the tax breaks the GOP has touted <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/12/congress/gop-megabill-cbo-distributional-effects-00402674" target="_blank">will benefit the wealthy.</a></p> 
<p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association and represents a ruby red state, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/11/24/andy-beshear-democrats-politics-rural-voters/" target="_blank">recently called</a> the law “a slap in the face to rural America.”</p> 
<p>And POLITICO’s November poll revealed that voters are more likely to rely on Democrats when it comes to health care policy. More than 40 percent of those surveyed said they trusted Democrats to bring down health care costs for ordinary Americans, compared with 33 percent who said they trusted the GOP.</p> 
<p>The message for Democrats is “wrapped up and with a nice, tidy bow on it in the Big, Beautiful Bill,” said Christopher Borick, a political science professor who runs the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “It's cuts to your health care, it's cuts to rural hospitals. It's cuts to SNAP benefits, and it's just so tidy and neat for Democrats to go there.”</p> 
<p>The strategy seems to be working. In a heavily Republican congressional district in Tennessee, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/tennessee-aftyn-behn-matt-van-epps-democrats-00674118" target="_blank">Democrat Aftyn Behn&nbsp;beat expectations</a> and outperformed Harris' 2024 margins in a bid to unseat GOP Rep. Matt Van Epps this month.</p> 
<p>Behn’s ads largely focused on affordability and the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which she called the “<a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/10/22/behn-works-to-counter-trump-endorsement-of-van-epps-in-tennessees-congressional-district-7/" target="_blank">one big BS bill</a>.”</p> 
<p>That tactic resonated with voters in an off-cycle election and will only gain steam: Americans' health care premiums are set to skyrocket ahead of the 2026 midterms after Republicans declined to extend Covid-era “enhanced” subsidies of Affordable Care Act plans in their big bill.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium is-centered">Will history repeat itself?</h5> 
<p>Still, some political experts question how much Democrats can loosen the GOP's hold on rural America.</p> 
<p>The president's first-term tariff war also hammered farmers, but their political ties to Republicans hardly wavered at the time. Democrats in 2024 used roughly the same playbook they’re seeking to capitalize on now, arguing that Trump’s proposed policies would increase the cost of living and that his tariffs would impose a new tax on the middle class — but they failed to gain enough ground with rural voters, enabling Republicans to win a trifecta.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/b7/68/b89e4f2242b6b99b24f895a2a797/unlimiteduse-12-08-2025-white-house-isp-0006.jpg" alt="Trump listens during a roundtable discussion where he announced a $12 billion aid plan for farmers on Dec. 8, 2025." data-portal-copyright="Yuri Gripas/Abaca" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="Trump listens during a roundtable discussion where he announced a $12 billion aid plan for farmers on Dec. 8, 2025."/><p>Many voters are wary of Democrats’ support for free trade agreements over the last 30 years, which hollowed out rural job opportunities and allowed the unchecked growth of corporate power, said Anthony Flaccavento, executive director of the Rural Urban Bridge initiative, a progressive rural organizing group.</p> 
<p>“Both parties have really betrayed rural America, but the Republican Party got very, very good at seeing people and expressing solidarity and saying, ‘You're right to be angry,'” he explained.</p> 
<p>Part of winning is showing up and listening, say Democrats like Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/404824" data-person-id="404824">Shontel Brown</a> of Ohio, who is weighing a bid for the top spot on the House Agriculture Committee. Brown, who hails from a wholly urban district, has traveled to other parts of her state and to Florida on a listening tour to hear directly from farmers.</p> 
<p>“We've lost a lot of trust in rural America, so showing up and listening is half the battle, but then we have to be able to present an alternative,” she said in a recent interview. "We as Democrats have a real opportunity to make the case for policies that lower costs and make it easier for farmers, families and the entire food supply chain producers as well.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/09/fe/9924b69049528c59b725388163e0/dsc-0790.JPG" alt="Brown visited several farms outside her district in northern Ohio over the summer.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota has been the white whale for Republicans in the Trump era. And 2026 could be the year they finally break through — if President Donald Trump and one of the most prolific peddlers of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election don’t sink their chances.</p> 
<p>Republicans are growing optimistic about their chances of unseating Democratic Gov. Tim Walz next year, as he seeks a historic third term. But Trump’s increasingly caustic attacks on Walz and disparagement of Minnesota’s Somali community — and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell’s entrance into the gubernatorial race — could hurt Republicans’ chances of regaining ground in the state, some party strategists argue.</p> 
<p>“When the president comes in with a flamethrower and just throws that type of rhetoric, there's no oxygen, and there's no space for the Republican to offer suggestions and to be thoughtful in that space, because the rhetoric of the president just paints them into a corner,” said Michael Brodkorb, a former deputy chair of the Minnesota GOP who backed the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p> 
<p>Republicans have insisted they can be competitive statewide in the blue-leaning Minnesota ever since Trump lost Minnesota by less than 2 points in 2016. But since then, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/17/donald-trump-flip-minnesota-00158551" target="_blank">winning the state has beguiled</a> both the president — who faced a 7-point loss in 2020 and a 4-point loss in 2024 — and Republicans in other statewide races, including two fairly comfortable wins for Walz in 2018 and 2022.</p> 
<p>Still, Republicans see an opportunity to win back the Minnesota governor’s seat for the first time since 2006 by hammering Walz, who is running despite scrutiny into his oversight of state benefits and a star turn as the Democratic vice presidential nominee that put him in the crosshairs of Republicans across the country.</p> 
<p>At the same time, Trump has also used the arrests of some Somali immigrants in federal fraud cases to broadly characterize the state’s Somali population as criminals — leaning on his trademark use of divisive rhetoric that some Republicans worry will fall flat.</p> 
<p>That risk, insiders warn, could be exacerbated if Lindell, a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/11/mike-lindell-minnesota-governor-race-00686859" target="_blank">Trump ally</a>, wins the Republican nomination.</p> 
<p>“We’d be cooked,” said Dustin Grage, a Minnesota Republican strategist. “I’d be moving to Florida very shortly. We would lose pretty badly if Mike Lindell were to get the nomination.”</p> 
<p>Those close to the president strenuously disagree, arguing the state remains on the map. House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, the most high-profile Minnesota Republican and an ally of the president, said he’s spoken to Trump about the governor’s race and is confident that any of the 13 Republicans seeking the party’s nomination could defeat Walz.</p> 
<p>“We should be able to beat Tim Walz with a dog,” Emmer told POLITICO in an interview. </p> 
<p>The White House declined to comment. At a rally in North Carolina on Friday, Trump praised Lindell and said he “deserves to be the governor of Minnesota.” </p> 
<p>Walz faces a tricky path to reelection, with no Minnesota governor winning three consecutive terms in the state’s history. That’s been made more difficult by several investigations during his tenure leading the state that revealed a ring of alleged fraudsters siphoning money from public programs. In 2022, federal prosecutors charged dozens of people for pocketing $250 million from a federally funded child nutrition program overseen by the Minnesota Department of Education during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> 
<p>The massive scope of the fraud allegations (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/feeding-our-future-defendant-sentenced-10-years-prison" target="_blank">the Justice Department called it</a> the “largest Covid-19 fraud scheme in the United States”) triggered a state audit that found the Walz administration “did not effectively exercise its authority” to prevent the fraud.</p> 
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/defendants-charged-first-wave-housing-stabilization-fraud-cases" target="_blank">federal prosecutors charged eight people</a> with defrauding a Minnesota housing and health benefits program of millions of dollars by submitting inflated and fake reimbursement claims. Six additional people were charged for participating in the scheme in December. That same month, a defendant previously charged in the pandemic program fraud <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/six-additional-defendants-charged-one-defendant-pleads-guilty-ongoing-fraud-schemes" target="_blank">pleaded guilty to attempting to steal $14 million</a> from a Minnesota health care program that offers services to children with autism.</p> 
<p>Prosecutors have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/us/minnesota-fraud-scandal.html" target="_blank">broadened their inquiry</a> into benefits fraud in the state to investigate billions of dollars in flagged billings of 14 public programs supported by Medicaid. </p> 
<p>In response to a request for comment to a Walz spokesperson, Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chair Richard Carlbom said in a statement that Walz “heads into reelection with a record focused squarely on working people and kitchen-table issues.” </p> 
<p>“While the GOP clown-car primary remains consumed by infighting and loyalty tests for Donald Trump, Minnesota families are falling behind as Republicans unleash higher grocery prices, skyrocketing health care bills, and giant tax breaks for billionaires,” Carlbom said. “Minnesotans see the difference — a governor delivering for working families, or Republicans delivering loyalty to Donald Trump and a Washington agenda that puts billionaires first.”</p> 
<p>In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up his efforts to link Walz to the abuse of government programs — while using incendiary rhetoric directed at the governor and the Somali community. In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115625429081411360" target="_blank">social media post</a> on Thanksgiving, he called Walz “seriously retarded” and accused Somali refugees of seeking to “prey” on Minnesotans. And at an early December rally in Pennsylvania, he again denigrated the Somali community while discussing “the great big Minnesota scam with one of the dumbest governors ever in history.”</p> 
<p>Emmer, who said he spoke with Trump about the governor’s race as early as July, said he believes the president recognizes an opportunity in Walz’s vulnerability. “I think the president knows that Tim Walz is the weakest he's ever been in his political career,” Emmer said.</p> 
<p>Former Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt, a Republican, said the fraud investigations are part of the risk for Walz in seeking a third consecutive term.</p> 
<p>“If you can lay out a case that, ‘Well, you've been elected now for eight years, and you haven't fixed these problems,’ or ‘You haven't accomplished what you said you were going to’ … it kind of makes it an easier case to say, ‘Maybe it's time for someone new,’” Daudt said.</p> 
<p>But the rhetoric Trump is using to highlight the fraud may reframe the issue to the detriment of Walz’s Republican opponent, said Brodkorb,the former party official. He believes Minnesotans are eager to weigh ideas on immigration policy and how to tackle abuse of public programs.</p> 
<p>“The problem is when the president comes in and says things like, ‘Everyone in the entire Somali community is garbage,’” Brodkorb said.</p> 
<p>Emmer, who adamantly defended Trump’s approach and his rhetoric attacking both Walz and the Somali community, credited him with shining a light on the state.</p> 
<p>“If he hadn't said it exactly the way it is, and if he hadn't been so out there direct, guess what? Nobody would have covered it,” Emmer said.</p> 
<p>The barrage directed at Walz and the state — including attacks from Trump allies, targeted probes from Cabinet officials and an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis — underscores the governor’s newfound national prominence since campaigning as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in last year’s presidential race.</p> 
<p>Walz has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/08/tim-walz-2024-campaign-critiques-00219718" target="_blank">emerged as a vocal critic</a> of the second Trump administration, prompting a feud between the two. After a Democratic lawmaker was killed by a gunman and a second was seriously injured earlier this year, Trump said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/17/trump-walz-phone-call-00410141" target="_blank">he would not “waste time” calling</a> the “whacked out” governor.</p> 
<p>Walz’s growing national profile both makes him a high-profile target in the 2026 midterms worthy of trying to defeat, GOP strategists say — but Trump’s intense focus on the race could also backfire given the state’s political makeup.</p> 
<p>“Having Donald Trump being active in the race for a particular Republican may not be helpful, but it would be extremely helpful to raise the attention on Tim Walz and his record here in the state,” Daudt said.</p> 
<p>And if Trump’s ends up throwing his weight behind Lindell — who conspired with Trump in 2020 to advance false claims that the presidential election was stolen — Republicans worry that could give Walz a clearer path to reelection.</p> 
<p>“If [Lindell] is the candidate, that’s what the election will be about,” Daudt said. “It'll definitely be easier for Walz to make the election about Trump if Mike Lindell is the candidate. No question.”</p> 
<p>Trump, who continues to claim the 2020 election was rigged, touted Lindell’s efforts to reverse the election results at the North Carolina rally, and empathized with how Lindell “suffered” as a result. </p> 
<p>"He was just a guy that said, ’This election was so crooked, it was so rigged.’ He fought like hell," Trump told his supporters.</p> 
<p>Lindell’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. </p> 
<p>Some Minnesota Republicans hope that the party will back a more moderate candidate that can highlight Walz’s vulnerabilities.</p> 
<p>But Emmer said candidates should do what they can to win the endorsement of the hundreds of highly engaged party activists who serve as delegates at the party’s nominating convention next year.</p> 
<p>“I'm going to tell you the way you win this race. You go run your race to get an endorsement,” Emmer said. “As soon as you are the endorsed Republican candidate, you have won the primary in August, you are going to win the governor's race.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After five years in the United States Senate, Republican Tommy Tuberville wants Alabamians to know one thing above all else as he embarks on a gubernatorial bid: his time as a college football coach.</p> 
<p>That his <a href="https://www.coachforgovernor.com/" target="_blank">campaign website is framed</a> by a banner reading “Coach Tuberville for Governor” speaks to how much the GOP is relying upon local sports heroes to compete for offices up and down the ballot as the pivotal midterm elections approach.</p> 
<p>Athletes and coaches are playing in some of the highest-profile races of the 2026 cycle, with control over Congress up for grabs in a year <a href="https://x.com/PpollingNumbers/status/2003110092598841398" target="_blank">expected to favor Democrats</a>. In Georgia, former University of Tennessee head coach Derek Dooley is hoping to capitalize on his athletic experience — and his <a href="https://georgiadogs.com/news/2022/10/28/football-former-uga-coach-athletic-director-vince-dooley-dies" target="_blank">father’s football fame</a> in Athens — to break through in a competitive Republican primary and unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. Former NFL kicker Jay Feely is running for Congress in Arizona. And former MLB star Mark Teixeira is a front-runner for Rep. Chip Roy’s open House seat in Texas.</p> 
<p>Tuberville, who once led the Auburn University football team, still goes by “coach” around the Capitol.</p> 
<p>Athletes-turned-politicians are hardly a new concept: former Rep. Jack Kemp brought his football background to the halls of Congress and the 1996 GOP presidential ticket; Jesse Ventura leveraged his WWE fame to win Minnesota’s governorship; and two-time NBA champion Bill Bradley served New Jersey in the Senate for nearly two decades and mounted a bid for the White House.</p> 
<p>But at a moment of deep distrust and disdain for elected officials in Washington, both parties are looking for outsider candidates and athletes are increasingly fitting that mold. And the trend of leveraging sports fame for political gain has been supercharged in the era of Trump, who once owned a pro football team. The president has routinely campaigned alongside athletes and coaches, including Notre Dame hero Lou Holtz — whom he later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom — and professional wrestling star Hulk Hogan. He backed Tuberville in his Senate run and endorsed former University of Georgia star running back Herschel Walker in his unsuccessful Senate bid in 2022.</p> 
<p>This trend has been especially prevalent in the southeast, where college football culture reigns. Tuberville’s successful entrance into politics has inspired a new crop of football figures to make their own bids as Republicans in the SEC corridor, and many of them have consulted directly with the coach-turned-legislator about how to replicate his win.</p> 
<p>Tuberville used his gridiron fame in Alabama to rocket to the Senate in 2020 without any experience in the public eye off the football field.</p> 
<p>“I spent a lot of time in public life going to a lot of alumni meetings, shaking hands, marketing our program, selling recruits on the road, dealing a lot with parents — and it's no different than being in politics,” he said in an interview.</p> 
<p>The party in Alabama isn’t making an active push to recruit former sports stars to run for office, but that hasn’t stopped other like-minded college athletes and sports figures from running their own plays for office.</p> 
<p>“I think there's a natural bend towards these figures,” said Alabama Republican Party Chair John Wahl, who worked on Tuberville’s 2020 Senate campaign. “They already have some name I.D., they have fundraising capabilities, but they're seen as political outsiders and people who are going to represent the average, everyday American.”</p> 
<p>Dooley, who is running for Senate with the backing of Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, approached Tuberville for some coaching prior to his run.</p> 
<p>“The people that have called me, they ask: what is this? What do I have to do? And what does it entail? You know, first of all, being a senator, they all want to know first about campaigning. They want to know the ins and outs of it and what you have to do with raising money,” Tuberville said.</p> 
<p>Dooley’s campaign did not make him available for an interview for this article.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, former University of Alabama star quarterback AJ McCarron launched his own bid for lieutenant governor — opening the possibility that, alongside Tuberville, the state could have been helmed by figures representing rival local football programs. He ended his bid on Wednesday, announcing he would no longer seek Montgomery’s second-in-command post “in order to accept a new career opportunity in football.”</p> 
<p>Paul Finebaum, the lauded college football commentator, <a href="https://www.al.com/politics/2025/12/paul-finebaum-will-not-run-for-tubervilles-us-senate-seat.html" target="_blank">passed on a run</a> for Tuberville’s seat earlier this month. He, too, spoke with the senator about the job as he was exploring a run, according to Tuberville. So did fellow Auburn Tigers basketball coach Bruce Pearl, who similarly opted against a bid after retiring from coaching.</p> 
<p>But there will still be plenty of ‘Bama pride left: Sen. Katie Britt’s (R-Ala.) husband Wesley Britt starred for the Crimson Tide before playing three seasons in the NFL, a fact she was sure to highlight in her ads during her 2022 run for Senate.</p> 
<p>This same trend is playing out in other parts of the country too. Michelle Tafoya, the longtime NFL sideline reporter, is <a href="https://www.startribune.com/michele-tafoya-inches-closer-to-bid-for-us-senate/601547959" target="_blank">inching toward mounting a bid</a> as a Republican in Minnesota’s open Senate race. Meanwhile, Democrats have yet to significantly capitalize on that same trend in the deep-red part of the country to challenge the Republicans’ regional hegemony.</p> 
<p>That isn’t to say they don’t have a bench elsewhere: former Rep. Colin Allred leaned hard on his bio as an NFL player in his unsuccessful 2024 Senate bid in Texas (he’s now running for his old seat). Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healy played a few years of professional basketball in Europe before returning to the Bay State to launch her political career. Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kansas) is a former professional mixed martial arts fighter.</p> 
<p>“Democrats tend to recruit a lot of ex-military or CIA people. They seem to think that’s more in their wheelhouse,” said long-time Democratic strategist James Carville.</p> 
<p>“I think as people become increasingly turned off by ‘politics of Washington, ’you’re going to find these parties are going to be looking for different kinds of candidates,” he continued. “It might be a good idea to look for more opportunities like this.”</p> 
<p>Nearly three-quarters of American adults are “frustrated” by the Democratic Party, an October <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/10/30/how-americans-feel-about-the-republican-and-democratic-parties/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center poll</a> found. Sixty-four percent of Americans held similarly negative views of Republicans. That dissatisfaction makes the appeal of an outsider candidate who hasn’t touched politics before even stronger.</p> 
<p>“I think people are ready for change,” said Amanda Litman, the co-founder and president of the progressive candidate recruitment organization Run for Something. “Often the best folks to shepherd that change are people who are new to the system, whether that's new to politics or new to community engagement.”</p> 
<p>“I wouldn't say athletes is, like, a specific profile we're looking for, because you have to be really in it to solve a problem,” she continued, adding that wants to see “more artists, I want more musicians, and I want more nurses and teachers to run for office. I want more people who really care and who maybe come with a fresh perspective.”</p> 
<p>While outsider candidates may prove a balm to those fiery sentiments, the public is not entirely sold on athletes wading into a political space. A late 2024 <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/most-adults-feel-the-need-to-limit-political-news-consumption-due-to-fatigue-and-information-overload/" target="_blank">poll conducted by the Associated Press and the NORC at the University of Chicago</a> showed that 26 percent of adults approve of athletes speaking out about political issues. 36 percent of respondents said they explicitly disapprove of athletes specifically sharing their political opinions.</p> 
<p>“When you’re famous in athletics, everybody likes you,” Carville said. “In politics, as soon as you open your mouth, half the people hate you.”<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wyoming GOP Rep. Harriet Hageman on Tuesday announced her campaign for Senate, hoping to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis in next year’s election.</p> 
<p>The Wyoming Republican is a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, and with his backing she helped oust Republican then-Rep. Liz Cheney, a vocal critic of Trump’s, in the 2022 primary.</p> 
<p>"This fight is about making sure the next century sees the advancements of the last, while protecting our culture and our way of life,” Hageman said in her launch video. “We must dedicate ourselves to ensuring that the next 100 years is the next great American century."</p> 
<p>Lummis <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/19/cynthia-lummis-crypto-retirement-00700961" target="_blank">announced she would not seek reelection</a> last week, saying she felt like a “sprinter in a marathon” despite being a “devout legislator.” Hageman, who had been debating a gubernatorial bid, was expected to enter the Senate race.</p> 
<p>Hageman touted her ties to the president in her announcement video, highlighting her record of support for Trump’s policies during her time in the House and vowing to keep Wyoming a “leader in energy and food production.”</p> 
<p>“I worked with President Trump to pass 46 billion in additional funding for border security, while ensuring that Wyomingites do not pay the cost of new immigration. We work together to secure the border and fund efforts to remove and deport those in the country illegally,” she said.</p> 
<p>President Trump on Tuesday said Hageman has his "complete and total" endorsement, calling her "highly respected" in a post to Truth Social. </p> 
<p>"I know Harriet well, and she is a TOTAL WINNER!" Trump said. He added that Hageman "WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN."</p> 
<p>Trump won the deep-red state by nearly 46 points in last year’s election, and Hageman herself was reelected by nearly 48 points, according to exit polling.</p> 
<p>Still, Hageman bore the brunt of voters’ displeasure earlier this year during a town hall. As she spoke of the Department of Government Efficiency, federal cuts and Social Security, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-lawmaker-booed-rowdy-town-hall-complaining-crowd-obsessed-g-rcna197278" target="_blank">the crowd booed her</a>.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Sen. Ben Sasse announced on Tuesday that he has been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer.</p> 
<p>The Nebraska Republican shared the news on X, writing in a <a href="https://x.com/bensasse/status/2003483746540965891?s=46" target="_blank">lengthy social media post</a> that he had received the diagnosis last week.</p> 
<p>“Advanced pancreatic is nasty stuff; it’s a death sentence,” Sasse said. “But I already had a death sentence before last week too — we all do.”</p> 
<p>The two term senator retired in 2023 and then went on to serve as president of the University of Florida. He eventually left the school to spend more time with his wife, Melissa, after she was diagnosed with epilepsy.</p> 
<p>Sasse continued to teach classes at University of Florida’s Hamilton Center after he stepped down as president. He previously served as a professor at the University of Texas, as an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services and as president of Midland University.</p> 
<p>Sasse on Tuesday shared that he and his wife have only grown closer since and opened up about his children’s recent successes and milestones.</p> 
<p>“There’s not a good time to tell your peeps you’re now marching to the beat of a faster drummer — but the season of advent isn’t the worst,” Sasse said. “As a Christian, the weeks running up to Christmas are a time to orient our hearts toward the hope of what’s to come.”</p> 
<p>Sasse said he’ll have more to share in the future, adding that he is “not going down without a fight” and will be undergoing treatment.</p> 
<p>“Death and dying aren’t the same — the process of dying is still something to be lived. We’re zealously embracing a lot of gallows humor in our house, and I’ve pledged to do my part to run through the irreverent tape,” Sasse said.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unreliable. Creating more problems than solving them. A negative force on the world stage. This is how large shares of America's closest allies view the U.S., according to new polling, as President Donald Trump pursues a sweeping foreign policy overhaul.</p> 
<p>Pluralities in Germany and France — and a majority of Canadians — say the U.S. is a negative force globally, according to new international <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019b-47e5-d651-a1ff-7fe532280000" target="_blank">POLITICO-Public First polling</a>. Views are more mixed in the United Kingdom, but more than a third of respondents there share that dim assessment.<br></p><p>Near-majorities in all four countries also say the U.S. tends to create problems for other countries rather than solve them.<br></p><p>The findings offer a snapshot of how Trump’s reshaping of U.S. foreign policy — including through an expansive trade agenda, sharp rhetoric toward longtime allies and reoriented military posture — is resonating across some of Washington's closest allies.</p> 
<p>When asked whether the U.S. supports its allies around the world or challenges them, a majority of Canadians say the latter, as well as just under half of respondents in Germany and France. In the U.K., roughly 4 in 10 say the U.S. challenges, rather than supports, its allies, more than a third say it cannot be depended on in a crisis, nearly half say it creates problems for other countries, and 35 percent say the U.S. is a negative force overall.<br></p><p>Trump has blurred traditional lines of global alliances during his first year back in office, particularly in Canada and Europe. He called Europe a “decaying” group of nations led by “weak” people in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trump-dasha-burns-interview-europe-immigration-ukraine-00682016?amp" target="_blank">recent POLITICO interview</a> and his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/05/trump-reveals-national-security-strategy-western-hemisphere-europe-00678265?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8eihOUWYhQ6oo5DPvTgulJR88nC7bqkNAYITjeYtmCxbIR-Ax2MF5ulAOf8vUu51wbzDiM7-dY1jdBHhwfhHFOcACqGQ&amp;_hsmi=393131806&amp;utm_campaign=AFSA+Media+Digest&amp;utm_content=393131806&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">sweeping National Security Strategy</a>argued that the continent has lost its “national identities and self-confidence." </p> 
<p>By contrast, the strategy reserved less scathing language for Russia — even as U.S. allies in Europe gear up for what leaders have called a “hybrid war” with Moscow.</p> 
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the administration’s approach when asked about European criticisms, saying the transatlantic alliance remains rooted in shared “civilizational” values. “I do think that at the core of these special relationships we have is the fact that we have shared history, shared values, shared civilizational principles that we should be unapologetic about,” <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/12/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-remarks-to-the-press-6/" target="_blank">Rubio said at a briefing</a> last week.<br></p><p>But as Trump disrupts long-standing relationships, skepticism among allied leaders may be seeping into public sentiment, said Matthew Kroenig, vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.</p> 
<p>“Public opinion in democracies often reflects elite opinion,” he said. “What you're probably seeing there is that you do have politicians in these countries expressing skepticism about the United States and about the Trump administration, and that's being reflected in the public opinion polling.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Leaders across Europe and Canada recalibrate under Trump’s foreign policy agenda</h5> 
<p>That dynamic is playing out across Europe and Canada, as leaders across the countries try to keep the increasingly strained relationships intact.</p> 
<p>In Germany, wavering U.S. military support for Ukraine, questions about Washington’s commitment to NATO and Trump's tariff war have added urgency for Chancellor Friedrich Merz to move beyond the country’s long-established limits on defense spending and economic policy. Weeks before taking office, Merz secured a historic spending overhaul that unlocked hundreds of billions of euros for defense and infrastructure investments after years of self-imposed austerity.</p> 
<p>“Every foreign policy statement by Trump is followed closely, and often discussed in light of what it may mean for U.S. policy shifts regarding European security issues, such as commitment to NATO, future U.S. troop presence in Europe, and support for Ukraine,” said Dominik Tolksdorf, a transatlantic expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations.</p> 
<p>In France, where skepticism toward the U.S. has long run deep, President Emmanuel Macron has pursued personal diplomacy with Trump while using the president’s unpredictability to bolster arguments for greater European strategic autonomy.</p> 
<p>“Handing over one’s sovereignty to another power is a mistake — De Gaulle said nothing else,” one high-ranking French military officer, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, told POLITICO. Another defense official said Trump’s National Security Strategy had increased “awareness that something is not right.”</p> 
<p>In the U.K., Trump remains polarizing, but Prime Minister Keir Starmer has largely avoided public confrontation. His priorities now include finalizing a U.K.-U.S. trade deal and coordinating a European response to Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine — without angering the White House, the delicate balance many allied leaders are trying to strike.</p> 
<p>Canada, meanwhile, has seen the sharpest deterioration in relations, which have soured amid a punishing trade war and Trump's intermittent rhetoric on annexation.</p> 
<p>Flavio Volpe, the president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, described the economic disruption linked to Trump's trade moves. "People lost their jobs — ones they worked their entire lives — and billions of dollars in Canadian capital evaporated in an unexplainable turn away from the bankable post-Cold War balance of power by the White House," he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/flaviovolpe1_what-a-year-2025-was-as-canadians-we-activity-7407791627521519616-b5LP/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABluvCsBEHsx7-Lm-VkyQj40GhzivWTt5Ns" target="_blank">wrote on LinkedIn</a>.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Democrats remain skeptical of the U.S. on the world stage</h5> 
<p>Overall, Americans still view their country more favorably than their allies do. Nearly half — 49 percent — say the U.S. supports its allies around the world. A majority, 52 percent, say it can be depended on in a crisis, and 51 percent say the U.S. is a positive force globally.</p> 
<p>But Democrats — who have displayed deeply pessimistic views about their country since Trump’s return to office — hold far more negative views.<br></p><p>Almost half of voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris last year — 47 percent — also say the U.S. is a negative force in the world overall, compared with just 13 percent of Trump voters. Three in four Trump voters say the U.S. is a positive force in the world.<br></p><p>Many Democrats also don’t just express skepticism about the U.S., but view other countries and international blocs as stronger models: 58 percent of Harris voters say the European Union is a positive force in the world, and nearly two-thirds — 64 percent — say the same about Canada, greater than the shares who say the same about the U.S.</p> 
<p>"This tracks with our other research on the rapid change of perceptions of the U.S. over the last year,” said Seb Wride, head of polling at Public First. “Americans themselves are not blind to it.”</p> 
<p>Prior to the 2024 election, strong majorities of both Democrats and Republicans — 71 percent and 69 percent — said the U.S. was a positive force in the world over the course of its entire history, Public First polling from October of last year found.</p> 
<p>Exactly one year later, Democrats have sharply changed their views, with 77 percent of Trump voters still saying the U.S. is positive, compared with just 58 percent of Democrats.</p> 
<p>“That's around 1 in 8 Democrats changing their views on the role the U.S. has played in its entire history, in just one year,” said Wride.</p> 
<p>Voters who backed Trump last November overwhelmingly view the U.S. in a positive light, but subtle differences emerge within his coalition. Eighty-one percent of self-identifying MAGA Trump voters say the U.S. is a positive force in the world overall, compared with 71 percent of non-MAGA Trump voters. Still, 17 percent of non-MAGA Trump voters say the opposite, that the U.S. is a negative force.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than a dozen staffers at The Heritage Foundation are leaving the conservative think tank to join a nonprofit led by former Vice President Mike Pence as the embattled organization continues to reel from ongoing turmoil.</p> 
<p>Advancing American Freedom — founded by Pence in 2021 “to defend liberty and advance policies that build a stronger America” — <a href="https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/advancing-american-freedom-hires-former-heritage-foundation-legal-economic-and-data-directors/" target="_blank">announced Monday</a> that three senior officials who led the legal, economic and data teams at Heritage would be joining the group next year, along with several members of their teams.</p> 
<p>The departures, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/top-heritage-officials-flee-to-mike-pences-nonprofit-as-think-tank-fractures-28765f2b?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcWRThC3x5OjMZyiJ-EWHqZOh48xjVQlICADo_PMYgxHFS3C-BE_hliCGyNfJI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69498dc6&amp;gaa_sig=2vxAcz6a-QYutN710Zs7HtrLH9cM7ZhPTUxPoGZOegAUzGftuMSG4ZwXCk-SGeVw-VE47zZOspvRP4OV02a1sA%3D%3D" target="_blank">first reported by The Wall Street Journal</a>, mark the latest sign of upheaval at Heritage, which has seen <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/heritage-resigns-robert-george-tucker-00654143" target="_blank">dozens of staffers flee the organization</a> since it became <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/30/heritage-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-00631200" target="_blank">engulfed in a scandal</a> involving Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and the ongoing debate within the conservative movement over antisemitism.</p> 
<p>Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, the architect behind the “Project 2025” blueprint for President Donald Trump’s second administration, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/mcconnell-heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson-00631510" target="_blank">drew sharp rebukes</a> from conservative voices, including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/ben-shapiro-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-interview-00633323" target="_blank">commentator Ben Shapiro,</a> after standing by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson’s friendly interview with Fuentes in October.</p> 
<p>In the wake of the initial backlash, Roberts told staffers he’d make a “mistake,” but asked for the chance to “clean it up” during a November all-staff meeting, according to a <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/i-made-a-mistake-heritage-foundation-president-apologizes-to-staff-for-video-refusal-to-cancel-tucker-carlson-and-throws-shade-at-former-chief-of-staff/" target="_blank">leaked video</a> first published by the Washington Free Beacon.</p> 
<p>The hires by Advancing American Freedom signal that the organization is looking to position itself as a key player within the broader conservative movement.</p> 
<p>“AAF is honored to welcome these principled conservative scholars to the team,” Pence, who has been the target of Trump’s ire since the former vice president certified the 2020 election results, said in a statement. “They bring a wealth of experience, a love of country, and a deep commitment to the Constitution and Conservative Movement that will further the cause of liberty.”</p> 
<p>Andrew Olivastro, chief advancement officer at The Heritage Foundation, said in a Monday statement that the think tank’s “mission is unchanged, and our leadership is strong and decisive.”</p> 
<p>"Heritage has always welcomed debate, but alignment on mission and loyalty to the institution are non-negotiable. A handful of staff chose a different path — some through disruption, others through disloyalty,” Olivastro said.</p> 
<p>In his statement, Olivastro said several of the departing staffers were “terminated for conduct inconsistent with Heritage's mission and standards” last week, adding that “Their departures clear the way for a stronger, more focused team.”</p> 
<p>Former Heritage Vice President John Malcolm is slated to lead AAF’s new Edwin Meese III Institute for the Rule of Law, which is being relocated from Heritage. Jessica Reinsch, formerly deputy director of programs at the Meese Center, will serve as director of programs, and five other former employees at Heritage will also join AAF’s Meese Institute.</p> 
<p>Five staffers from Heritage’s economic policy institute and its federal budget center will join AAF’s Plymouth Institute for Free Enterprise, and former Heritage’s Chief Statistician Kevin Dayaratna will lead its Center for Statistical Modeling &amp; Scientific Analysis.</p> 
<p>Josh Blackman, a legal scholar who contributed to Project 2025, also resigned his post as senior editor of the Heritage Guide to the Constitution on Sunday. In <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/21/my-resignation-from-the-heritage-foundation/" target="_blank">his resignation letter</a>, Blackman wrote that Roberts’ remarks “were a huge unforced blunder, and gave aid and comfort to the rising tide of antisemitism on the right,” in addition to undermining the work of the Meese Center.</p> 
<p>“Your initial remarks were indefensible. Your apology was underwhelming. And the lack of any meaningful followup over the past three months has been telling,” Blackman wrote in his letter to Roberts.</p> 
<p>Still, some Heritage staffers have remained loyal to the organization, with conservative activist Robby Starbuck sharing Monday that he would be extending his stay as a visiting fellow at the think tank. Starbuck <a href="https://x.com/robbystarbuck/status/2003169958172475556?s=46" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that “these resignations have a lot more to do with 2028 than it does with anything else,” accusing Blackman and others who stepped down of yearning for “a return to the Pence/Ryan GOP.”</p> 
<p>The shock waves from the infighting at Heritage, once a key player in the MAGA coalition, have continued to reverberate throughout the GOP, with Republican firebrands like Carlson, Shapiro, Vivek Ramaswamy and Steve Bannon <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/maga-infighting-erupts-at-day-one-of-turning-point-usa-conference-00699665?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=df9635b8-7d6f-4c86-9d5f-4c7def2c3d10" target="_blank">sparring over Fuentes</a> and whether he had a place in the party this weekend at Turning Point’s AmericaFest in Phoenix.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Conway, a conservative lawyer and vocal critic of President Donald Trump, filed paperwork on Monday to run as a Democrat for the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/01/rep-jerry-nadler-to-retire-00539183" target="_blank">seat Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) is vacating</a>.</p> 
<p>News of Conway entering the race began surfacing last month, especially after Conway <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/politics/george-conway-congressional-run.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2U8.HbBc.yonWJCofFbrJ&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank">confirmed he had hired a Democratic pollster</a> to weigh his chances.</p> 
<p>Conway was previously married to Kellyanne Conway, who helped manage Trump’s 2016 presidential bid and then served in the White House during Trump’s first term.</p> 
<p>Though George Conway was also offered a position with the administration during Trump’s first term, he declined. The relationship between the president and Conway turned contentious, with Conway often criticizing Trump and the president in turn commenting on the Conways' marriage.</p> 
<p>The feud ultimately culminated in <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108335293671845888?s=20" target="_blank">Trump calling Conway</a> a “stone cold LOSER &amp; husband from hell” and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yufAbIeNk0Y" target="_blank">Conway calling Trump a “fascist.”</a> Conway went on to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/" target="_blank">pen an essay</a> that called Trump “unfit for office.”</p> 
<p>The lawyer eventually co-founded The Lincoln Project, a PAC of former Republicans with a self-described purpose of defeating Trump, and has continued to criticize the president.</p> 
<p>Shortly after Conway filed to run, Councilmember Erik Bottcher <a href="https://x.com/ebottcher/status/2003154217058672737?s=20" target="_blank">announced he is ending his campaign</a> for House of Representatives, choosing instead to run for New York State Senate. </p> 
<p>But Conway will still join an increasingly crowded primary race for Nadler’s seat. At least nine hopefuls — including Jack Schlossberg, the only grandson of John F. Kennedy — have filed to run for the position since <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51541" data-person-id="51541">Nadler</a> announced in September he would not seek reelection.</p> 
<p>March for Our Lives organizer Cameron Kasky, Assemblymen Alex Bores and Micah Lasher have also filed to run for the Manhattan-based seat. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CBS News abruptly pulled a “60 Minutes” investigation featuring Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador’s CECOT prison on Sunday, sparking swift backlash within the newsroom, including from the story’s veteran correspondent.</p> 
<p>The canceled segment, yanked at the behest of newly appointed editor in chief Bari Weiss, focused on the notorious El Salvador prison that President Donald Trump has deported immigrants to despite <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/el-salvador/" target="_blank">reports of human rights violations within the prison</a>. Several men now released from the prison were featured in the segment describing the conditions they endured within CECOT.</p> 
<p>But Weiss nixed the segment just hours before it was set to air after calling for multiple additions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/21/business/60-minutes-trump-bari-weiss.html" target="_blank">according to The New York Times</a>, including an interview with top Trump adviser Stephen Miller or another top official in the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>CBS <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/2002854497685582309?s=20" target="_blank">said in a statement</a> that the segment will air at a later date, and Weiss defended the decision to hold the segment in a statement to POLITICO.</p> 
<p>“My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be,” Weiss said. “Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”</p> 
<p>But Sharyn Alfonsi, the veteran correspondent on the story, condemned Weiss’ decision.</p> 
<p><a href="https://x.com/grynbaum/status/2002943084322287815?s=20" target="_blank">In an email</a> obtained by The New York Times and later shared on social media by Times reporter Michael M. Grynbaum, Alfonsi told her CBS colleagues that reporters on the segment had requested comment from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. She added that the segment had also already undergone a rigorous review and fact-checking process.</p> 
<p>To pull the story so close to airtime, Alfonsi said, is “not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”</p> 
<p>“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote. “Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.”</p> 
<p>She continued, “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a 'kill switch' for any reporting they find convenient.”</p> 
<p>Alfonsi added that if CBS’ new standard for airing a segment requires government interviews, then the government “effectively gains control over the '60 Minutes' broadcast.”</p> 
<p>“We have been promoting this story on social media for days. Our viewers are expecting it,” Alfonsi wrote. “When it airs without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of ‘Gold Standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet.”</p> 
<p>During an editorial call on Monday, Weiss spoke of "trust" between members of the newsroom and the public. </p> 
<p>"The only newsroom I'm interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect, and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. Anything else is absolutely unacceptable," Weiss said on the call<b>. </b>Multiple news outlets reported on the call and CBS confirmed Weiss' comments to staff to POLITICO. </p> 
<p>She also reiterated that she held "Inside CECOT" because "it was not ready."</p> 
<p>"While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball — the Times and other outlets have previously done similar work," said Weiss. "The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is '60 Minutes.' We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera."</p> 
<p>The viewers, Weiss added "come first." </p> 
<p>"That's my north star and I hope it's yours, too," she said. </p> 
<p>The cancellation of “Inside CECOT” is the latest in a string of controversial moves made by the media giant this year.</p> 
<p>In July, CBS <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/02/cbs-paramount-donald-trump-settlement-00436989" target="_blank">announced a $16 million settlement with Trump</a>, who sued the company as a private citizen following his own appearance on “60 Minutes.” It was after that settlement that the Trump administration approved Paramount Skydance’s acquisition of CBS.</p> 
<p>Weiss, founder of The Free Press, was appointed as editor in chief by Paramount owner David Ellison in October to overhaul the newsroom.</p> 
<p>Trump has continued to express <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115730908630818072" target="_blank">his displeasure with CBS</a>, but that hasn’t stopped Ellison from courting the administration’s favor as he seeks to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Progressives are pushing Medicare for All in some of the Democratic Party's most competitive Senate primaries next year, threatening the unity the party has found on attacking Republicans over expiring Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>In Maine, Graham Platner said he’s making Medicare for All a “core part” of his platform in his race against Gov. Janet Mills, the establishment pick who’s <a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/11/25/mainers-consider-forgoing-health-insurance-due-to-spiking-costs/" target="_blank">called for a universal health care program</a>. In Illinois, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and Rep. Robin Kelly are both championing the concept — and calling out rival Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi for not fully embracing it.</p> 
<p>In Minnesota, Medicare for All has emerged as a key distinction between progressive Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and moderate Rep. Angie Craig, who supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act rather than Medicare for All. Flanagan said she “absolutely” expects the policy to define the primary because “it doesn’t matter if I’m in the urban core, the suburbs or greater Minnesota — when I say I’m a supporter of Medicare for All, the room erupts.”</p> 
<p>And it’s become a flashpoint in Michigan, where physician Abdul El-Sayed, who wrote a book called "Medicare for All: A Citizen’s Guide," is using his signature issue to draw a contrast with Rep. Haley Stevens and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who favor other approaches.</p> 
<p>Medicare for All — government-funded health coverage for every American — is “where we need to point to,” El-Sayed said in an interview. “And I think you can galvanize a winning coalition around this issue.”</p> 
<p>But some more moderate Democrats worry that progressives' renewed push for Medicare for All would undermine the party’s recent united front in fighting for an extension of the Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year, leading to a significant spike in insurance costs for millions of Americans. Their effort initially failed in the Senate, but with the help of four vulnerable Republicans who crossed party lines this week, Democrats have now secured a House vote on an extension in January.</p> 
<p>"We have a singular message, which is: ‘Don’t let these tax credits go.’ We have Republicans on the ropes,” said a national Democratic strategist who works on Senate races and was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “I don’t think introducing ‘we need MFA’ is the right strategy right now. I think it would be unhelpful."</p> 
<p>Several Democratic consultants pointed to recent public polling showing Americans like having individual insurance coverage, despite being dissatisfied with health care companies. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/poll-are-satisfied-health-insurance-quarter-report-denials-delays-rcna248908" target="_blank">An NBC News poll</a> found 82 percent of Americans were satisfied with their plans, both private and government-sponsored. Based on that data, these consultants said allowing Americans to buy into a government-offered plan, known as a “public option,” is more politically palatable.</p> 
<p>Centrists have long dismissed Medicare for All as both a policy pipe dream and political albatross for their party — a rallying cry for the left that serves as catnip for Republican ad-makers looking to broad brush Democrats as socialists. They argue that surveys often fail to present voters with the full picture of how Medicare for All would work, and therefore fail to capture its electoral toxicity.</p> 
<p>“What we need to accept is there’s a deeply held skepticism among Americans about going zero to 60 that’s entirely government run, even though they don’t love the current system,” said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist and president of the Searchlight Institute. “In isolation, this thing does okay. But it’s not how it plays out in real life, and the totality will crush us.”</p> 
<p>The once-fringe policy that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) mainstreamed during his presidential campaigns has become a rallying cry for his favored candidates and other progressives across battleground primaries, as Democrats work to make health care costs central to next year’s midterms and as the party base clamors for fighters willing to disrupt the status quo. The push for Medicare for All, which receded during the more moderate Biden era, comes as Democrats have otherwise been unified on their health care messaging, forcing Republicans onto defense over their refusal to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.</p> 
<p>“Do I think every single swing-seat candidate is going to come out for Medicare for All? No,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist and board member for the nonprofit Care in Action. “But if you want to signal that you’re unafraid and bold right now, and you want to say you’re not beholden to the status quo, it’s a perfect position for that.”</p> 
<p>Progressives are <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/11/medicare-for-all-is-popular-even-when-put-up-against-attacks" target="_blank">emboldened by partisan</a> and <a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_haeOEK5.pdf" target="_blank">independent polling</a> that shows most Democrats and a majority of independents support Medicare for All. A recent survey commissioned by Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s (D-Wash.) leadership PAC and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/pramila-jayapal-pushes-medicare-for-all-polling-00696301" target="_blank">first reported by POLITICO</a> showed 90 percent of Democrats back Medicare for All and found most independents and one in five Republicans back a “government-provided system.”</p> 
<p>Jayapal, the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, plans to push her colleagues to start promoting Medicare for All again in the new year. She predicted in an interview that support for the system will be a “defining factor” in the party’s primaries next year and an electoral winner in battleground House seats.</p> 
<p>But proponents of Medicare for All argue that a government-provided system would lessen the pinch of rising health care costs. They say pushing to extend the ACA subsidies and promoting Medicare for All as an end goal are not mutually exclusive. And they point to several 2018 candidates who won tough seats while supporting the measure, including former Rep. Katie Porter in California to retiring Rep. Jared Golden of Maine.</p> 
<p>“You can know that there are short-term stopgaps that must be taken to protect working people while also thinking that long term, we need a better system,” said Platner, who is vying against Mills to unseat GOP Sen. Susan Collins in Maine.</p> 
<p>Platner has been extolling Medicare for All from the start of his campaign and said it gets the “most raucous” response at his events across Maine, where a recent <a href="https://hs-21701012.f.hubspotstarter.net/hubfs/21701012/67th%20Omnibus%20Poll%20December%202025.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_qWyGL4keanJ5LSdiKL6c5WZV-1bzCKylYwKxtbhhKyeZjebUL8XLBb0fyCN-GbIYvmJH9vOeAAN3J59WkcFJnVG8viQ&amp;_hsmi=393840029&amp;utm_content=393840029&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">Pan Atlantic Research poll</a> found 63 percent support for the system (and Platner trailing Mills by 10 points).</p> 
<p>He argued in an interview that Mills isn’t as steadfast in her support for the concept because she “doesn’t talk about it all that often” and uses “vague language” when she does. Mills has said “it is time” for universal health care and that she’s “committed to finding a way to get there” if elected. Her campaign echoed that sentiment in response to a request for comment for this story, and cited her efforts to expand Mainers access to Medicaid.</p> 
<p>In Minnesota, Flanagan said embracing Medicare for All has been a “journey” during her Senate campaign, as she heard from Minnesotans that the “cost of health care is the thing that comes over and over and over again.” Of Craig’s support for a public option, Flanagan said voters don’t want a nominee who “nibbles around the edges” instead of being “bold and audacious.”</p> 
<p>Craig calls the public option a “big, bold reform,” but emphasizes that it’s a policy “we could actually accomplish in this country in a fairly short time period,” she said in a <a href="https://x.com/angiecraigmn/status/2001393940252000258?s=46" target="_blank">video this week</a>.</p> 
<p>In Illinois, Stratton and Kelly, two of the three leading Democrats vying to replace retiring Sen. Dick Durbin, are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvlTjIoo8n8" target="_blank">jockeying for position</a> as Medicare for All’s biggest champion in the race while their campaigns knock Krishnamoorthi for couching his support for the system. Krishnamoorthi said in a statement that while it’s “a noble goal, and I’m fighting to get us to universal coverage” his focus is on extending the ACA subsidies and reversing Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid.</p> 
<p>And in Michigan, El-Sayed has slammed McMorrow’s call for universal health care with a public option as “incoherent” and ill-informed as the two compete for the same slice of progressive voters. McMorrow has <a href="https://x.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/1978943351350075534?s=20" target="_blank">knocked the idea</a> of a single-payer system run by President Donald Trump and his controversial health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And she’s promoted a public option so people who like their private insurance can keep it. Stevens’ campaign says she supports strengthening Obamacare, including through a public option, without endorsing Medicare for All.</p> 
<p>The issue is also becoming a flash point in Democratic primaries for some of the most competitive House seats in the country, driven in part by Sanders-backed candidates running from California’s Central Valley to Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley.</p> 
<p>“There’s immense hostility and anger toward the way the insurance industry functions, doubled up with health care itself being one of the biggest affordability issues,” said Mark Longabaugh, a progressive strategist who worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid. “Progressives are smart to push the case.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHOENIX — After three straight days of MAGA infighting here at Turning Point’s AmericaFest, top Republicans — including Vice President JD Vance — tried to find agreement on Sunday afternoon, shifting their focus to countering the opposition.</p> 
<p>“President Trump did not build the greatest coalition in politics by running his supporters through endless, self-defeating purity tests,” Vance told the crowd to loud applause, adding later: “We have far more important work to do than canceling each other."</p> 
<p>In his speech, Vance ripped into “far left” Democrats, casting their policies as toxic to Americans and blaming them for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-killing-trump-leadership-void-00559167" target="_blank">Charlie Kirk's September killing</a>, which has loomed large over the gathering. He touted the Trump administration’s policies on immigration, vaccines and transgender issues, while calling for the crowd to engage ahead of next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>“If you miss Charlie Kirk, do you promise to fight what he died for? Do you promise to take the country back from the people who took his life?” Vance asked the crowd.</p> 
<p>His speech at the Phoenix Convention Center is the culmination of a weekend-long festival for 30,000 of President Donald Trump’s most ardent supporters. But until Sunday, much of the weekend was clouded by an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/maga-infighting-erupts-at-day-one-of-turning-point-usa-conference-00699665?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=df9635b8-7d6f-4c86-9d5f-4c7def2c3d10" target="_blank">intra-party schism</a> that kicked off during night one on Thursday, when conservative commentator Ben Shapiro ripped into a number of fellow MAGA-verse influencers, especially Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens and Steve Bannon.</p> 
<p>“The conservative movement is in serious danger,” Shapiro said, especially from some “charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty.”</p> 
<p>Those themes carried through on Friday and Saturday, with presidential-hopeful turned Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy casting the moment as “a time for choosing in the conservative movement.”</p> 
<p>Like Shapiro, Ramasawamy focused significant time on Carlson and his interview with far-right influencer and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, <a href="https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/2002184151680872533?s=20" target="_blank">listing some of his most inflammatory remarks</a> and saying they “have no place in this movement.”</p> 
<p>Then, Bannon hit the stage and reversed course, comparing Shapiro to a “a cancer, and that cancer spreads.”</p> 
<p>“Ben Shapiro is the farthest thing from MAGA,” Bannon told the crowd.</p> 
<p>The sold-out annual meeting is the group’s first since founder Charlie Kirk was gunned down in September. It has featured a broad array of figures from within the conservative movement, including top commentators, elected officials, candidates and religious leaders, culminating with Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday.</p> 
<p>Johnson called the weekend an “epic and faithful battle that truly will determine the future of our great republic” while stressing the importance of keeping control of the House ahead of next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>Vance also spent much of his speech talking about the midterms, bashing Democratic Senate candidates Graham Platner of Maine and Jasmine Crockett of Texas, who are both running in competitive primaries.</p> 
<p>“We are gonna kick their ass next November,” Vance said of Democrats as the crowd immediately burst into “USA” chants. Outside of Johnson and Vance, a number of other speakers on Sunday sought to bridge the divisions that emerged in the prior days.</p> 
<p>"I choose to build a movement, be part of a movement, that stands on principle, on strength, that loves the people in the movement, even sometimes when they piss you off,” said Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who is running for governor. "You can't form a winning unit if you can't stay focused on the mission at hand.”</p> 
<p>Donald Trump Jr. also sought to shift the focus to Democrats.</p> 
<p>“The real enemy? It’s not Steve Bannon or Tucker Carlson or Ben Shapiro, it’s the radical left that murdered Charlie and celebrated it on a daily basis,” Trump Jr. told the crowd.</p> 
<p>The political beliefs of alleged Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson, who is facing multiple charges including aggravated murder, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/09/17/how-charlie-kirks-killer-poisoned-everyone-with-meme-slop-00569200" target="_blank">aren’t easily defined</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration, initially wary over the Justice Department’s release of Jeffrey Epstein documents, pounced on go-to villain Bill Clinton’s appearance in Friday’s trove of pictures, emails and interviews.</p> 
<p>“I wonder why the Biden DOJ refused to release the files…,” DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin posted from <a href="https://x.com/ChadGilmartinCA/status/2002136880629043489?s=20" target="_blank"><u>his personal X account</u></a>, alongside one partially-redacted photo of Clinton <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%202/EFTA00003170.pdf" target="_blank"><u>in a pool with an unidentified woman</u></a>. Another swimming pool photo Gilmartin posted shows Clinton with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime co-conspirator who was convicted of sex trafficking charges in 2021.</p> 
<p>Trump and the DOJ also resisted releasing the files until Congress passed a bill to do so. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/trump-signs-epstein-files-bill-00658418" target="_blank"><u>Trump signed the bill last month</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Clinton has long been linked with Epstein, contributing to his status as MAGA’s favored boogeyman. Some high-profile members of the movement cited him in pushing for the release of the files, and continued that message after the DOJ made public a trove of documents from the government’s investigation into Epstein.</p> 
<p>“Slick Willy! @BillClinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know…” White House Communications Director Steven Cheung <a href="https://x.com/stevencheung47/status/2002135433933959178?s=12" target="_blank"><u>posted to X</u></a>.</p> 
<p>“Here is Bill Clinton in a hot tub next to someone whose identity has been redacted. Per the Epstein Files Transparency Act, DOJ was specifically instructed only to redact the faces of victims and/or minors. Time for the media to start asking real questions,” White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson <a href="https://x.com/abigailmarone/status/2002136727029493885?s=20" target="_blank"><u>posted to her personal X account</u></a>.</p> 
<p>The act also allowed the DOJ to redact material related to active investigations.</p> 
<p>It’s unclear when the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%202/EFTA00003168.pdf" target="_blank"><u>previously unreleased photo</u></a> was taken and where the pool is located.</p> 
<p>Clinton appears in photos <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%202/EFTA00003177.pdf" target="_blank"><u>posing with Epstein in coordinating shirts</u></a>, interacting with a dancer, sitting with a redacted woman on his lap on what looks like an airplane and with someone who appears to be the late pop icon Michael Jackson. The music legend faced his own child sex abuse allegations as early as 1993, though he was never convicted of any crimes.</p> 
<p>The former president is also seen at a dinner sitting next to rock star Mick Jagger, alongside Maxwell and Epstein.</p> 
<p>Epstein faced state and federal charges over two decades related to the sexual abuse and trafficking of dozens of underage girls as young as 14. He pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges in 2008, one of which was for soliciting prostitution from someone under 18. He was awaiting trial on federal child trafficking charges when he died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019. His connections to the wealthy and powerful, and efforts to keep information related to him from becoming public, has become part of the national political narrative – intensifying bipartisan sniping and deepening fractures in Trump’s base.</p> 
<p>The files were heavily redacted. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/19/epstein-documents-release-friday-deadline-00699935?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank"><u>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche </u></a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/19/epstein-investigation-files-released-00700666" target="_blank"><u>said earlier Friday</u></a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/19/epstein-documents-release-friday-deadline-00699935?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank"><u> that the first dissemination would be partial, with as many as hundreds of thousands of more documents </u></a>to follow in the coming weeks.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Clinton said the Friday afternoon timing of the document release is “about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”</p> 
<p>“So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton,” Angel Ureña, deputy chief of staff for Clinton, posted in a <a href="https://x.com/angelurena/status/2002159039183269993?s=46&amp;t=bc4OjMQq3SFcud7QML4uPw" target="_blank"><u>statement</u></a> on X. “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”</p> 
<p>Clinton and Epstein have been linked since the early 1990s, having run in the same social circles. They have been photographed together several times. Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane in the early 2000s, taking trips to Europe, Asia and Africa. Ureña <a href="https://x.com/angelurena/status/1148357927625023490" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> those trips included stops for work connected to the Clinton Foundation.</p> 
<p>The former president has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein, and said he was not aware of Epstein’s crimes, something a Clinton spokesperson reiterated in a <a href="https://x.com/angelurena/status/1148357927625023490" target="_blank"><u>social media post six years ago</u></a>.</p> 
<p>Democrats on the House Oversight Committee <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/politics/epstein-photos-trump-clinton-bannon" target="_blank"><u>this month</u></a> released additional photos from Epstein’s estate that feature Clinton.</p> 
<p>Trump has long suggested that Clinton repeatedly visited Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the location of alleged sex trafficking and abuse where the financier hosted high-profile friends. But White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in a Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/16/susie-wiles-trump-clinton-epstein-interview-00692570" target="_blank"><u>interview</u></a> published this week that Trump was “wrong” to tie Clinton to Epstein’s criminal activity.</p> 
<p>Trump and Epstein were longtime friends before Trump said they had a falling out several years ago. The president has denied wrongdoing in relation to the Epstein allegations, and no evidence has suggested that he took part in Epstein’s trafficking operation.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHOENIX — Members of the MAGA faithful gathered here Thursday to kick off Turning Point USA’s America Fest, the largest meeting for the organization since its founder, Charlie Kirk, was shot to death on a Utah college campus in September.</p> 
<p>Despite that somber backdrop, the event quickly devolved into a spectacle of MAGA infighting.</p> 
<p>Ben Shapiro, the first speaker after widow Erika Kirk, ripped into those who would take the same stage in the coming hours and days. He called out conservative commentators, blasting Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Steve Bannon as “frauds and grifters.”</p> 
<p>“The conservative movement is in serious danger,” Shapiro said, arguing the danger is not just on the left, but “from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty.”</p> 
<p>He called Bannon “a PR flack for Jeffrey Epstein” ahead of the imminent release of files related to the late convicted sex offender, while praising President Donald Trump and his administration's handling of the issue. Trump pushed to stop Republicans in Congress from voting to release the files, though he signed the legislation once it was passed. Both Bannon and Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/12/trump-clinton-gates-included-in-epstein-photo-trove-00688628" target="_blank">appear in photos with Epstein that were released by House Democrats</a>.</p> 
<p>Shapiro particularly focused on Carlson — both for elevating Owens’ <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/piers-morgan-confronts-candace-owens-over-charlie-kirk-conspiracy-theories-tense-interview" target="_blank">conspiracy theories about Kirk's murder</a> and for his recent interview with far-right influencer Nick Fuentes, a Holocaust denier who has repeatedly pushed antisemitic tropes. Carlson, a former Fox News host, now hosts his show on X and routinely garners millions of views.</p> 
<p>“The people who refused to condemn Candace’s truly vicious attacks — and some of them are speaking here tonight — are guilty of cowardice,” Shapiro said, adding later: “If you host a Hitler apologist, Nazi-loving, anti-American piece of refuse like Nick Fuentes … you ought to own it.”</p> 
<p>Both the Fuentes interview and Owens’ conspiracies have embroiled the party in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Shapiro called on the Heritage Foundation, the powerful conservative think tank whose president defended the interview, to change its tune about Carlson’s elevation of Fuentes.</p> 
<p>Carlson responded with heat of his own from the stage Thursday.</p> 
<p>“That guy is pompous,” Carlson said, saying he “laughed” while watching clips of Shapiro's speech backstage. “Calls to deplatform at a Charlie Kirk event? That’s hilarious.”</p> 
<p>Carlson went on to rail against cancel culture, and promised the crowd that he was not antisemitic. “Antisemitism is not just naughty, it’s immoral,” he said.</p> 
<p>Erika Kirk addressed the MAGA movement’s fractures, while casting her late husband as a rare unifier and pleading with the crowd to embrace disagreement. “You won’t agree with everyone on this stage this weekend,” she said. “And that's okay. Welcome to America.”</p> 
<p>The event wasn’t entirely heated. Actor Russell Brand — who spoke between Shapiro and Carlson — focused on Christianity, while sprinkling attacks on vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry into his remarks. And earlier in the day, attendees danced to upbeat music, repeatedly chanted “USA” and celebrated Trump’s return to the White House at the Phoenix Convention Center, which is plastered with imagery of Charlie Kirk. More than 30,000 people gathered for the event.</p> 
<p>Kirk’s influence on young people was particularly evident, with thousands of high school and college attendees, some of whom posed for photos in front of a tent that resembled the one Kirk was speaking in front of when he was shot during “The American Comeback Tour.”</p> 
<p>Erika Kirk — who now serves as Turning Point’s CEO — said 80 percent of attendees had never been to America Fest before, and one-third of them were students. More than 140,000 people have submitted requests to join the organization since Kirk’s death, bringing the membership to over 1 million people across 4,000 chapters at high schools and colleges, she added.</p> 
<p>While the group has welcomed speakers from across the conservative movement, it made clear choices about which politicians to welcome to the stage, providing a glimpse into how the organization hopes to shape the future of the GOP. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and GOP Rep. Mike Collins, both candidates for Senate, and gubernatorial hopefuls Andy Biggs of Arizona and Byron Donalds of Florida, were given slots on the main stage.</p> 
<p>Erika Kirk also made a point of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/18/erika-kirk-endorses-jd-vance-president-00699610?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">promising to elevate Vice President JD Vance</a> — who will close the event on Sunday — to the White House in 2028. Vance leads early polls of the likely GOP field.</p> 
<p>“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHOENIX. Arizona — Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk has endorsed Vice President JD Vance for president, an early sign of influential support for a likely leading candidate in 2028.</p> 
<p>Kirk, who took over leadership of Turning Point after her husband, Charlie, was killed in September, announced her decision during a speech Thursday at the organization’s America Fest conference in Phoenix.</p> 
<p>Vance is scheduled to speak at the conference on Sunday.</p> 
<p>“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” Kirk said.</p> 
<p>Vance has not yet committed to running in 2028, but as vice president he is widely expected to seek the White House. TPUSA — founded by Charlie Kirk — holds major influence for the MAGA movement, particularly among young conservatives, and the early endorsement could give an early lead among the Republican hopefuls.</p> 
<p>“My attitude is the American people elected me to be vice president,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/29/jd-vance-marco-rubio-2028-00627286" target="_blank">Vance told the New York Post in October</a>. “I’m going to work as hard as I can to make the president successful over the next three years and three months, and if we get to a point where something else is in the offer, let’s handle it then.”</p> 
<p>Kirk made the endorsement in front of a crowd of thousands of people, many of whom are ardent supporters of President Donald Trump — and they responded with resounding applause.</p> 
<p>Vance and Charlie Kirk were particularly close before Kirk's death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RALEIGH, N.C. — Four-term <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-8e99e89aa07942898b7a1ccc8de415d7" target="_blank">North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt,</a> a towering figure in North Carolina politics in the late 20th century who helped the Democratic Party focus nationally upon public education reform, died Thursday at the age of 88, his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-election-council-appeals-courts-5e73d072749c09276c10d25b753f42ab" target="_blank">daughter Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt</a> announced.</p> 
<p>Hunt, whose career provided a prototype for the modern “education governor,” served an unprecedented 16 years as governor as the state received the rewards and stings of shifting from textiles and tobacco to a high-tech economy.</p> 
<p>Rachel Hunt’s office said that her father died peacefully Thursday at his Wilson County home.</p> 
<p>“He devoted his life to serving the people of North Carolina, guided by a belief that public service should expand opportunity, strengthen communities, and always put people first,” Rachel Hunt said in a news release that also referenced “my beloved daddy and hero.”</p> 
<p>Considered a business-oriented progressive, Hunt was a giant in state government and influential in the national education reform movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He was first elected governor in 1976 and, after a constitutional change, became the first North Carolina governor elected to successive four-year terms.</p> 
<p>Following an epic U.S. Senate campaign loss to Republican icon Jesse Helms in 1984, Hunt’s political career resumed eight years later with a third term at the Executive Mansion, followed by reelection in 1996.</p> 
<p>Hunt remained active in Democratic politics after leaving office in 2001, particularly as he watched protégés such as former Gov. Roy Cooper and the late U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan achieve higher office. He <a href="https://apnews.com/5938587844b74623ac21a1fd9bdc7846" target="_blank">campaigned for President Barack Obama</a> in 2012 and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Cooper in 2016.</p> 
<p>“I can think of no one who shaped North Carolina’s recent successes as much as Governor Jim Hunt,” current Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said Thursday. And Cooper called Hunt the “greatest Governor in North Carolina history.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-8e99e89aa07942898b7a1ccc8de415d7" target="_blank">Even entering his 80s</a>, Hunt urged Republicans in charge of the legislature to fund “big things” for public education, rather than pass more income tax cuts.</p> 
<p>“I’m proud of what we’ve done together,” Hunt said in a May 2017 interview. “But I’m far from satisfied about where we are and determined to keep doing my little bit, I guess, to help us keep changing things and improving things in North Carolina. And I know you do it mainly through education.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Relentless on building up public schools</h5> 
<p>Hunt concentrated relentlessly on public schools, talking about the connection between education achievement and competing in the world economy. In the 1970s, while lieutenant governor, he worked with <a href="https://apnews.com/3cc611af23ed4fbe9b01cb54ec4807d0" target="_blank">Republican Gov. Jim Holshouser</a> to make North Carolina the first state with full-day kindergarten.</p> 
<p>In the 1980s, he helped create the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and pressed for standardized testing for public school students nationwide so that states could compare themselves.</p> 
<p>Returning as governor in the 1990s, he championed the Smart Start early childhood initiative, viewed as a national model to prepare children for school, and higher teacher pay. And after the end of his career in office, the Durham-based Hunt Institute trained up and coming political stars nationwide about public education policy.</p> 
<p>“If there is one person that is responsible for remaking and reforming education in the nation, particularly in the Southeast and starting with North Carolina, it is Jim Hunt,” former Democratic Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes said in a 2009 interview. “We will feel the effect of Jim Hunt’s leadership for generations to come.”</p> 
<p>Hunt was an unabashed lobbyist for his programs and initiatives, often making late-night phone calls to lawmakers to persuade them. If that failed, he would enlist key constituents in a legislator’s district to bombard with them calls all weekend.</p> 
<p>“He really had a way of pushing you to do things you never thought you could do,” said Gary Pearce, a longtime Hunt staffer and later biographer. “He made you feel like that you were genuinely making the world a better place.”</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">Quick rise in North Carolina politics</h5> 
<p>James Baxter Hunt Jr. was born May 16, 1937, in Greensboro, North Carolina. He grew up on the family’s tobacco and dairy farm in Wilson County. After law school graduation, Hunt, his wife, Carolyn, and their young children lived in Nepal for two years while working for the Ford Foundation.</p> 
<p>Hunt rose quickly in Democratic politics, serving as president of the state’s Young Democrats in 1968 and getting elected lieutenant governor four years later.</p> 
<p>In a controversial move during his first term as governor, Hunt commuted the sentences of nine Black men and one white woman convicted of the 1971 firebombing of a Wilmington grocery store during days of violence that included the shooting of a Black teenager by police. Key witnesses in the case had recanted their testimony. Full pardons for the “Wilmington 10” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/raleigh-north-carolina-wilmington-racial-injustice-bombings-516516a170a24535a2a22abe6c8452e0" target="_blank">didn’t come until 2012.</a></p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">After loss to Helms, a rebirth and return to governor</h5> 
<p>His second four-year term closed with his political battle with Helms, the conservative firebrand known as “Senator No” for his opposition to civil rights, gay rights, abortion and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Hunt lost as Helms’ campaign blistered him with ads portraying Hunt as a flip-flopper on the issues.</p> 
<p>A defeated Hunt returned to practicing law but remained in public life. His comeback to state politics in the early 1990s helped delay a growing Republican tide in North Carolina politics.</p> 
<p>Even GOP leaders begrudgingly were impressed with Hunt’s ability to tack with changing political winds. In the mid-1990s, he called a special legislative session to get tough on crime and proposed tax cuts larger than what Republicans initially offered.</p> 
<p>Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a former state House speaker in the 2010s, called Hunt on Thursday “one of the most consequential public servants in North Carolina’s history.”</p> 
<p>Rachel Hunt served in the legislature and was elected lieutenant governor in 2024. Jim Hunt was on hand at the Legislative Building in early 2025 when she took as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-legislature-opening-new-speaker-9008424dd87d2aeea84a7ef606e2cf37" target="_blank">a duty of lieutenant governor</a> the gavel as Senate president, following in her father’s footsteps 52 years later.</p> 
<p>Memorial information for Hunt will be announced later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic National Committee is refusing to release its autopsy of the party’s major 2024 losses it announced on Wednesday, breaking Chair Ken Martin’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/01/ken-martin-elected-dnc-party-chair-00201938" target="_blank"><u>public pledge to do so</u></a>. The decision underscores the party’s challenges in grappling with its electoral setbacks as it heads into <a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/democrats-2026-midterm-flips-redistricting-data/" target="_blank"><u>what is expected to be a stronger midterm year.</u></a></p> 
<p>The DNC’s completed post-election review of the party’s melodramatic and botched campaign cycle is based on hundreds of interviews with operatives in all 50 states. During that process, some Democrats raised concerns about releasing the findings, according to a DNC official granted anonymity to describe the sensitive process.</p> 
<p>The DNC wanted to avoid another public debate over how the party lost the White House to Donald Trump, and instead, turn its focus on its recent successes, according to this official. Democrats have overperformed in special elections across the country this year, and won handily in New Jersey and Virginia last month. The committee <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/dnc-briefs-top-democrats-on-audit-of-2024-white-house-loss-00597998" target="_blank"><u>previewed some initial findings</u></a> from the autopsy to top donors and other Democratic stakeholders in October.</p> 
<p>Former President Joe Biden's decision to run for reelection, despite his advanced age — and his disastrous debate performance — were not mentioned in the some excerpts of the report's findings, which were shared with POLITICO. Democrats are still divided over what contributed to Kamala Harris' loss.</p> 
<p>In a statement, Martin said the committee had “completed a comprehensive review of what happened in 2024” and they are “putting our learnings into motion,” noting the party’s off-year victories.</p> 
<p>“In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what’s important, and that’s learning from the past and winning the future,” Martin continued. “Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”</p> 
<p>The decision marks an about-face for a coalition that’s at odds over what went wrong last year, and still registering <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/poll-shock-democrats-congressional-approval-sinks-all-time-low" target="_blank"><u>record-low</u></a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/11/poll-democrats-jobs-economy-00222988" target="_blank"><u>approval</u></a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/democratic-party-poll-voter-confidence-july-2025-9db38021?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdN6PgWJ2ORMInFa8bmZ2KaICRsx9G5_TtBfjHFNYA41xiiN4uejhvLgsAwqAw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69436602&amp;gaa_sig=rtuJCf67rnRXfdBxvgWYp8MJ0OjsVHhKD2e3MpeNUn4OVZdGkIrws8_jK3lPSy1JPgeFwp3Ian4O3rZFCXmNXw%3D%3D" target="_blank"><u>ratings</u></a> even among its own voters. Several outside groups, from <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/204271/why-democrats-lost-2024-election-trump-way-to-win-report" target="_blank"><u>the progressive Way to Win</u></a> to the <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/27/2025/democrats-urged-to-jettison-progressive-rhetoric-favored-by-highly-educated-and-affluent" target="_blank"><u>center-left Welcome nonprofit</u></a>, released their own in-depth audits of the party’s missteps with differing diagnoses for how to fix its problems. Just last week, some DNC members <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/13/dnc-democratic-national-committee-hope-00689938" target="_blank"><u>called on the committee</u></a> to provide more answers.</p> 
<p>The DNC official described some examples of the report’s findings, including the party’s organizing strategies, necessary technological upgrades and its youth voter problem — though the details shared with POLITICO were sparse and incomplete. Excerpts from the review broadly described Democrats as defensive on immigration and public safety — issues that generally favor Republicans — but didn’t name-check a campaign, candidate or entity for its role in this posture, at least not publicly.</p> 
<p>On the party’s organizing efforts, the DNC’s review urged campaigns to incentivize engaging conversations with voters over just the number of doors knocked and phones called. It called for investing more into relational organizing and year-round field infrastructure, efforts Martin championed during his chair’s race last year. Of the party’s data infrastructure, the DNC’s report issued warnings that it was out-of-date and overwhelmed at key moments during the campaign and called for it to be modernized.</p> 
<p>It described the party’s much-reported losses among young voters, citing Republicans’ advantages in communicating through the influencer ecosystem and pressing Democrats to do engage with non-traditional media sources. Back in February, Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/16/democrats-losing-trump-doge-information-battle-00204522" target="_blank"><u>conceded the GOP was “running circles” around them online</u></a>, but in describing its findings, the DNC doesn’t go much further in clarifying its own public recommendations.</p> 
<p>This fall, the DNC <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/dnc-briefs-top-democrats-on-audit-of-2024-white-house-loss-00597998" target="_blank"><u>held briefings with donors and other Democratic stakeholders</u></a> on its initial findings. At the time, one Democrat who attended an October donor event confirmed that Biden’s initial decision to run in spite of his advanced age was not mentioned by DNC officials as a part of the review. It’s not clear whether his decision to run for reelection is discussed in the private review.</p> 
<p>Biden’s age was not mentioned in the excerpts of the review shared with POLITICO on Thursday, nor was it raised <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/08/dnc-briefs-top-democrats-on-audit-of-2024-white-house-loss-00597998" target="_blank"><u>in other briefings on the report’s initial findings</u></a>. Most Democrats cite the last-minute candidate switch as a core reason for the party’s sweeping losses.</p> 
<p>Martin’s decision to withhold the report doubles back on a pledge he made just hours after he was elected to be the DNC’s chair in February. In comments to reporters, Martin committed to the public release of the 2024 report.</p> 
<p>At the time, he also questioned why the DNC hadn’t released its 2016 autopsy, when he questioned, “what happened with that … was there any utility in doing that?”</p> 
<p>“Of course it will be released,” Martin said in February, referring to a future review on the 2024 election. “There has to be some lessons that we glean on that so we can operationalize it, not just here in DC, but through all of the 57 state parties, and, of course, the county parties, so people have a sense of what we need to do.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wants Medicare for All back in the health care debate.</p> 
<p>The former Congressional Progressive Caucus chair plans to present polling to her House Democratic colleagues next month as she argues for the electoral merits of Medicare for All — even in battleground districts the party must win to flip the House next fall. The research, paid for by Jayapal’s leadership PAC and shared first with POLITICO, found one in five Republicans support a “government-provided system,” as do most independents. Democrats back Medicare for All by 90 percent.</p> 
<p>Two-thirds of voters said the federal government does “too little” to help people afford health care. Just 18 percent said the government does “too much.”</p> 
<p>Jayapal’s Medicare for All push comes as Democrats have been largely unified on their health care messaging, pushing Republicans on the back foot about extending expiring Obamacare subsidies. Injecting Medicare for All back into the debate could also reopen a long-running intraparty fight that moderate Democrats aren’t keen to have.</p> 
<p>In an interview, Jayapal described swing district voters’ openness to Medicare for All and a desire for “fundamental change” as a “significant shift” in recent years. She cited the rising costs of health care for making the current system less appealing to swing voters who “don't feel like they can afford health care right now” and “don't feel like they have a choice right now.”</p> 
<p>“Whatever tropes they may have had about Medicare for all, those don't really exist today in the public's mind,” Jayapal said, arguing Democrats should now “put forward a very united and universal, comprehensive vision for health care in this country.”</p> 
<p>Democrats are hoping to make health care a central midterm messaging — tying this fall’s federal government shutdown <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/17/congress/brian-fitzpatrick-joins-house-democrats-health-care-discharge-petition-00694688" target="_blank"><u>to a debate within the GOP</u></a> over extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Jayapal hopes to nudge her party into not only pushing back on President Donald Trump’s cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and the ACA, but also “be ready with a proactive vision” for voters, she said.</p> 
<p>Jayapal will undoubtedly face pushback from moderate Democrats over championing an issue that’s long divided the party. Medicare for All defined much of the ideological battle of the 2020 presidential primary, serving as the progressives’ flagship policy. After Joe Biden, who didn’t <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/biden-says-he-wouldd-veto-medicare-for-all-as-coronavirus-focuses-attention-on-health.html" target="_blank"><u>back it citing the price tag</u></a>, won the primary, the policy largely fell out of the conversation.</p> 
<p>Over the last five years, Medicare for All has remained popular among Democrats — and Jayapal argues her latest research shows that it’s increasingly intriguing to independents and Republicans, who are feeling the pinch of rising health care costs. Jayapal said she’ll pitch her polling to Republican members, too, though she declined to name them.</p> 
<p>“There’s going to be some internal resistance [to Medicare for All] but it needs to be informed by polling, and in our survey, a majority of voters are in favor of it,” said David Walker, a pollster at GQR Research who conducted the survey. “We didn’t gild the lily [in the survey], we didn’t say it’d all be free.”</p> 
<p>The poll described Medicare for All to participants as a “system [that] would still use the same doctors and hospitals as today, but take the profit motive out of health care by using a government-administered insurance system, like Medicare or Medicaid,” acknowledging “taxes will increase for many Americans,” but added, “those could be offset by not having to pay for health insurance premiums, co-pays or out-of-pocket costs.” The poll found 54 percent of voters nationally and 56 percent in battleground districts back Medicare for All.</p> 
<p>Jaypal acknowledged confusion around the meaning of Medicare for All, and suggested adding “improved” to the slogan, as a nod to Americans’ frustrations with the existing Medicare program.</p> 
<p>Jayapal said she intentionally used a polling firm that works closely with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee because “we wanted to make it clear this isn’t some fringe poll.” GQR surveyed 1,000 likely 2026 voters from Nov. 5 to Nov. 13, oversampling voters in battleground House seats. The margin of error is 3.1 percentage points.</p>]]></content:encoded>
