      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House unanimously voted 426-0 Wednesday night to claw back language in last week's government funding bill that could award some GOP senators hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for having their phone records unknowingly obtained by former special counsel Jack Smith.</p> 
<p>The language, which was quietly slipped into the shutdown-ending package last week by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, drove bipartisan outrage in the House. Even outspoken critics of Smith — including House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is leading an investigation into the Biden-era probe — supported the effort to repeal a politically toxic measure that was quickly branded as a taxpayer-funded windfall for a select few.</p> 
<p>“That policy, in my opinion — in the opinion I think of all the members of this institution — is unacceptable,” said House Administration Committee chair Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), during floor debate. “No one should be able to enrich themselves because the federal government wronged them, no elected official should be able to.”</p> 
<p>The provision would allow senators to sue the federal government for $500,000 or more if their electronic data was subpoenaed without proper notification. But there are concerns over the language’s retroactivity — which would extend protections to at least eight Republican senators whose records were obtained as part of Smith’s investigation into Donald Trump’s attempts to subvert the 2020 election results.</p> 
<p>There are no guarantees the bill to repeal the language will get a vote in the Senate.</p> 
<p>The revelations that Smith obtained lawmakers’ private data has enraged Republican senators, who argue his probe amounted to a politicization of the Justice Department. But Smith’s subpoena was narrowly tailored for data around the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, and investigators did not receive the contents of their calls.</p> 
<p>Several GOP lawmakers whose phone data was subpoenaed have distanced themselves from the provision. But it may be too late. Thune hasn’t shown any interest in bringing the bill to the Senate floor, even amid the pushback from his members over his quiet decision to include it in the funding package.</p> 
<p>Thune told reporters Wednesday that additional conversations are necessary to reach a consensus about how to change the provision.</p> 
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has indicated he intends to sue for a significant monetary reward, has <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/senate-gop-split-over-how-to-amend-the-jack-smith-phone-data-measure-00660149" target="_blank">proposed expanding who can sue</a> under the legislative language.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>House Ethics Committee establishes panel to investigate Cory Mills</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:37:01 EST</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House Ethics Committee launched a formal investigation Wednesday into myriad allegations against the embattled Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/398811" data-person-id="398811">Cory Mills</a>, with the House poised to vote on whether to censure the Florida Republican later tonight.</p> 
<p>The bipartisan panel responsible for adjudicating accusations against House members has stood up an investigative subcommittee to review various allegations against Mills. It will be responsible for evaluating whether Mills broke House rules, laws or other standards in violating campaign finance rules; engaging in sexual misconduct or dating violence; or misusing his position or House resources; among other potential charges.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Mills did not immediately return a request for comment.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/cory-millis-threats-allegations-gop-00496518" target="_blank">Outside allegations against Mills</a> are numerous. He has been accused of stolen valor, benefiting from federal contracts while in office and assaulting a onetime girlfriend in his Washington apartment. That woman has since denied being assaulted, and Mills was never charged.</p> 
<p>More recently, another ex-girlfriend <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/05/gop-rep-mills-accused-of-threatening-to-release-nude-videos-of-ex-girlfriend-00495059" target="_blank">accused Mills of threatening</a> to release explicit videos of her. Last month, a judge in Florida <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/cory-mills-restraining-order-florida-00608307" target="_blank">granted the woman a restraining order</a> against the lawmaker.</p> 
<p>The announcement from the Ethics Committee Wednesday afternoon said members will also consider whether Mills “failed to properly disclose required information on statements required to be filed with the House;” “improperly solicited and/or received gifts, including in connection with privately sponsored officially-connected travel;” or “received special favors by virtue of his position.”</p> 
<p>The panel had already been looking at some allegations against Mills, after a referral from what was then the Office of Congressional Ethics. The nonpartisan watchdog found “substantial reason to believe” Mills may have violated campaign finance rules, benefited from federal contracts while in office, or misreported his financial information.</p> 
<p>The Ethics Committee's announcement comes on the same day that Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/282851" data-person-id="282851">Nancy Mace</a> (R-S.C.) introduced a resolution to censure Mills and strip him of his committee assignments. Republican leaders are expected to attempt to refer the matter to the Ethics Committee as a way of tabling the matter on the House floor, and the disclosure of the panel's investigative steps could help provide political cover to GOP conference members who might have otherwise felt pressure to formally admonish Mills.</p> 
<p>Still, the allegations against Mills have become a growing headache for House GOP leaders. Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, asked about the restraining order against Mills last month, replied: “I have not heard or looked into any of the details of that.”</p> 
<p>He added: “I’ve been a little busy. We have a House Ethics Committee. If it warrants that, I’m sure they’ll look into that.”</p> 
<p>Mills did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

      <title>Congress plots path for Russia sanctions bill with Trump's blessing</title>
      <link>https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/congress-plots-path-forward-on-russia-sanctions-bill-with-trumps-blessing-00660067</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawmakers are quietly discussing how to quickly move new Russia sanctions legislation — this time with President Donald Trump’s blessing.</p> 
<p>“The president has now weighed in, in support of the Russia sanctions legislation,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday, adding that he believed the House would need to make the first move in advancing the measure. However, House GOP leaders have long believed the Senate needs to act first.</p> 
<p>Members of the House and Senate are expected to talk Wednesday about advancing the long-stalled bill after Trump privately told top Republicans he supports it, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).</p> 
<p>Graham also told reporters Wednesday that the White House sent him a statement that very day about the bill, and that lawmakers involved in its drafting have signed off. The bill would impose tariffs on countries that import Russian energy and implement secondary sanctions on foreign firms that support Russian energy production.</p> 
<p>“It's moving,” Graham declared after a closed-door GOP conference lunch.</p> 
<p>Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who is supporting a bipartisan companion bill of Graham’s in the House, said in an interview Wednesday he believes his chamber could quickly pass the sanctions bill if Trump gave his public blessing. Wilson predicted it would receive overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats.</p> 
<p>He conceded that “15 percent” of members of the House GOP Conference “are isolationist” and will vote against Russia sanctions in any scenario. Despite potentially loud protests from that sliver of Republicans, however, Wilson predicted it wouldn’t be enough to tank the effort.</p> 
<p>But House leadership hasn't yet said if, or when, it will take up the Russia sanctions legislation, and Congress is quickly running out of time before the end of the year to take action.</p> 
<p>Thune, on Wednesday, pointed to a December agenda in the Senate already overloaded with appropriations, a defense policy bill, nominations and health care vote.</p> 
<p>Asked if he believed sanctions could pass this year, he said, “we’ll see.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mace moves to censure fellow Republican Mills</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Nancy Mace is moving ahead with an effort to censure and strip a fellow Republican of his committee assignments in a rare intraparty escalation.</p> 
<p>The South Carolina Republican came to the House floor Wednesday afternoon to roll out a measure to formally rebuke Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) over his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/cory-millis-threats-allegations-gop-00496518" target="_blank">alleged ethical violations</a> and to remove him from the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees.</p> 
<p>A vote is expected as soon as Wednesday night on the censure resolution. Republicans are expected to offer a motion to set the matter aside.</p> 
<p>It comes the day after Democrats threatened to force a vote on their own measure to censure Mills — if Republicans were successful in censuring Del. Stacey Plaskett. But Democrats stood down after Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/stacey-plaskett-escapes-censure-vote-epstein-texts-00658334" target="_blank">fell short</a> in efforts to kick the Virgin Islands Democrat off the House Intelligence Committee following revelations she was texting the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 House Oversight Committee hearing. </p> 
<p>The series of events on the House floor sparked accusations from some Republicans that there was a backroom deal between the two parties to facilitate a detente. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries demurred at a press conference Wednesday when asked if he’d cut such a deal, instead re-upping threats to bring forward more censure resolutions against Republicans as partisan tensions boil over across the chamber.</p> 
<p>“Democrats are not going to unilaterally disarm, and there's a long list of Republicans worthy of censure. Not enough time in the legislative calendar if Republicans want to go down this road of censuring members,” Jeffries said.</p> 
<p>Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, one of three House Republicans who voted with all Democrats against the Plaskett censure resolution, said some rank-and-file members tried “to talk me into” voting “yes” but that he “didn’t talk to leadership about the matter.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Speaker Mike Johnson didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry, nor did Mills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bessent talks midterms ‘acid test,’ tariff rebates with House Republicans</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent chatted Wednesday with a group of House Republicans about how voters will judge the GOP’s tax and trade moves heading into the 2026 midterm elections, according to House Budget Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/259549" data-person-id="259549">Jodey Arrington</a>.</p> 
<p>During the private meeting Arrington hosted on Capitol Hill, Bessent discussed President Donald Trump’s economic policy strategy with Republican members of the budget panel, including steps to spurring economic growth and reducing the amount of red ink the federal government racks up each year as the national debt tops $38 trillion.</p> 
<p>The group discussed the “acid test of the midterms,” Arrington said, which is, “Am I doing better today than I did when we first elected this new unified Republican leadership in our nation’s capital?”</p> 
<p>When tax refunds roll in this spring, U.S. voters are going to “see historic refunds” that put “more money in their pockets” thanks to the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_1" target="_blank">GOP megabill</a> Trump signed into law in July, Arrington said. “And that was all part of the plan — of not just bringing prices down and growing the economy but making life more affordable for the American people.”</p> 
<p>The group also discussed Trump’s proposal to send $2,000 rebate checks to Americans by tapping into the hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue generated by the president’s tariffs. Arrington is not a fan of the idea, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/13/republicans-in-congress-lukewarm-to-the-idea-of-tariff-rebate-checks-00650747" target="_blank">like many other Republican lawmakers</a>.</p> 
<p>“The best way to put money in people's pockets is to have good pro-growth policies, and to believe and trust that those policies will work to the end of more jobs and bigger paychecks,” Arrington told reporters after the meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Republicans put pressure on Johnson to advance congressional stock trading ban bill</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two House Republicans vowed Wednesday to pressure Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> and GOP leaders to advance a bill banning congressional stock trading in the coming weeks, not content to settle for a mere hearing on the topic.</p> 
<p>“A bill will come to the floor,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick</a> (R-Pa.) said at a press conference outside the House Administration Committee hearing room, where academics were preparing to testify about the ins and outs of current stock trade ethics enforcement.</p> 
<p>“This is a fist fight, folks,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/306837" data-person-id="306837">Tim Burchett</a> (R-Tenn.) chimed in.</p> 
<p>The lawmakers, appearing alongside Democratic Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/239242" data-person-id="239242">Pramila Jayapal</a> of Washington and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/431425" data-person-id="431425">Seth Magaziner</a> of Rhode Island, have been pushing for Congress to crack down on member stock trading.</p> 
<p>They got a modest win with Johnson’s willingness to let a committee convene a hearing on the politically divisive topic. But they are now doubling down in their efforts to make sure the chamber also holds a markup and floor vote on actual legislation — either the compromise <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_5106?activeTabs=overview" target="_blank">bill requiring members to divest</a> from individual stocks, which the four lawmakers co-sponsored with a bipartisan coalition in September, or another version with similarly strong restrictions.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/364729" data-person-id="364729">Anna Paulina Luna</a> (R-Fla.), who is also advocating for the bipartisan stock trading legislation, said in an interview Tuesday she plans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/inside-congress/2025/11/19/gop-dreams-face-harsh-legislative-reality-00658617" target="_blank">unleash a discharge petition</a> to end-run Johnson and try to force a floor vote on if GOP leaders fail to notice a markup on a congressional stock trading ban bill by the end of Wednesday.</p> 
<p>But House GOP leaders are wary that a bipartisan bill or a similar measure will trigger blowback from a swath of Republicans, including some who say stock trading is an important source of income for themselves and their families.</p> 
<p>Burchett disagreed, saying that if the House votes to ban congressional stock trading, members who are currently skeptical of the idea of a ban behind the scenes are “going to be our biggest cheerleaders[s]” on the chamber floor.</p> 
<p>Political pressure to embrace a ban on stock trading, though, could run up against lawmakers who are protective of their activities in this space.</p> 
<p>Fitzpatrick also warned that members’ individual stock performance will be discussed in hearings on any stock trading bill.</p> 
<p>“Part of the fact finding is what members have done in terms of trading, sometimes on a daily basis,” Fitzpatrick said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virgin Islands Del. Stacey Plaskett on Wednesday expressed no regret for her prior contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 House Oversight Committee hearing.</p> 
<p>In an interview with CNN’s “The Situation Room,” the Democrat acknowledged that she initiated contact with the disgraced financier on the day she was set to question President Donald Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen but refused to say if she regretted the communication.</p> 
<p>“I believe that Jeffrey Epstein had information, and I was going to get information to get at the truth,” Plaskett said. “I’m moving forward, and I think that that’s what we as American people should do.”</p> 
<p>Plaskett, who drew scrutiny recently following the release of documents from the Epstein estate that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/14/epstein-text-messages-cohen-house-hearing/" target="_blank">revealed her texts with him</a>, argued that Epstein was a constituent and that “lots of people were texting me. Lots of people were giving me information.”</p> 
<p>“I’ve been a prosecutor for many years, and there are a lot of people who have information that are not your friends that you use to get information,” she added.</p> 
<p>Still, she admitted that she “probably” would not have asked Cohen about former Trump executive assistant Rhona Graff if Epstein had not mentioned it to her first in their texts.</p> 
<p>During the hearing, Cohen accused Trump of financial fraud, mentioning Graff in his testimony. Epstein appeared to flag the name to Plaskett.</p> 
<p>“Cohen brought up RONA - keeper of the secrets,” Epstein texted, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/14/epstein-text-messages-cohen-house-hearing/" target="_blank">according to The Washington Post</a>. The person believed to be Plaskett asked who — or what — RONA was, adding “Quick I’m up next is that an acronym.”</p> 
<p>Epstein replied “RONA” was actually Trump’s former assistant. Plaskett then questioned Cohen about Graff, who said she was “involved in a lot that went on.”</p> 
<p>Plaskett <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/stacey-plaskett-escapes-censure-vote-epstein-texts-00658334" target="_blank">narrowly avoided a censure</a> in the House on Tuesday, with lawmakers voting 209-214 against formally reprimanding the delegate and removing her from the House Intelligence Committee.</p> 
<p>Both the House and Senate have officially passed legislation forcing the Justice Department to release more information about the federal case it built against Epstein. It now <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/19/congress/senate-clears-epstein-files-bill-00659041" target="_blank">heads to Trump’s desk</a> for his signature.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk, where he has said he will sign it. That comes despite the fact that Speaker Mike Johnson sought eleventh-hour changes to the House-passed bill and didn’t rule out the possibility he would encourage Trump to veto it.</p>

      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:16:45 EST</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) referred a top aide to former special counsel Jack Smith to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution over obstruction of a congressional investigation.</p> 
<p>Thomas Windom, who was senior assistant special counsel under Smith, sat for an interview with congressional investigators in June and a deposition in September.</p> 
<p>In a Wednesday letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Jordan wrote that Windom declined to answer questions by citing a lack of authorization from her department, along with other justifications. But the DOJ had authorized his testimony before he sat for an interview with congressional investigators, Jordan argued.</p> 
<p>“The Committee on the Judiciary writes to refer significant evidence that Thomas Windom, former Senior Assistant Special Counsel to Jack Smith, has, by his conduct during a deposition before the Committee, obstructed a congressional investigation,” Jordan <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-11-19-jdj-to-doj-re-windom-referral.pdf" target="_blank">wrote in the letter</a>.</p> 
<p>This letter is part of a wide-ranging effort from Republicans across both chambers of Congress to target Smith and his office for their investigations into Donald Trump. Republicans have repeatedly argued that Smith’s work constituted a kind of politicization of federal law enforcement, even as Trump has broken with modern precedent by publicly calling on his attorney general to prosecute his political adversaries.</p> 
<p>In July, Jordan subpoenaed Windom to compel his cooperation after the voluntary transcribed interview. At the September deposition, Jordan recalled that Windom’s attorney cited “an unspecified First Amendment privilege, attorney-client privilege, a misguided belief that the Committee had no legitimate legislative purpose for the inquiry, and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.”</p> 
<p>Jordan argued that Windom's justifications were unpersuasive.</p> 
<p>“We have received the letter from Chairman Jordan,” a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement. “Consistent with longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on active or potential investigations. We share the Chairman’s concerns and will continue to ensure that justice is applied fairly and equally to all Americans.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Windom referred to the transcript of his testimony, during which Windom's lawyer argued that Jordan’s probe was unserious and violated Windom’s First Amendment rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House’s hopes for big legislative wins in the coming months are about to crash into the reality of the congressional GOP.</p> 
<p>Deep divisions remain among Republicans over how to address spiking health care costs — and whether they should jam through a potential solution with a party-line vote in the Senate. And, of course, Democrats have little interest in helping them out.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s willingness to go to war against Republicans <a href="https://politico.com/news/2025/11/19/trump-congress-agenda-reconciliation-00658591" target="_blank">isn’t helping party unity</a>.</p> 
<p>The GOP rift is playing out ahead of the end-of-year expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. While vulnerable moderates want GOP leaders to extend the tax credits, Trump and some conservatives are calling for an entirely new framework, like an overhaul of health savings accounts.</p> 
<p>Trump’s top political aide, James Blair, on Tuesday raised the possibility of a megabill sequel — pursuing GOP health care priorities through the party-line reconciliation process, which lets Republicans skirt a Democratic filibuster. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday that Republican leaders are talking to members about the possibility to see if “consensus forms.”</p> 
<p>That pitch is being rejected by Republicans who remember how excruciating it was to pass the megabill this summer. They worry another attempt could undermine efforts to work across the aisle on matters like government funding.</p> 
<p>“I don’t want another one-sided, partisan reconciliation bill right now — I want us to legislate,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who cast a decisive vote in the first package. “Let’s be legislators here. Reconciliation is, yes, it’s a tool for us, but it’s a partisan tool and look at how divided we are right now. … That’s not the way to go.”</p> 
<p>Any attempt at partisan legislation will be complicated by the fact that Republicans are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/donald-trump-epstein-vote-00654761?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=1a9f354b-c3a1-4374-8b80-6845d7848ff4" target="_blank">increasingly willing to break from Trump</a>. (Case in point: Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.)</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson, for his part, acknowledged a lesson that could be crucial for the president to grasp: Today’s enemy could be tomorrow’s indispensable ally.</p> 
<p>“I work on unity in the party, and my encouragement of everybody is to get together,” Johnson said. “We’ve got to do all that in order to deliver for the people.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— House floor action:</b> The House is expected to vote Wednesday to repeal a provision in the shutdown-ending deal that could allow eight GOP senators to collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation for having their electronic records seized during the Biden administration. And while there’s bipartisan support in both chambers to roll back the provision, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who secured the language, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/thune-phone-records-payout-jack-smith-00658393" target="_blank">is standing by it</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House’s dream of clinching major new Republican victories on Capitol Hill before the midterms is crashing into the reality of a bitterly divided Congress.</p> 
<p>Tackling major GOP priorities on the economy and health care was already going to be a heavy lift: There are deep divisions among Republicans about their strategy ahead of the end-of-year expiration of some Affordable Care Act subsidies, and President Donald Trump is showing little appetite to cut a deal with Democrats.</p> 
<p>Trump’s top political aide raised the possibility Tuesday of pursuing another go-it-alone bill, a sequel to the sweeping tax-focused megabill the GOP passed this summer, but going down that road would require building almost complete unity among congressional Republicans.</p> 
<p>And that would have been a tall order even before Trump went to war inside his own party this past week, effectively excommunicating longtime ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) over her criticism of his policies, as well as her support for the release of Justice Department records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> 
<p>The rift comes amid other signs that Republicans in and out of Washington are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/donald-trump-epstein-vote-00654761" target="_blank">growing less willing to follow Trump’s lead</a>, whether on congressional redistricting or overhauling the Senate’s rules. And, with Trump already <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115570813586755288" target="_blank">sketching out red lines</a> on health care, skepticism is growing inside the GOP about burning months of political capital in an election year without a clear path forward.</p> 
<p>Asked this week about the ugly standoff between Greene and Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged a fact of political life that Trump has often struggled to grasp: Today’s enemy could be tomorrow’s indispensable ally.</p> 
<p>“I work on unity in the party, and my encouragement of everybody is to get together,” Johnson said. “We've got to do all that in order to deliver for the people.”</p> 
<p>Johnson’s peacemaker stance comes as House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-gop-leaders-pitch-members-on-unaffordable-care-act-00656362" target="_blank">privately plot a health care overhaul</a>, with GOP leaders pitching their members on policy options during a closed-door conference meeting Tuesday. One slide shared by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise during the meeting knocked the expiring Obamacare subsidies, calling them part of the “Unaffordable Care Act.”</p> 
<p>Around the same time, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/white-house-health-bill-tariffs-00655917" target="_blank">at a Bloomberg News event</a> sketched out a major “affordability” bill that could include $2,000 checks that Trump has pitched as tariff “dividends” as well as health care legislation along the lines of what House Republicans are discussing.</p> 
<p>Those ideas are not likely to get Democratic buy-in — especially with less than a year before the midterms. That means the GOP would have to explore party-line approaches to passing any policy agenda. But Senate Republicans have spurned Trump’s demands that they eliminate the filibuster that requires bipartisan buy-in for most legislation, leaving the convoluted reconciliation process, which was used to pass this summer’s megabill, as their only viable choice.</p> 
<p>Talk of another reconciliation bill has been hanging around Hill GOP circles for months, ever since House leaders dangled the promise of a second bite at party-line legislation to conservative hard-liners earlier this year in exchange for their votes to pass the “big, beautiful bill.”</p> 
<p>But <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/05/second-megabill-doubts-republicans-00545855" target="_blank">that push appeared to fizzle</a> earlier this fall. And just two weeks ago, during a meeting with Senate Republicans, Trump himself expressed skepticism about how much another reconciliation bill could accomplish. Some Republicans still want to try and revive the idea for the spring, but they are facing a hard sell with many members who remember the political trauma their party suffered amid attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017.</p> 
<p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said in an interview that she did not want to pursue a GOP-only health care bill, arguing that it would undermine efforts to work with Democrats on other issues like funding the government </p> 
<p>“I don’t want another one-sided, partisan reconciliation bill right now — I want us to legislate,” Murkowski said. “Let’s be legislators here. Reconciliation is, yes, it’s a tool for us, but it’s a partisan tool and look at how divided we are right now. … That’s not the way to go.”</p> 
<p>Republicans have barely any room for error if they are going to launch another party-line policy bill. Murkowski, notably, was a decisive vote in getting the first GOP megabill through the Senate over the summer — after helping to sink the 2017 partisan health care bill.</p> 
<p>To get another reconciliation bill passed now, Republicans would need to lean on their most vulnerable members during a time in the election cycle when party leaders typically become shy about making their front-liners take politically tough votes that could negatively ricochet in swing districts.</p> 
<p>Retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who voted against the reconciliation bill in July, left the door open to pursuing a new party-line bill. But underscoring the headache waiting for GOP leaders and the administration, he floated using it to at least partially address some of what he called the “problematic” policies from the first Republican megabill.</p> 
<p>He also voiced a concern that has taken root with many of his House and GOP Senate colleagues — that if they are going to make a second run at reconciliation, they need to be unified at the outset about the nature of the end product rather than figuring it out along the way.</p> 
<p>“It could go sideways real quick if the scope changes much, so we’d have to have a lot of agreement up front to make sure it was going to be successful,” he said in an interview.</p> 
<p>Inside the closed-door conference meeting across the Capitol Tuesday morning, GOP leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-gop-leaders-pitch-members-on-unaffordable-care-act-00656362" target="_blank">got pushback</a> to their ambitious health care agenda from Rep. Nathaniel Moran (R-Texas), who asked why they had waited until just weeks before the expiration deadline for the Obamacare subsidies.</p> 
<p>House Republicans, Moran countered in the meeting, should have been working on alternatives months ago, according to four people granted anonymity to share the private exchange.</p> 
<p>GOP leadership aides and senior Republicans on Capitol Hill say they have been waiting for months for Trump to outline what he wants on health care. But the president only started weighing in publicly on policy options in recent days.</p> 
<p>The president on Tuesday warned that the only thing he would support would be a bill that sends “THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE,” adding that Congress should “not waste your time and energy on anything else” and “GET IT DONE, NOW.”</p> 
<p>Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) added that Trump’s proposal — to essentially restructure the subsidies to give them directly to Americans — was a “welcome discussion … but we’re not going to get that done before Dec. 31. That’s unlikely.”</p> 
<p>Asked about Trump’s comments, Senate Majority Leader John Thune didn’t close the door Tuesday night to the chances lawmakers could reach a bipartisan health care deal, but he said that would be up to what Democrats would be willing to accept. They have been cool to the health savings account ideas favored by the GOP.</p> 
<p>“We’ve got members who are very interested in addressing the affordability of health care,” Thune added. “The question is, what’s the best way to do it.”</p> 
<p>Senate Budget Committee Republicans are keen to advance a budget resolution that would unlock the filibuster-skirting power of a second reconciliation bill, but they are tentatively looking at early next year to do that. And they are getting pushback from their colleagues behind the scenes.</p> 
<p>When Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana pitched fellow Senate Republicans during a caucus lunch about using the fast-track procedure to pass a health care plan, a colleague pointed out that many of the GOP’s favorite policies wouldn’t comply with the strict rules governing the budget reconciliation process, according to an attendee who was granted anonymity to describe the private discussion.</p> 
<p>Kennedy acknowledged in an interview he can’t guarantee a bill will ever make it to the floor, but he suggested there was a pent-up feeling among some Republicans that Congress, despite being in GOP hands, has little to show for their majority.</p> 
<p>“That’s the problem — nothing’s happened. We’re not doing anything. I think some of that was reflected in the [off-year] elections” earlier this month, Kennedy said.</p> 
<p>“Everybody says, what about the One Big Beautiful Bill? That was yesterday — I mean what have we done since then?” he continued. “We haven’t done anything for months, and a lot of people — you are talking to one — are sick of it.”</p>

      <title>Thune denies Johnson’s demand for Epstein bill changes</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson said he voted for the Jeffrey Epstein disclosure bill Tuesday based on his hope that the Senate would make changes he’s been demanding. Senate Majority Leader John Thune shot that down.</p> 
<p>Thune said Tuesday evening that, while he had talked with the speaker about the bill, he and Senate GOP legal counsel decided the legislation was “sufficient.” The Senate effectively <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-approves-epstein-files-bill-in-near-unanimous-vote-00656764" target="_blank">approved the legislation</a> by unanimous consent mere hours after House passage Tuesday afternoon without provisions sought by Johnson, including additional victim and whistleblower name protections.</p> 
<p>"I talked with the speaker a bit, and we've been in consultation obviously with the White House on this for some time,” Thune told reporters. “The conclusion was when it came out of the House 427-1 that, you know, it was going to pass in the Senate.”</p> 
<p>Thune’s refusal to amend the bill was just the latest setback Johnson has faced in the Epstein saga, where the Louisiana Republican saw a rank-and-file member of his own party, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), pull off a stunning legislative end-run despite the speaker’s months-long opposition campaign.</p> 
<p>Johnson said after House passage Tuesday that he would “insist upon” changes.</p> 
<p>“I talked to John Thune over the weekend. I just texted him. We’re going to get together. We’ll talk about this,” Johnson told reporters as he left the floor. “There’s an easy way to amend the legislation to make sure that we don’t do permanent damage to the justice system. And I’m going to insist upon that.”</p> 
<p>Asked if he would press Trump to veto the bill if the Senate didn’t amend it, Johnson said he would “cross that bridge” if necessary. He also raised “national security” concerns about the bill Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Thune said Senate Republican lawyers examined the legislation and determined it could go forward without being amended.</p> 
<p>“Our lawyers obviously had looked closely at some of the issues and had concluded that the bill I think was, you know, sufficient to accomplish what needed to be done here, and that is to get the information out there as quickly as possible,” Thune said.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, Johnson told reporters he had received “some comfort” from the Senate that the chamber would make the changes. But Thune never publicly indicated he expected the Senate to revise the bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/senate-pass-epstein-thune-00657429" target="_blank">and even warned earlier Tuesday</a> that changes were unlikely.</p> 
<p>The only short-lived whiff of resistance that appeared in the Senate Tuesday came from Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who appeared to raise concerns at the last minute but did not block the effort.</p> 
<p>“We were trying to see if we needed to change language to protect the victims,” Mullin said to reporters.</p> 
<p>Shortly before Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought unanimous consent to greenlight the bill, Mullin said that there had been a “conversation” with the administration about what the Oklahoma Republican characterized as “technical changes,” which ultimately didn't get made.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Plaskett narrowly escapes censure over her Epstein texts</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House voted 209-214 Tuesday night against formally reprimanding Del. Stacey Plaskett for communicating with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 Oversight Committee hearing.</p> 
<p>Three House Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, Lance Gooden of Texas and Dave Joyce of Ohio — voted with all Democrats against the measure. Three Republicans voted present: Reps. Andrew Garbarino of New York, Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania and Jay Obernolte of California.</p> 
<p>Plaskett drew scrutiny after documents released from the Epstein estate revealed her texts with him. She’s denied wrongdoing, saying on the House floor Tuesday that Epstein was a constituent, that her contact was limited to information-gathering and that it was not public information at the time that Epstein had been under federal investigation.</p> 
<p>“I know how to question individuals. I know how to seek information. I have sought information from confidential informants, from murderers, from other individuals because I want the truth,” she said on the House floor.</p> 
<p>Republicans contend Plaskett’s contact with Epstein was more substantive and shaped her questioning during the hearing, which Plaskett denies.</p> 
<p>“Standing against a convicted predator's influence in our proceedings is not partisan. It's basic decency,” said Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), who brought the measure to the House floor through a fast-track process bypassing committees and Hill leadership.</p> 
<p>But the measure rejected Tuesday by the House would have also removed Plaskett from the House Intelligence Committee, a step too far for some lawmakers. She would have been the latest House Democrats to be removed from a committee position by Hill Republicans after Republicans voted last Congress to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for her past comments on Israel.</p> 
<p>The failed vote to reprimand Plaskett comes on the same day the House voted almost unanimously to force the Department of Justice to release more files about its case against Epstein. The controversy has roiled Congress and <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/mtg-speaks-on-epstein-00656279" target="_blank">split the MAGA base</a> for months.</p> 
<p>In retaliation for the move against Plaskett, Democrats introduced a measure to censure Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) and to remove him from the House Armed Services Committee. He’s faced a spate of ethical issues including an since-withdrawn allegation of assault and an ongoing legal dispute over a previous relationship. But that measure is likely to be withdrawn now that the Plaskett effort has failed.</p> 
<p>The failure of the Plaskett measure prompted an outcry from conservative Republicans who had pushed for it, with some accusing leaders of cutting deals to avoid a vote on the Mills resolution. </p> 
<p>"They’re brokering back end deals to avoid bringing forward justice in both Democrat and Republican chambers," said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.). "So it’s literally covering up public corruption."</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House plans to vote Wednesday to <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_6019" target="_blank">repeal a provision</a> that could award eight GOP senators hundreds of thousands of dollars for having their phone records seized without their knowledge during a Biden-era probe. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who secured the measure, is standing his ground.</p> 
<p>"The House is going to do what they are going to do with it,” he told reporters Tuesday night. “It doesn't apply to them.”</p> 
<p>But many senators from both parties are eager to roll back the legislative language they didn’t know <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/john-thune-government-funding-phone-records-seizure-00646094" target="_blank">Thune secretly negotiated</a>with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the government funding package that ended the longest shutdown in history last week. Republicans could revolt if leadership doesn’t give them a vote to overturn it.</p> 
<p>In interviews Tuesday with nearly a dozen lawmakers, confusion, frustration and anger ran rampant about what has quickly become branded as a politically toxic, taxpayer-funded windfall for a select few. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) went so far as to quip there could be “some stabbings” at the Senate GOP’s weekly lunch Wednesday when the topic will inevitably get discussed.</p> 
<p>“Whoever put this in had an obligation to tell us about it, and they didn’t,” said Kennedy. “There's something called trust and good faith around here.”</p> 
<p>Even Schumer conceded the widely unpopular language should ultimately be scrapped.</p> 
<p>“The bottom line is, Thune wanted the provision and we wanted to make sure that at least Democratic senators were protected from [Attorney General Pam] Bondi and others who might go after them,” he said Tuesday. “But I'd be for repealing all of it and I hope that happens,” he told reporters.</p> 
<p>It’s not clear whether it’s too late to reverse course in the Senate.</p> 
<p>The provision at issue, which President Donald Trump signed into law last week, would award senators $500,000 or more if they discover their electronic records were seized without notification.</p> 
<p>In seeking to attach it to the funding bill, Thune was directly responding to furor from several Senate Republicans eager for retribution against former special counsel Jack Smith, who obtained the phone records for at least eight Republican senators during his investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p> 
<p>Thune in an interview acknowledged that members would indeed discuss the issue at lunch Wednesday but reiterated that he personally was not having second thoughts about including the measure in the funding deal.</p> 
<p>“It’s designed to protect United States senators,” Thune said. “We have a number of people who are interested in making sure that that sort of thing has a consequence if that kind of weaponization of the government along the lines of what Jack Smith did is ever employed again in the future.”</p> 
<p>Senate Commerce Chair Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who claims he was targeted by the Smith probe, praised Thune for including the language. Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is confirmed to have had his records subpoenaed during the Smith investigation, has said he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/13/senate-republicans-phones-sue-jack-smith-00651463" target="_blank">plans to take advantage</a> of the provision to make it “so painful” for those involved.</p> 
<p>Some Senate Republicans admitted they hope the language is preserved. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) said he wanted the provision expanded to let a broader range of parties sue to show “how corrupt Jack Smith is.”</p> 
<p>It’s far from certain disgruntled lawmakers would make it easy for Thune to move a standalone bill to revoke the provision, even if he decides he wants to — they could insist on controversial amendments or make the voting process drawn-out and disruptive. Nor is it clear Republicans would allow the provision to be stripped in a subsequent government funding bill.</p> 
<p>There's far less hand-wringing in the House, where members were criticizing the language before they even voted on the Senate-passed funding bill last Thursday.</p> 
<p>The House Wednesday evening is expected to easily pass a bill to repeal the payout provision with support from Speaker Mike Johnson and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, who is working to get Smith to sit for a transcribed interview before his committee.</p> 
<p>In the Senate, several lawmakers signaled Tuesday night they were anxious to distance themselves from the new policy and wanted to follow the House’s lead.</p> 
<p>"I’m going to support repealing it,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), the chair of the legislative branch appropriations subcommittee.</p> 
<p>He added he was not alerted about the language until after he already voted for the funding package last week and that he later received an “apologetic” call from GOP leadership over how the matter was handled. Thune confirmed that he had spoken to Mullin and that the Oklahoma Republican was not aware of the provision’s drafting.</p> 
<p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was likewise in the dark in advance of the vote.</p> 
<p>“That was something that the leaders put into the bill, and I played no role in that whatsoever,” she told reporters.</p> 
<p>Democrats made clear they would continue to pummel Republicans if Thune failed to take action.</p> 
<p>Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the ranking member on the legislative branch appropriations subcommittee, said he was “furious” with leadership and has since introduced a bill to pare back the provision.</p> 
<p>Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), another senior appropriator, said in an interview his party was “going to make every effort to try to reverse that pretty serious mistake.”</p> 
<p>“I guess there's an argument that it offers some future protection, but that's not what the provision is about,” he said. “The provision is about a cash payout to Republican senators, plain and simple.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans are pushing ahead with an investigation into the activities of Jeffrey Epstein — even as legislation forcing the release of all Department of Justice files on the late sex offender appears to be heading to President Donald Trump for a signature.</p> 
<p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a series of subpoenas Tuesday for some of Epstein's financial records. </p> 
<p>Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), chairman of the committee, issued subpoenas to J.P. Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank and requested additional documents from U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Gordon Rhea.</p> 
<p>According to the subpoenas, JPMorgan Chase began an internal investigation into accounts previously held by Epstein, flagging some 4,700 transactions as “suspicious” in the process. Epstein also held accounts at and banked with Deutsche Bank from 2013 until potentially late 2018, the subpoenas state.</p> 
<p>The letter to Rhea comes after documents released last week reveal that Del. Stacey Plaskett <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/14/epstein-text-messages-cohen-house-hearing/" target="_blank">consulted with Epstein</a>during a 2019 hearing with Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Epstein previously owned the islands of Little St. James and Great St. James. The House on Tuesday <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/stacey-plaskett-house-censure-vote-epstein-00657247" target="_blank">will vote to censure Plaskett</a> and remove her from the House Intelligence Committee. </p> 
<p>“The records sought by this subpoena will assist in the Committee’s oversight of the federal government’s enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell,” the subpoenas to the banks read.</p> 
<p>The subpoenas were announced just after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-approves-epstein-files-bill-in-near-unanimous-vote-00656764" target="_blank">the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly</a> to force the Justice Department to release more information about the case it built against Epstein. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Utah congressional map, which creates a safe-blue district, will force the four current Republican members of the delegation to compete for three GOP seats.</p> 
<p>The four Republicans have discussed possible configurations, though no final decision has been made, according to two people aware of the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the dynamic. The congresspeople have publicly said they will make no decision until the map is finalized, anticipating potential legal appeals.</p> 
<p>“We're still waiting to see if there might be one other change,” said Rep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah). “In the meanwhile, we’re not going to speculate.”</p> 
<p>Leaders of the Republican-controlled Utah legislature vowed to appeal after a district judge tossed out the GOP-leaning map the legislature drew and selected a plaintiff’s map on November 10. But over a week has passed without lawmakers filing the appeal. Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCejuZn1uzg" target="_blank">told a local TV station</a> the deadline to appeal the 2026 map “has come and gone.”</p> 
<p>"We don't know what's going to happen for 2026,” Schultz said. “We're hoping for some miracle to come in and say, ‘No, this isn't right.’”</p> 
<p>If the map holds, many expect Owens, who has served since 2021, to retire, leaving Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) in the northern Utah district and Reps. Celeste Maloy and Mike Kennedy to split the other two.</p> 
<p>“The thing we're good at in politics in Utah that a lot of other states struggle with, is talking to each other and working together and figuring out what's best for the state,” Maloy said. “We're still in the process of doing that, but I'm confident we can figure it out.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.), the lone "no" vote on the near-unanimous House legislation to force a release of the Justice Department’s files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, said on Tuesday that he opposed it on privacy grounds.</p> 
<p>“It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America,” <a href="https://x.com/RepClayHiggins/status/1990868089056219267" target="_blank">Higgins wrote</a> on X. “As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people — witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc. If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-approves-epstein-files-bill-in-near-unanimous-vote-00656764" target="_blank">Four hundred and twenty-seven House lawmakers</a> — including 216 Republicans — voted in favor of the legislation on Tuesday, two days after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/jeffrey-epstein-vote-house-republicans-00652460" target="_blank">President Donald Trump urged his party to support it on Truth Social</a>.</p> 
<p>The White House had spent months lobbying against the effort.</p> 
<p>Higgins, a staunch supporter of the president, nevertheless voted against it. But this isn’t his final word on the matter, he said.</p> 
<p>“If the Senate amends the bill to properly address privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House,” he said.</p> 
<p>The Senate could soon clear the bill. Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that the chamber could potentially pass it by unanimous consent <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/senate-pass-epstein-thune-00657429" target="_blank">as soon as later Tuesday</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>For the latest</b>, read <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-approves-epstein-files-bill-in-near-unanimous-vote-00656764" target="_blank"><i>Senate approves Epstein files bill, sending it to Trump’s desk</i></a>.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he expects the Senate will pass the bill to release DOJ files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as soon as Tuesday, a move that would send it to President Donald Trump for his signature.</p> 
<p>Thune told reporters the Senate could possibly pass it by unanimous consent, a maneuver that requires agreement from all 100 senators. The House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-approves-epstein-files-bill-in-near-unanimous-vote-00656764" target="_blank">passed it</a> 427-1 with only Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) voting in opposition. </p> 
<p>“My assumption is the president sounds like he’s prepared to sign it," Thune said. "So I’d assume it would move fairly quickly over here."</p> 
<p>Senate leadership on Tuesday afternoon began checking the temperature of its members to see if anyone would object.</p> 
<p>The possibility of quick action in the Senate is a shift from just last week when it was expected that the chamber would bury the Epstein bill. But Trump’s insistence that Republicans should pass it, and that he would be willing to sign it, has changed the dynamic within the Senate GOP conference.</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson has called on the Senate to add more privacy protections for victims and whistleblowers. But Thune, pointing to the overwhelming vote total in the House, predicted that was “not likely” to happen.</p> 
<p>Democrats have signaled they would oppose any efforts to change the bill. </p> 
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer added that once the House bill gets to the Senate he will try to set up a vote on the bill, which would force Republicans to go on the record instead of letting it pass without a formal vote.</p> 
<p>“We have an opportunity to get this bill done today and have it on the president’s desk to be signed into law tonight. We should seize that opportunity," Schumer said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House is set to vote Tuesday evening on a measure censuring Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett for being in contact with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Lawmakers sank a Democratic-led effort to send the measure to the House Ethics Committee by a nearly party-line 214-213 vote. Two Republican lawmakers, Reps. Lance Gooden of Texas and Dave Joyce of Ohio, voted with all Democrats to have the Ethics panel take up the resolution instead. </p> 
<p>Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina brought up the measure through a fast-track process bypassing Hill leadership and committees. It would deliver a formal rebuke of Plaskett and remove her from the House Intelligence Committee. </p> 
<p>If the measure is adopted tonight, Plaskett would be the latest House Democrat to be removed from her committee role. Republicans voted last Congress to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/02/house-gop-ilhan-omar-00080771" target="_blank">remove</a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/02/house-gop-ilhan-omar-00080771" target="_blank">Rep. Ilhan Omar</a> (D-Minn.) from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for her past comments about Israel. </p> 
<p>Documents released from Epstein’s estate showed the nonvoting delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/14/epstein-text-messages-cohen-house-hearing/" target="_blank">texting</a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/14/epstein-text-messages-cohen-house-hearing/" target="_blank">with Epstein</a> during a congressional hearing in 2019. </p> 
<p>Tuesday’s votes come on the same day the House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-approves-epstein-files-bill-in-near-unanimous-vote-00656764" target="_blank">voted nearly unanimously</a> to force the Justice Department to release more information about its case against Epstein. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>House votes to rebuke García for election maneuvers</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House voted to rebuke Rep. Chuy García of Illinois for announcing his retirement after the filing deadline — a maneuver that has positioned his chief of staff to be elected his successor in a reliably blue district in the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>The 236-183 vote on the symbolic resolution of disapproval divided Democrats, with 23 members of the minority party ultimately voting with all Republicans to reprimand one of their own.</p> 
<p>Four lawmakers voted “present:” Democratic Reps. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia, alongside Republican Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio.</p> 
<p>Democrats have been hand-wringing over the matter since last week, when Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez introduced the nonbinding resolution against García through a fast-track process that allowed her to bypass leadership — and catch her colleagues off guard.</p> 
<p>Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington is a purple-district moderate who frequently bucks the rest of her party, but her antagonism of García was seen as going a bridge too far by many Democrats who have been trying to project unity coming out of the longest-ever government shutdown.</p> 
<p>Democratic leaders whipped against the resolution and urged members to vote against it in their closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday morning. Gluesenkamp Perez attended the meeting but didn’t speak up when leaders spoke against her effort, according to four people granted anonymity to describe the sensitive situation.</p> 
<p>“We disagree with the resolution that’s being offered and we should be talking about issues that affect the American people,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the third-ranking House Democrat.</p> 
<p>Some Democrats defended García, who has denied accusations of wrongdoing and said his decision to retire <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/03/congress/jesus-chuy-garcia-retirement-watch-00634349" target="_blank"><u>earlier this month</u></a> was based on his personal health and the needs of his family.</p> 
<p>But many others said they had a hard time explaining away the fact that García’s chief of staff, Patty Garcia, filed her papers with Illinois election officials days before her boss announced his decision to retire — timing that appeared designed to clear the primary field.</p> 
<p>Democrats who voted for the disapproval resolution, though, underscored it wasn’t personal. Gluesenkamp Perez also said Monday night she had nothing against García, but “you cannot win the right to represent people through subversion.”</p> 
<p>Democratic leaders unsuccessfully tried Monday evening to kill the measure altogether, but Gluesenkamp Perez and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) sided with all Republicans against doing so, forcing a final vote on the matter Tuesday afternoon.</p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report included an incorrect vote tally.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate moved swiftly to approve legislation Tuesday forcing the Justice Department to release more information about the case it built against the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — acting hours after an overwhelming House vote to send the bill to the desk of President Donald Trump, who spent months trying to kill it.</p> 
<p>The Senate acted by unanimous consent, which requires signoff from every senator but does not require them to take a roll call vote. Earlier in the day, the House passed the bill on a 427-1 vote.</p> 
<p>“This is about giving the American people the transparency they've been crying for,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said before asking for the bill’s approval. “Jeffrey Epstein's victims have waited long enough.”</p> 
<p>Tuesday’s votes caps off a months of drama among congressional Republicans and the White House over how to handle the Epstein files, pitting GOP lawmakers between Trump and their own base.</p> 
<p>That included a long campaign to circumvent House Republican leaders and White House officials who fought tooth and nail to convince members of their party to oppose the measure. As Democrats sought to stoke division in the GOP over the administration’s decision to withhold further information in the Epstein case, the issue proved increasingly toxic for Republicans — and Tuesday’s vote<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/jeffrey-epstein-vote-house-republicans-00652460" target="_blank">became inevitable</a>.</p> 
<p>“We have a chance today to make something happen, something that has not happened and should have happened decades ago, and that is to get justice for these victims and survivors and transparency for America,” said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who led the effort to force a House vote, later adding that he was “embarrassed for my own party today.”</p> 
<p>Only Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.), a fervent Trump loyalist, voted against it. Victims of Epstein who had gathered in the House gallery cheered as the vote closed.</p> 
<p>Senate GOP leadership had previously downplayed the odds their chamber would take up the House’s Epstein bill, raising the likelihood that even if Massie and his allies were successful it would just be buried across the Capitol.</p> 
<p>That all changed over the weekend and Monday when Trump reversed course and urged House lawmakers to pass the bill and said that he would sign it. That reflected concerns that the fight was threatening to overshadow the party’s message as Trump tries to focus on the rising cost of living.</p> 
<p>Speaker Mike Johnson called on the Senate to add more privacy protections for victims and whistleblowers, a concern Higgins cited in<a href="https://x.com/RepClayHiggins/status/1990868089056219267" target="_blank">explaining his vote</a> against the bill. But that would have required the bill to come back to the House for final approval.</p> 
<p>There is a broad desire in the GOP to pass the bill and move on to other legislative business, and Thune predicted that it would move “fairly quickly” through the Senate without changes.</p> 
<p>The political quagmire began for Republicans in July, when the Department of Justice released a memo saying it would not disclose further information in the Epstein case. Quickly, Democrats accused Trump and his allies of reneging on a commitment to transparency.</p> 
<p>The pressure culminated at an otherwise routine House Oversight subcommittee hearing in July, just ahead of the chamber’s summer recess. Democratic lawmakers, joined by a few Republicans, voted to subpoena information from the Justice Department in the Epstein case — launching a wide-ranging Oversight probe into Epstein and the Justice Department’s handling of the case.</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders have repeatedly pointed to that probe to argue that the effort led by Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to discharge the measure from committee and force an up-or-down vote on the legislation was unnecessary. Their bill would compel only the Justice Department to release information in its possession within 30 days of its enactment.</p> 
<p>The Oversight panel has already subpoenaed Epstein’s estate, which produced a “birthday book” and a number of emails that contained materials damaging to Trump.</p> 
<p>Trump’s relationship with the convicted sex offender has seen intense scrutiny, with Democrats accusing him of supporting a coverup. The president has maintained the two had a falling out years ago, and no evidence has linked Trump to wrongdoing in the Epstein case.</p> 
<p>But recent revelations in emails sent by Epstein suggested Trump “knew about the girls,” and the news has only increased pressure on his administration to release further information in the case.</p> 
<p>The Justice Department has so far released relatively few nonpublic materials to lawmakers as part of the Oversight probe, which was partially held up by the recent 43-day government shutdown. But many GOP lawmakers doubt the bill will trigger the release of much new information from DOJ, including Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.).</p> 
<p>“I think the Department of Justice has turned over what they’re legally allowed to turn over,” Comer said.</p> 
<p>Even before the Massie-Khanna discharge effort had succeeded and the bill passed the House, Senate Democrats were preparing to force Thune and his GOP members to vote quickly on the bill. Schumer warned that Democrats would oppose any efforts to water down the House language before it was sent on to Trump’s desk and relished in the GOP infighting.</p> 
<p>“In trying to hide the truth, Donald Trump has provoked the fiercest rebellion that he has faced among his supporters both in Congress and in the country,” Schumer said.</p> 
<p>Prior to Trump’s endorsement of the effort, the White House carried out a monthslong pressure campaign to try to prevent the forced vote in the House from happening.</p> 
<p>Trump and White House officials specifically pushed the three Republican women who signed onto the discharge petition — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.) and Nancy Mace (S.C.) — to take their names off the effort, especially once it was clear that the swearing-in of Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva would prompt a vote.</p> 
<p>Boebert was even called into the White House Situation Room to try to get her to remove her name.Mace said in an interview that the floor action, after months of drama, is “also a symbolic vote for other survivors who’ve never gotten justice.”“It's a symbolism of justice for all of us. So, I'm emotional about it right now,” she said.</p> 
<p>Trump’s pressure campaign also included a public split with Greene, once one of his most vocal supporters in the House. Greene, who has also split with Trump recently over health care and economic matters, said her fissure with Trump “has all come down to the Epstein files.”</p> 
<p>“This has been one of the most destructive things to MAGA — is watching the man that we supported early on, three elections,” oppose the bill, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/18/congress/mtg-speaks-on-epstein-00656279" target="_blank">Greene told reporters Tuesday</a>. “Watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Phillip Swagel, the director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, told lawmakers at an oversight hearing Tuesday morning before the House Budget Committee that the “sophisticated cyberattack” against his agency two weeks ago has been contained and there is currently no “further evidence of unauthorized access to CBO email.”</p> 
<p>It's the first time he has spoken out publicly about the breach.</p> 
<p>Swagel said the investigation is “extensive and ongoing” as the agency receives assistance from both federal security partners and private sector security specialists.</p> 
<p>He stressed that as more information becomes available about the nature of the attack — including “the threat actor’s activities” and what can be done to strengthen CBO’s systems — he will provide lawmakers updates “in a closed-door setting.”</p> 
<p>He warned that sharing some things during a public hearing “might hinder remediation or investigation” but insisted that CBO is now “operating as normal … without interruption.”</p> 
<p>In advance of the hearing, House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington praised the CBO’s handling of the incident.</p> 
<p>“They notified everybody, and all hands were on deck to address it, remediate it, and make sure that no further information was breached,” the Texas Republican said in an interview Monday night. “I thought they handled that responsibly and there was a great sense of urgency and concern, which is what I would expect.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Chuy García has denied purposely clearing a path for his chief of staff to take his seat without facing a primary, but a <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-9844-df0f-abfa-f96ed12a0000" target="_blank">document filed with Illinois elections officials</a> shows he was the first to sign her nominating petitions, days before he announced his retirement.</p> 
<p>García said Tuesday in a note to Democratic colleagues obtained by POLITICO that he “did not circulate petitions for any Congressional campaign except my own.” But that obscures his apparent knowledge of the effort by his top aide, Patty Garcia, to get on the ballot.</p> 
<p>A <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-9844-df0f-abfa-f96ed12a0000" target="_blank">petition signature page</a> submitted by Patty Garcia to the Illinois Board of Elections shows the representative and his closest allies, whom Chuy García has also helped get elected over the years, signed their names. They include Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya, Illinois state Sen. Celina Villanueva, state Reps. Aaron Ortiz and Norma Hernandez, and Chicago City Council members Jeylú Gutiérrez and Michael Rodriguez.</p> 
<p>The form is dated Nov. 1, two days before the filing deadline and three days before Chuy García formally announced his retirement. Patty Garcia ultimately filed nearly 3,000 signatures to qualify for the Democratic primary ballot. The two are not related.</p> 
<p>Fabiola Rodriguez-Ciampoli, a spokesperson for Chuy Garcia, said signing a petition is not the same as circulating them. "He did not circulate petitions" for his chief of staff's campaign, she said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republican leaders delivered a presentation to members Tuesday morning slamming the enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act that are due to expire at the end of the year.</p> 
<p>It comes as members of both parties and chambers are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/aca-obamacare-subsidies-extension-00655842" target="_blank">rushing to develop, and pass, legislation</a> to lower health care costs by Dec. 31, when the Obamacare subsidies will expire and premiums are set to go through the roof.</p> 
<p>There are multiple opinions among Republicans about whether the best path forward to keep the price of health care down involves extending the tax credits — possibly with some modifications to appease conservatives — or constructing an entirely new framework, like an overhaul of health savings accounts.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump weighed in Tuesday morning on behalf of the latter approach, saying "THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES."</p> 
<p>"Congress, do not waste your time and energy on anything else," he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115570813586755288" target="_blank">wrote on Truth Social</a>.</p> 
<p>A slide deck shared by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise in the Tuesday meeting made clear that House GOP leadership also falls in the overhaul camp. One slide viewed by POLITICO was titled “The Unaffordable Care Act,” and highlighted statistics showing that premiums have increased by 80 percent since the ACA’s passage. It also claimed that more than 50 percent of Obamacare enrollees did not file a single claim this year.</p> 
<p>Walking into the meeting, Scalise said in a brief interview that he planned to keep talking with the chairs of three key committees of jurisdiction over health policy — Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Education and the Workforce.</p> 
<p>“A lot of members have called me or texted me during the break about the bills they have, and I've been making sure everybody's directed to the committees and talk to the chairman,” Scalise said. “Ultimately, we're gonna go through regular order on this.”</p> 
<p>But the leadership’s position is making some Republicans nervous — and frustrated. At one point during the meeting, Rep. Nathaniel Moran, a Republican in a deep-red Texas district, challenged GOP leaders on why they were now blasting the enhanced Obamacare tax credits just weeks before their expiration date.</p> 
<p>House Republicans, Moran continued, should have been talking about alternatives months ago, according to four people granted anonymity to share a private exchange inside the meeting room.</p> 
<p>Republican leaders are also facing intense pressure from vulnerable GOP moderates to extend the expiring premium tax credits.</p> 
<p>But other House Republicans were unapologetic Tuesday about their desire to put a conservative imprint on health care policy. Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas), the chair of the Republican Study Committee, said after the presentation his party should “absolutely” pursue the party-line budget reconciliation process to pass a GOP health care bill.</p> 
<p>“The Democrats are incapable of coming up with a plan that is competitive, transparent and actually reduces costs,” said Pfluger, who has been hosting RSC discussions on policies for a second partisan policy package that can pass with a simple majority in the Senate. “The No. 1 bucket that we are focused on in a reconciliation 2.0 is affordability.”</p> 
<p>House GOP leaders have not given a timeline for any health care package, but are planning to unveil at least several bills on the topic before the end of the year, according to three people granted anonymity to describe internal strategy discussions.</p> 
<p>As House Republicans huddled in the basement of the Capitol building for the first time since September, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair told reporters at a separate event Tuesday morning that while there’s some interest in a bipartisan discussion on health policy, “Dems have not really demonstrated an interest in having constructive conversations.”</p> 
<p>In recent weeks, Blair has been hosting health policy meetings at the White House with providers and representatives from hospitals, along with White House legislative staff, according to one person granted anonymity to share details of the private gatherings. It’s a sign that the administration is taking the political ramifications of the credits’ expirations seriously, with Democrats likely to hammer the GOP on the issue in the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>Democrats are so far continuing to dig their heels in on a “clean” extension of the subsidies. But many moderate Democrats are willing to negotiate modifications as part of an extension.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the once steadfast ally of Donald Trump who has since fallen out with the president, said the saga around convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has “ripped MAGA apart.”</p> 
<p>Greene made her comments while flanked by some of Epstein’s victims outside the Capitol on Tuesday, just hours before the House is set to vote on a bill that would force the Justice Department to release Epstein case files.</p> 
<p>The White House led an aggressive campaign to pare back Republican support for the effort, but Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/jeffrey-epstein-vote-house-republicans-00652460" target="_blank">ultimately gave a nod of approval</a> for the measure after Greene and three other Republicans joined Democrats to force it to the House floor.</p> 
<p>Trump, however, has angrily withdrawn his support for Greene — an early supporter of Trump and his Make America Great Again movement — and called her Marjorie “Traitor” Greene.</p> 
<p>“This has been one of the most destructive things to MAGA — is watching the man that we supported early on, three elections,” oppose the bill, she told reporters. “Watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.”</p> 
<p>The back-and-forth battle over releasing the files has certainly driven some Republicans into contortions — not least of whom is Speaker Mike Johnson.</p> 
<p>He told reporters Tuesday that he plans to vote for the bill authored by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) even as he stood by his longtime claim that it’s “recklessly flawed” because it does not sufficiently protect victims and whistleblowers in his view. He told GOP members in a private conference meeting earlier that morning to vote their “conscience,” according to four people in the room granted anonymity to describe the private meeting.</p> 
<p>“I think it could be a near-unanimous vote,” Johnson said.</p> 
<p>Tuesday’s vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act is the culmination of a monthslong bipartisan effort. Speaking at the news conference, Massie accused Trump of “trying to protect friends and donors” by opposing the legislation for so long. The victims, meanwhile, shared none of Johnson’s concerns that its passage would threaten their well-being.</p> 
<p>Other members of GOP leadership are also signaling they will vote for the bill. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise confirmed his vote in a brief interview Tuesday morning, and Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), the GOP conference chair, issued a statement saying she would also support it.</p> 
<p>Both Johnson and Scalise have suggested the Senate might revise the bill later, but there is likely to be little appetite in the other chamber for prolonged consideration of a measure that most Republicans want to put quickly behind them.</p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune isn't expected to announce what the Senate will do until after the House passes the bill, but there's growing support among Senate Republicans to pass the resolution in the wake of Trump's shift — potentially by unanimous consent this week.</p> 
<p>Johnson and Massie <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/thomas-massie-trump-jeffrey-epstein-00654214" target="_blank">continued to snipe at each other</a>, meanwhile, with the speaker saying Tuesday he got the “middle finger” from the bill sponsors when GOP leaders asked to make revisions, while Massie said in an interview Monday that Johnson’s “concerns were never warranted.”</p> 
<p>“If he actually wanted the Epstein files released, he could have offered his suggestions four months ago and brought it to the floor,” Massie said. “Instead he … spread lies about our legislation he now supports because the president told him to.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior White House official said the Trump administration intends to put forward a health bill and left open the possibility of using the fast-track legislative process of reconciliation for passage of health or tariff legislation.</p> 
<p>“We’re going to have the health care conversation. We’re going to put some legislation forward,” White House deputy chief of staff James Blair said Tuesday at a Bloomberg Government policy breakfast.</p> 
<p>He expressed interest in a bipartisan health plan but said that “if that path is foreclosed, there is the partisan path of reconciliation as well.”</p> 
<p>Such a move would allow Republicans to advance a health plan with a simple majority, a path they unsuccessfully attempted in Trump’s first term to repeal Obamacare but successfully used earlier this year on <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_1" target="_blank">the megabill</a>.</p> 
<p>“The president probably would like to go bigger than the Hill has the appetite for, so we’ll have to see how that, you know, works out,” Blair added, hinting at potential friction between the White House and congressional Republicans.</p> 
<p>Several GOP lawmakers have said privately that they expect the White House to put forward a framework that revisits long-standing Republican goals — including reducing insurance costs, expanding health savings accounts and unwinding parts of the Affordable Care Act — though it remains unclear how sweeping Trump hopes to go.</p> 
<p>If a reconciliation bill moves soon, Blair indicated that the administration would also want to include "probably the Trump tariff dividends and … interest in locking in tariffs."</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans have been privately discussing a second reconciliation package. Budget Committee Republicans are tentatively looking at early next year for finalizing a budget resolution that would tee up the party-line package, according to senators on the committee.</p> 
<p>Senate Budget Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51186" data-person-id="51186">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-S.C.) previously told POLITICO that the party could use a second bill to tackle health care, spending and tax policy.</p> 
<p>But there’s plenty of skepticism, including within top members of the House and Senate GOP conferences, about doing another party-line bill, which would require near unity from their thin majorities. GOP senators, in a recent closed-door lunch, noted that many of their health care ideas left out of the “big, beautiful bill” wouldn’t comply with the Senate’s strict rules for what can be included under reconciliation, according to one attendee granted anonymity to disclose private discussions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two big votes are hitting the House floor Tuesday afternoon, with each party caught between unity and accountability.</p> 
<p><b>ON THE GOP SIDE —</b> The House is expected to easily pass a resolution calling on the DOJ to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein after a monthslong battle by President Donald Trump and GOP leaders to block the vote.</p> 
<p>Trump said Monday he would sign the bill if it lands on his desk, giving political cover for Republicans to vote for the measure. The House will vote under suspension of the rules Tuesday, limiting debate and requiring a two-thirds majority.</p> 
<p>What we’re really watching is the Senate. Last night, Republicans advanced rule language that effectively forces Speaker Mike Johnson to send the bill across the Rotunda. If he doesn’t, the original discharge petition remains in force, triggering another House vote.</p> 
<p>Senate GOP leaders haven’t committed to putting a vote on the floor, but Trump’s new endorsement has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/epstein-files-bill-congress-00655286" target="_blank">changed the dynamic</a>.</p> 
<p>Johnson said he wants the Senate to amend the measure to include more protections for victims and whistleblowers. But that would require another House vote, further extending a saga most Hill Republicans want to move past as quickly as possible.</p> 
<p><b>ON THE DEM SIDE —</b> The House is also expected to vote at Tuesday's 2 p.m. series on a resolution condemning Rep. Chuy García (D-Ill.) for a move in which he retired and <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/03/congress/jesus-chuy-garcia-retirement-watch-00634349" target="_blank">functionally guaranteed</a> his chief of staff would succeed him.</p> 
<p>The resolution, triggered by Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.), forces Democrats to choose between sticking by a longtime colleague and condemning a hardball move many find difficult to stomach.</p> 
<p>García <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/chuy-garcia-house-democrats-split-00655609" target="_blank">defended himself on the floor</a> Monday night, saying he chose to put family first by retiring and suggesting that what goes around might come around: “One day you might be the one making that choice, and you shouldn’t have to debate it on the House floor.”</p> 
<p>But one House Democrat, granted anonymity to speak candidly, estimated to POLITICO that “a not insignificant number of Democrats” will support the disapproval measure after only Gluesenkamp Perez and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) opposed a motion to table Monday. Keep an eye on more moderate Democrats like Nevada Rep. Susie Lee, who told POLITICO “it was questionable, the timing,” while many others in the caucus hold their nose.</p> 
<p>“It’s an unpleasant one,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who said he will vote against it Tuesday. “Chuy García is a friend and a great guy. But I don’t like the optics of this.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p>— <b>ACA latest: </b>House GOP leaders will <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/aca-obamacare-subsidies-extension-00655842" target="_blank">lead a high-level discussion</a> in their conference meeting Tuesday morning on how to address rising health care costs. It comes as Senate Republicans are quickly developing their own legislative proposals and some House Republicans fret they could get jammed by the upper chamber. </p> 
<p><b>— CBO hearing:</b> Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel is set to testify Tuesday morning before the House Budget Committee. The oversight hearing will be the first chance GOP lawmakers have to air their grievances over the agency’s analysis of their party’s megabill since the legislation was enacted in July.</p> 
<p><b>— NDAA crunch time: </b>House and Senate lawmakers have a critical week ahead to reach a compromise on major defense policy legislation if they want to have a deal ready to hit the floor after the Thanksgiving break for an early December vote.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House is on track to rebuke a veteran Illinois lawmaker over a hardball political tactic — a move that has stirred intraparty anger at the fellow Democrat who prompted it.</p> 
<p>The formal admonishment targets Rep. Chuy García, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/03/congress/jesus-chuy-garcia-retirement-watch-00634349" target="_blank">announced his retirement</a> earlier this month only after the candidate qualification period closed — all but assuring his chief of staff would succeed him in the solid blue Chicago district.</p> 
<p>What has roiled Democrats is who forced the issue: Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who introduced the rebuke Wednesday under a fast-track process bypassing House leadership. That she did so as House Democratic leaders moved to focus attention on GOP disarray on health care and the Jeffrey Epstein case has further exacerbated the tensions.</p> 
<p>A vote to kill the disapproval resolution backed by House Democratic leaders failed on a 211-206 vote Monday, with Rep. Jared Golden of Maine being the only other Democrat joining Gluesenkamp Perez to proceed with the symbolic measure. </p> 
<p>That tees up debate and a final vote as soon as Tuesday. Some Democrats granted anonymity to describe private conversations with colleagues said they expected many more defections on that vote.</p> 
<p>“You don't get your cake and eat it, too,” Gluesenkamp Perez said during a debate that followed the vote. “If you are not going to run, you don't choose your successor — no matter the work you have done beforehand.”</p> 
<p>Although some in the party privately disagreed with García's decision to retire after only the filing deadline, many House Democrats bristled at Gluesenkamp Perez’s decision to call it up on a day when the party was attempting to project unity at the end of the record government shutdown.</p> 
<p>Many also cited García’s own response, saying his decision to retire was based on his health and family needs. His office has <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/17/congress/chuy-garcia-talking-points-00654743" target="_blank">forcefully pushed back</a> against any accusations of wrongdoing, blasting out talking points to Capitol Hill offices Monday.</p> 
<p>“There was absolutely nothing illegal or unethical,” said Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.). “This is entirely based on an assumption about what one member believes were his intentions, when in fact, he has clearly stated he needed the time to make up his mind, and he was going through a lot of personal difficulties in his life trying to decide if he was going to run again.”</p> 
<p>García spoke out on his own behalf Monday night after the vote, saying that “our job comes second to the people waiting at home.”</p> 
<p>“When a colleague chooses his family, that shouldn’t be a moment for division — it should be a moment for understanding and unity,” he said. “One day you might be the one making that choice, and you shouldn’t have to debate it on the House floor.”</p> 
<p>But many in Democratic circles have spoken up on Gluesenkamp Perez’s behalf for calling out García for essentially hand-picking his successor, including Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey and veteran Chicago political strategist David Axelrod. Purple-district Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.) said Monday she had “a lot of questions about the timing of what he did.”</p> 
<p>Even those who defended García registered some distaste for how he engineered his departure from the House.</p> 
<p>“I have tremendous sympathy for the family situation that Chuy has. I also think we have a long history [in Illinois] of greasing the skids for successors, which is not a good way for democracy to work,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.). “But I don’t think that this is something that should really warrant the attention of the House.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t think it was a long decision,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), whose own retirement has kicked off a hotly contested primary, of García’s deliberations. “I don’t know if it was as short as it appears, either."</p> 
<p>Yet Democratic leaders firmly backed García, who remains popular with his Democratic colleagues. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which García and Gluesenkamp Perez are both members, released a statement last week “in solidarity with” García. And House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave the 69-year-old his full-throated backing in comments to reporters Monday.</p> 
<p>"He's been a progressive champion in disenfranchised communities for decades, including during his time in Congress, and he's made life better for the American people," Jeffries said, adding that he believed the disapproval measure would be successfully tabled.</p> 
<p>Gluesenkamp Perez, who represents a swing district and belongs to the moderate Blue Dog faction, has a much less cozy relationship with her colleagues. She had a testy confrontation with House Minority Whip Katherine Clark on the House floor after introducing her measure. Clark later told reporters that lawmakers “should be focused on the issue of health care.”</p> 
<p>Gluesenkamp Perez has doubled down on her criticism of her fellow Democrats. In a CNN interview Sunday, she said she understood the desire to have a unified message as a party. But, she added, “When you see things like this … it's not just about having affordable stuff or holding another team accountable, it's that we want leadership. We want a team that calls a spade a spade.”</p> 
<p>It’s not the first time she’s cut against her party. Earlier this year, she unsuccessfully attempted to add congressional <a href="https://gluesenkampperez.house.gov/posts/appropriations-committee-votes-down-gluesenkamp-perezs-cognitive-acuity-amendment" target="_blank">ethics standards relating to cognitive ability</a> to an appropriations bill. And she was one of a half-dozen Democrats who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/house-votes-to-reopen-government-after-43-day-shutdown-00649927" target="_blank">voted with Republicans</a> to pass the funding bill ending the government shutdown.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capitol Hill Republicans are rapidly falling in line behind a bill that would force the disclosure of Justice Department files concerning Jeffrey Epstein after President Donald Trump signaled Monday he would sign it.</p> 
<p>Two prominent House committee chairs said they planned to support the bill compelling the release of materials related to the late convicted sex offender, and GOP leaders are expected to advance the measure under special fast-track rules Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s sudden support for the measure — after a monthslong campaign to kill it — has transformed its prospects in the Senate, where it was long assumed Republicans would simply bottle it up. Now a growing number of GOP senators are open to giving the bill a vote, and some are wondering whether it might simply be sent to Trump’s desk by unanimous consent.</p> 
<p>It’s a remarkable reversal of fortune for the effort to disgorge the “Epstein files,” prompted by a successful bipartisan effort to circumvent Speaker Mike Johnson and force the legislation to the floor.</p> 
<p>Recognizing that House approval of the legislation was all but certain, Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/jeffrey-epstein-vote-house-republicans-00652460" target="_blank">abandoned his efforts to derail the bill</a> in a social media post Sunday night. Asked in the Oval Office on Monday if he would sign it, Trump said, “Sure I would.”</p> 
<p>Some of his closest allies in the House said Monday they were ready to follow the president’s lead.</p> 
<p>House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in an interview Monday afternoon he will vote for the Epstein bill.</p> 
<p>“I think everyone will vote for it,” Jordan said, adding he agreed with Trump that Republicans need “to get this ridiculous thing past us.”</p> 
<p>Asked if he expected any changes to the bill <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/thomas-massie-trump-jeffrey-epstein-00654214" target="_blank">authored by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)</a> before it gets a floor vote, Jordan replied: “No.”</p> 
<p>House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.), whose panel has released thousands of Epstein emails that have heightened scrutiny of Trump’s dealings with the disgraced financier, also said he would vote for the bill. He, too, suggested the vote would not be close.</p> 
<p>“I mean, I think everybody's gonna vote for it,” Comer said in an interview.</p> 
<p>“It’s just a show vote, you know? I mean, we're the ones that have already gotten all the new information from the estate,” he said, touting his own panel’s probe into the matter.</p> 
<p>Comer also questioned the practical impact of the legislation: “I think the Department of Justice has turned over what they're legally allowed to turn over.”</p> 
<p>Trump suggested as much in his Sunday night post telling lawmakers to support the bill, with many Republicans skeptical about how much new information the department would release if the bill passes.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders had been exploring a two-step <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/14/house-epstein-files-vote-00652964" target="_blank">plan to advance the Epstein bill</a> by first adopting a procedural measure in the Rules Committee Monday night that would incorporate a separate procedural measure from Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), setting up a final vote Tuesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>But after meeting with fellow Republican leaders, Johnson said they were instead moving toward a plan that would put the bill up for a vote Tuesday under so-called suspension of the rules, a simpler fast-track procedure requiring a two-thirds majority vote for passage. </p> 
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune isn't currently expected to weigh in on whether he will bring up the Epstein measure until after it passes the House, according to a person granted anonymity to disclose internal strategy.</p> 
<p>But Trump's support for passing the Epstein files resolution has changed the dynamic inside the Senate GOP, where top Republicans have previously downplayed the chances of the chamber acting on the House bill, according to two other people granted anonymity to comment on the sensitive matter.</p> 
<p>A growing number of GOP senators are open to giving the resolution a vote — pointing to both Trump's comments and interest from their own constituents in seeing Congress take action on Epstein.</p> 
<p>"I don't have any problems with data coming out. So lots of people ran on this issue in the last election, so I don't have any problems with us voting on it," Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) told reporters Monday.</p> 
<p>Johnson said he had "some comfort" that the Senate would amend the bill to provide for "the protection of victims and whistleblowers and all the rest” before passing it. That would require another House vote before it moves to Trump's desk.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans will not return to Washington until Tuesday evening, when they are expected to discuss next steps. The only way for the resolution to pass the Senate this week would be with buy-in from every senator to either speed up a vote or skip one altogether with a vote by unanimous consent, which would let it clear the chamber without a roll call vote.</p> 
<p>Congressional passage — and a Trump signature — would not be the end of the Epstein saga on Capitol Hill, however.</p> 
<p>Jordan said he plans to have Attorney General Pam Bondi back before his panel for a rescheduled oversight hearing “as soon as possible.” Questions about the Epstein case are sure to take center stage in any hearing, as they did when Bondi recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/07/congress/pam-bondi-spars-with-dick-durbin-00596234" target="_blank">appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee</a>.</p> 
<p>Lawmakers are also bracing for the possibility that Trump might pardon Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, a possibility Trump has repeatedly declined to rule out .</p> 
<p>Comer responded sharply when asked if he’d support a pardon for Maxwell: “No, I do not,” he said. “I’ve already said that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump's call for House Republicans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/jeffrey-epstein-vote-house-republicans-00652460" target="_blank">support releasing Jeffrey Epstein-related documents</a> was a stunning capitulation after a months-long campaign to block the vote.</p> 
<p>It was also a specific defeat for Trump at the hands of a despised GOP opponent: Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.</p> 
<p>“He got tired of me winning,” Massie said of Trump’s U-turn in an interview Monday morning.</p> 
<p>Insisting “I DON’T CARE!” in a late-night Truth Social post, Trump was bowing to the inevitable — a broad House Republican mutiny on a vote that was only scheduled because Massie forced it. It was the result of Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) launching a discharge petition aimed at sidestepping senior GOP leaders who desperately wanted to avoid bringing the issue to the House floor.</p> 
<p>The campaign to avoid the vote got remarkably ugly in the days before Trump finally conceded, with the president personally attacking Massie for recently remarrying after the sudden death in June 2024 of his wife of more than 30 years. Just hours before Trump’s reversal, one of his top political advisers called him “garbage” in an X post.</p> 
<p>That adviser, Chris LaCivita, is carrying out a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/07/09/thomas-massie-donald-trump-kentucky-libertarian-conservatism-00441983" target="_blank">Trump-ordered effort to unseat Massie</a> from the rural northern Kentucky seat he has held since 2012. Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/21/congress/massies-challenger-00616290" target="_blank">recently endorsed</a> a challenger, former Navy SEAL Ed Gallrein, in the GOP primary.</p> 
<p>Massie has not flinched from the threats. Politically, he has seen the best fundraising of his congressional career, entering October with more than $2 million in his campaign coffers. As for the personal attacks, Massie said Monday he and his wife were laughing them off.</p> 
<p>“She said, ‘I told you we should have invited him to the wedding!’” Massie said.</p> 
<p>Massie’s efforts around Epstein have been no laughing matter for the White House, with top aides and legislative affairs staff furiously scrambling late last week to head off the completion of the discharge petition.</p> 
<p>That included pulling Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) into the White House Situation Room in the final hours to try to persuade her to remove her name from the petition she had signed alongside GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, a survivor of sexual assault. All three have cast their support for the petition as an effort to protect women.</p> 
<p>Trump's pressure campaign failed. The three female House Republicans held firm, and the petition notched its final and 218th signature Wednesday moments after Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) was sworn in following her September special election win. Despite a final barrage of attacks from the president over the weekend — which included Trump calling his once-close ally Greene a “traitor” and threatening a GOP primary against her — backers of the Massie-Khanna discharge effort knew they had the president beat.</p> 
<p>There were emerging signs that it was Massie, not Trump, who had his fingers closer to the pulse of the MAGA base.</p> 
<p>Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), a top Trump ally in the House, posted online he would be “voting NO on the Epstein Hoax” as he sought to rally Republicans to “stand by” the president’s side. Nehls received an immediate barrage of online pushback, suggesting a position against full transparency on Epstein would not be sustainable.</p> 
<p>Massie in conjunction with the three GOP women who signed the discharge petition have sought to put Epstein’s victims front and center amid the battle. They invited several to Capitol Hill in September to keep the fight in the public eye as members returned from the summer recess. They are tentatively scheduled to appear together again Tuesday ahead of the final House vote.</p> 
<p>“This shouldn’t have been a battle, and unfortunately, it has been one,” Greene said as she left a meeting with Epstein victims in September.</p> 
<p>Yet for months, senior White House officials labored to convince rank-and-file Republicans to keep their names off Massie’s discharge effort. That, according to five people granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, included warnings that any effort to support an Epstein vote would be viewed as a direct and personal move against the president.</p> 
<p>Trump has denied wrongdoing in relation to the Epstein allegations, and no evidence has suggested that Trump took part in Epstein’s trafficking operation. The president also has maintained that he and Epstein had a falling out years ago.</p> 
<p>“President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files,” said Abigail Jackson, a deputy White House press secretary, in a statement. “The Democrats knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them until they thought they could weaponize the files against the President.”</p> 
<p>In an effort to undercut Massie's effort, GOP leaders and the Justice Department worked to release 30,000 pages of DOJ documents in early September, right after Massie could begin gathering signatures on his petition. But lawmakers quickly realized most of the materials had been previously released.</p> 
<p>Around that time, the White House’s key legislative affairs liaison to the House, Jeff Freeland, was on the Hill, seeking to head off Massie right after lawmakers returned from recess.</p> 
<p>“Jeff introduced himself to me outside of the Capitol, and he said I was moving too fast for him,” Massie said in the interview. “I told him I made a mistake by getting 12 sponsors [on the Epstein bill], because I had given him his whip list to block the most likely signers” of the discharge petition.</p> 
<p>Over the past week, it became clear to House GOP leaders that they would no longer be able to keep the Epstein measure off the House floor. Shortly after Grijalva signed, Speaker Mike Johnson announced he would expedite the vote, holding it this week rather than next month as required under the discharge petition. Still, with Trump opposing the effort, he maintained Massie’s legislation was reckless and “moot” now that the House Oversight Committee was heading up its own probe.</p> 
<p>Last week, Johnson tried calling one of the three GOP women who had signed on to Massie’s discharge petition. The member looked down at her phone and let the call go to voicemail, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter who declined to identify the specific lawmaker.</p> 
<p>Trump’s Sunday night edict was directed only at House Republicans, according to Trump officials. The president could order the release of the entire Epstein document trove at any time, vote or no vote. So far, he’s declined to do so.</p> 
<p>Senate GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote on the Epstein bill if the House passes it as expected this week. While Republicans still widely assume the measure will die in the other chamber, it will be hard to argue to GOP senators that they should take the political heat while their House counterparts get to take a consequence-free vote.</p> 
<p>Massie has been working with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who authored a Senate version of the bill, to bring the matter to a head across the Rotunda. Senate Democrats are already exploring options to force a vote in the coming weeks.</p> 
<p>Massie said last week that the Epstein drama reflects how Republicans are starting to take stock of a post-Trump political world.</p> 
<p>“They need to look past 2028 and wonder if they want this on their record for the rest of their political career,” he said.</p> 
<p>“Right now, it's OK to cover up for pedophiles, because the president will take up for you if you're in the red districts — that's the deal,” Massie told reporters last week. “But that deal only works as long as he's popular or president. … If they're thinking about the right thing to do, that's pretty obvious: You vote for it.”</p>]]></content:encoded>
