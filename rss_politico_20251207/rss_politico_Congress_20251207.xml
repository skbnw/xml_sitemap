      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just-pardoned Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar is encouraging his Republican colleagues to investigate the prosecutors who charged him and his wife with bribery.</p> 
<p>“I really think what they did was wrong,” Cuellar said in an interview Friday, adding that he has spoken to people in the House who are investigating prosecutors under former President Joe Biden. He said he plans to share information with them about his case.</p> 
<p>Any such probe would represent a remarkable scrambling of partisan battle lines over the Justice Department. But it would be just the latest such jumble involving Cuellar, a self-proclaimed conservative Democrat who was an outlier in his party even before he faced corruption charges — and was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/henry-cuellar-trump-pardon-00674210" target="_blank">suddenly pardoned Wednesday</a> by President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>The investigation Cuellar referred to appears to be an ongoing probe of DOJ "weaponization" led by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).</p> 
<p>Cuellar ran into Jordan shortly after Trump announced the pardon of Cuellar and his wife Wednesday, according to a person granted anonymity to describe the private conversation. Cuellar encouraged Jordan to request records from the Justice Department on his prosecution, and Jordan expressed openness to the idea, the person said.</p> 
<p>“Based on what’s there, I definitely feel that there was misconduct by the prosecutors," Cuellar said Friday. "So we’ll get more in details later on, but I certainly am convinced that this was weaponization.”</p> 
<p>Jordan spokesperson Russell Dye declined to comment.</p> 
<p>Cuellar and his wife were <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/03/congress/cuellar-indicted-00155977" target="_blank">charged in 2024 with accepting $600,000 in bribes</a> from foreign entities, including an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan. Cuellar has said he and his wife were innocent of the charges.</p> 
<p>In the Truth Social post announcing the pardon Wednesday, Trump blamed Biden for using “the FBI and DOJ to ‘take out’ a member of his own party” after Cuellar criticized Biden’s immigration policies.</p> 
<p>Jordan has spearheaded investigations of Biden-era probes of Trump, leading a select subcommittee on the "Weaponization of the Federal Government." He has recently ramped up the efforts, most recently subpoenaing former special counsel Jack Smith and accusing Smith’s team of<b>&nbsp;</b>"prosecutorial misconduct and constitutional abuses" in their investigations of Trump.</p> 
<p>Cuellar reiterated in the interview that despite his criticism for his own party and his willingness to cooperate with a polarizing GOP probe, he has no plans to switch parties. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/henry-cuellar-pardon-reelection-party-00674518" target="_blank">filed for reelection as a Democrat</a> soon after he was pardoned Wednesday.</p> 
<p>"I was a Democrat, and I'm still a Democrat," he said.</p> 
<p>Cuellar also said in the interview that neither he nor his family members had hired representatives to speak to the White House on his behalf — even as former lawyers and advisers to Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/25/binance-zhao-pardon-lobby-00621788" target="_blank">have reported receiving significant sums to seek pardons</a> on behalf of accused and convicted criminals. </p> 
<p>Trump in Wednesday's Truth Social post included a letter Cuellar's daughters wrote to the president criticizing the prosecution as politically motivated and pleading for clemency.</p> 
<p>Cuellar said he found out about the pardon Wednesday when asked by a reporter about Trump’s announcement.</p> 
<p>“My daughters ... saw their mom and dad go through a very difficult time and, on their own, they wrote a letter to the president,” he said. “Apparently the president read it and made a decision.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INDIANAPOLIS — Republicans scored a major win in the redistricting fight when the Supreme Court reinstated Texas’ newly drawn congressional map on Thursday. But President Donald Trump and his allies are staring down a brewing rebellion in the Indiana Statehouse that could derail their momentum.</p> 
<p>The high court decided in an apparent 6-3 vote to block <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/supreme-court-texas-house-map-00678075" target="_blank">a lower court ruling that deemed the Texas map a likely illegal race-based gerrymander</a>. In doing so, the court’s conservative majority helped Republicans avert a nightmare scenario in which Trump’s redistricting push ultimately cost the party seats leading into the 2026 midterms.</p> 
<p>The focus now shifts to Indianapolis, where the president’s allies are heaping pressure on GOP holdouts in the state Senate who are resisting Trump’s demands to draw new lines there that could net Republicans additional congressional seats.</p> 
<p>In the state Capitol, as members of the state House debated final passage of a map supporters argue would all but guarantee an entirely Republican congressional delegation — from the current 7-2 split favoring the GOP — Turning Point USA held a sparsely attended rally to pressure Indiana Senate Republicans to do the same, over chants of “9-0.”</p> 
<p>“This is now the national make-or-break issue of the year,” said Brett Galaszewski of Turning Point Action, adding that Indiana “is the center of the political universe.” Gov. Mike Braun and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith both addressed the crowd as they faced cheers, boos and shouts of “cheaters” from counterprotesters.</p> 
<p>Earlier Friday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/05/trump-allied-pacs-target-indiana-republicans-blocking-redistricting-push-00678520" target="_blank">Turning Point Action announced</a> that it, along with Trump-aligned super PACs, would spend in excess of eight figures to primary Indiana Republicans through 2028 if they opposed the new map. And Club for Growth President David McIntosh issued a “FINAL WARNING” to Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, writing, “failure to get this done means you and any other opposition will be defeated and removed from office in your next election.”</p> 
<p>All of it was designed to amp up pressure on reluctant Indiana Senate Republicans, who are expected to convene Monday to consider the new map. It’s unclear whether pro-redistricting allies have flipped any senators since they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/redistricting-indiana-resistance-00663698" target="_blank">stalemated 19-19</a>last month on a vote that was a close proxy for gerrymandering. The map passed the state House easily on Friday.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/ef/39/6e172f8043fe87923f14288b92a3/img-1417.jpg" alt="The fight over the new lines across the country is expected to carry into the new year." data-portal-copyright="Adam Wren/POLITICO" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="The fight over the new lines across the country is expected to carry into the new year."/><p>For now, Republicans have an edge across the six states that have seen a redraw. The GOP has nine more favorable seats across four states — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/23/texas-passes-congressional-map-gerrymander-00519116" target="_blank">Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/ohio-redistricting-gerrymander-new-map-00631254" target="_blank">Ohio</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/12/missouri-map-redistricting-midterms-00557990" target="_blank">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/north-carolina-new-house-district-gop-gerrymander-00618225" target="_blank">North Carolina</a> — while Democrats have five more blue-leaning <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/prop50-newsom-strategy-00630313" target="_blank">seats in California</a>, and an additional <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/utah-judge-denies-gop-passed-congressional-map-00646183?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack" target="_blank">court-ordered likely pickup in Utah</a>.</p> 
<p>The fight over the new lines across the country is expected to carry into the new year. Privately, Democrats were not shocked by the Texas ruling, long assuming the conservative Supreme Court was going to allow the Texas map to stand. With the Texas maps in place, Democrats involved in the nationwide battle anticipate they'll ultimately start the midterm cycle down a handful of seats, but the exact number isn't clear.</p> 
<p>Republicans see another key pickup opportunity in Florida, where party redistricting proponents think they could extract another three to five seats ahead of the midterm elections.</p> 
<p>But while the state Legislature officially kicked off the mid-decade battle in the state on Thursday, Gov. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/florida-house-barrels-ahead-on-redistricting-despite-desantis-proposed-timeline-00677841" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis and the Florida House lawmaker in charge of redistricting</a> are at odds over how quickly to do it. And the state’s prospective redraw faces another roadblock: Florida’s anti-gerrymandering standards, which hold that a new district cannot be drawn for partisan gain.</p> 
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, are homing in on Virginia. Five of the state’s 11 House seats are held by Republicans, who were trounced in a November election that bestowed on Virginia a Democratic governor, attorney general and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/virginia-house-of-delegates-winner-00636533" target="_blank">a big Statehouse majority</a>. Democrats there already kicked off <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/23/virginia-house-redistricting-democrats-00620430" target="_blank">a surprise redraw process</a> right before the election. Now, Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott is teasing a major redraw early next year.</p> 
<p>"10-1 is not out of the realm to be able to draw the maps in a succinct and community-based way," <a href="https://x.com/kkondik/status/1996315465702867116" target="_blank">he said this week</a>. “We’re gonna take a look at it. We have to.”</p> 
<p>In Missouri, Democrats are looking to challenge a map the GOP-controlled Legislature passed in September, leaving the state with just one blue district. They <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/missouri-redistricting-gerrymander-fight-00675360" target="_blank">face a Thursday deadline to submit over 100,000 signatures</a> that could trigger a referendum and temporarily block the new lines from being implemented, along with a complicated web of legal battles around the referendum process.</p> 
<p>The Department of Justice, meanwhile, is going ahead with its lawsuit to challenge California’s new congressional map, even after Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1996729831355044296" target="_blank">celebrated the Supreme Court’s decision</a> to greenlight Texas’ newly gerrymandered House map.</p> 
<p>But the high court’s blessing of Texas’ Republican-friendly redrawn map came with a few Easter eggs that suggested how some of the other percolating redistricting battles are likely to play out. Most notably, three of the court’s conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — concluded that California’s redrawn districts were “indisputably” crafted for partisan advantage.</p> 
<p>It’s unclear precisely how the justices’ decision will influence the broader national clash over mid-decade redistricting for 2026. Had the justices struck down Texas’ map, it may have increased pressure on other GOP-led states like Indiana and Florida to redraw their own boundaries to help give the party a better chance at retaining the House. On the other hand, the ruling’s clear blessing of mid-decade redistricting for partisan gain could ensure that it becomes a routine weapon in the arsenal of political warfare.</p> 
<p>But conservative justices’ signaling on California’s map bodes poorly for the Trump administration, with the DOJ and California Gov. Gavin Newsom trading barbs following the decision.</p> 
<p>“So you gonna drop your lawsuit against us right, Pam?” <a href="https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1996743357893415087" target="_blank">Newsom’s office asked on X Thursday night</a>.</p> 
<p>“Not a chance, Gavin — we will stop your DEI districts for 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/TheJusticeDept/status/1996763717393055933" target="_blank">the Justice Department wrote</a> back.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Republicans spent this week venting about <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, questioning the speaker’s hold on his tenuous House majority. Next week, he has to prove he’s capable of governing.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_3838" target="_blank">annual Pentagon policy bill</a> is due on the floor just in time to test Johnson’s ability to command and cajole his conference with must-pass legislation at stake. Already GOP leaders have had to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/03/ndaa-delays-defense-bill-00676098" target="_blank">delay release of bill text</a> as they deal with a host of 11th-hour intraparty flare-ups that show just how hard it will be for the speaker to lead ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p> 
<p>Johnson is already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-feud-00674030" target="_blank">bruised from a high-profile fight</a> with Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227481" data-person-id="227481">Elise Stefanik</a> (R-N.Y.), a member of the GOP leadership team, over a surveillance provision she wanted attached to the sprawling defense package. She got her way after publicly accusing the speaker of lying and sandbagging conservatives.</p> 
<p>Other deeply divisive issues remain, ranging from cryptocurrency policy to in vitro fertilization, that could threaten to further splinter the House GOP and imperil the typically <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_DRAFT20" target="_blank">bipartisan Pentagon bill</a>. The brouhaha threatens to complicate Johnson’s effort to hammer out a still-brewing Republican health care plan he’s promised to unveil by early next week.</p> 
<p>“I think there's a lot of members that are frustrated that we're not doing the things that we said that we were going to do,” said Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/189831" data-person-id="189831">Greg Steube</a> (R-Fla.) when asked about Johnson’s leadership. “His response to that would be, we only have a [three] vote majority, but I think if you govern conservatively, Republicans will show up and vote for it.”</p> 
<p>Steube, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was “not happy” that Johnson initially excluded Stefanik’s legislation allowing for congressional notification of counterintelligence probes concerning candidates for federal office — part of an annual intelligence authorization legislation that, he said, included “a lot of conservative reforms.” The speaker argued he didn’t know about the measure and that Stefanik’s accusations were “false.”</p> 
<p>Top GOP leaders are scrambling to douse the remaining fires and release text of the massive bill as early as Saturday, but it could slip into Sunday, according to four people granted anonymity to comment on internal planning. The negotiations are complicated, they say, because the final product must not only pass the GOP-controlled House but also withstand a possible Senate filibuster — meaning it needs to have Democratic buy-in.</p> 
<p>“Getting an agreement right now between Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate's not easy,” Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a> said. “But we're getting close, and we want to get it done.”</p> 
<p>Johnson played down the internal turmoil Thursday, saying Republicans “are exactly on the trajectory of where we've always planned to be.”</p> 
<p>“Steady at the wheel, everybody,” he said. “It’s going to be fine.”</p> 
<p>But the pending fights over the Pentagon bill — or the National Defense Authorization Act, as it is formally known — serve as a mini-preview for the turmoil Johnson is likely to face for the remainder of the 119th Congress as he tries to tackle health care, government funding and other flashpoints.</p> 
<p>For instance, he is risking a showdown with conservative hard-liners if the final package doesn’t include a provision they favor that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital currency. Johnson <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/16/congress/house-advances-crypto-defense-spending-bills-following-standoff-00459201" target="_blank">promised House Freedom Caucus members</a> he would include the provision in the defense bill amid a toxic intra-GOP row during the House’s shambolic “crypto week” this summer.</p> 
<p>If the so-called central bank digital currency ban is missing, “it is a big deal,” said one House conservative who, like others quoted for this story, was granted anonymity to speak frankly about conference dynamics.</p> 
<p>The fate of that provision is currently tied up in talks over another matter — one that highlights how Johnson is facing pressure from another influential corner of the House GOP: his committee chairs.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders are taking steps to add a scaled-down version of a Senate housing proposal to the package. But Financial Services Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227472" data-person-id="227472">French Hill</a> (R-Ark.) opposes the move and wants to advance a slate of House housing bills through his committee later this month.</p> 
<p>Johnson and Hill, normally low-key operators, had an intense conversation on the House floor Wednesday night as House and Senate GOP leaders went back-and-forth, including at the White House’s behest, over how to add some housing affordability measures to the defense bill.</p> 
<p>“French is very logical and measured, but he's very stern in what he believes and what he wants,” said a senior House Republican.</p> 
<p>Johnson, a staunch social conservative, is also facing pressure from women and others in the House to not strip out a measure expanding coverage for in vitro fertilization and other fertility services for military families under DOD’s Tricare health system. He’s also caught between big business and China hawks — two major GOP blocs — on whether to add in new restrictions on U.S. investments in China. Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192213" data-person-id="192213">John Moolenaar</a> (R-Mich.), who chairs a select committee on China, said he was hopeful the provision would make it in but pointed to opposition from the “financial community.”</p> 
<p>The NDAA is “a train that comes around once a year,” he added. “We're hoping to include it.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump on Thursday endorsed Trever Nehls, the identical twin of retiring GOP Rep. Troy Nehls, to fill the Texas seat being vacated by his brother.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115662373086221699" target="_blank">post on Truth Social</a>, Trump lauded Troy Nehls for his congressional career, which he spent as a reliable MAGA ally, and praised his brother for his support of the military, veterans and “LAW AND ORDER,” commending their entire family as “fierce advocates” for the MAGA movement.</p> 
<p>“In Congress, Trever will work hard to Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Grow our Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Advance American Energy DOMINANCE, Champion Election Integrity, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,” he wrote in the post.</p> 
<p>The retiring Nehls has demonstrated <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/22/trump-honors-still-in-office-republican-bills-00244107" target="_blank">staunch loyalty</a> to the president throughout his time in Congress, and the endorsement adds early momentum to his brother’s bid for the seat.</p> 
<p>The lawmaker <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/29/texas-lawmaker-nehls-00670795?experience_id=EXYF89KVT5UQ&amp;is_login_link=true&amp;template_id=OTJIR2CRKUD6&amp;variant_id=OTV632IE7RALS" target="_blank">announced last week</a> that he’d be retiring from Congress at the end of his third term representing a southwestern swath of Houston. The departure dealt <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/texas-house-republicans-power-fading-00676389" target="_blank">yet another blow</a> to Texas’ GOP congressional delegation after five other members announced their retirements. Republicans are banking on the state’s redistricting plan to shore up their majority with another five red seats.</p> 
<p>Shortly after Troy Nehls announced his retirement, his brother announced on social media that he’d be stepping up to the plate to succeed him.</p> 
<p>“District 22 needs a Representative who will follow in Troy’s footsteps and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump to defend our conservative values, secure the border, protect our families, and oppose the reckless and radical agenda that Democrats continue to press upon the American people,” he wrote. “I’m ready to take up that fight.”</p> 
<p>This isn’t the first time he has followed in his brother’s footsteps. Trever Nehls also succeeded his twin as constable of Fort Bend County in 2013. He later won the Republican nomination to succeed him as the county’s sheriff in 2020 but later lost by 5 points in the general election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Democrats blocked Republicans from successfully taking an initial step toward confirming a <a href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=6931de041765462b59f5a053&amp;Domain=politico.com&amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;Lang=en&amp;Base64Url=eNo1yEEKgDAMBMAXtWsFD_obldAWSiJmtT5fL96GKeThC9B7j7tpPsU9Zrux1daQ0swS_oeLrpTw2drFaoppHEB5-AK0Nhow&amp;@OriginalLink=www.congress.gov" target="_blank"><u>package of more than 80 nominations</u></a> because one of the picks doesn't qualify to be included: Sara Bailey's nomination to be the director of national drug control policy is a senior-level pick requiring individual consideration under the new rules <a href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=6931de041765462b59f5a053&amp;Domain=politico.com&amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;Lang=en&amp;Base64Url=eNoNyUkOgCAMAMAXlSJKXH5DsEESpISCfF8Oc5qntSIX4hhDFU6xRc_K84spfgS93K6RoNHGoj5xWdBzDpVEUCjPg8BlIoHcfSJXwQUXM2ht7bGv2w96OyDz&amp;@OriginalLink=www.politico.com" target="_blank"><u>Republicans themselves drafted earlier this year</u></a> for multinominee confirmation votes.</p> 
<p>Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who challenged whether the package could get passed with a simple majority if Bailey’s nomination stayed included, said in a statement that “I just blocked 88 Trump nominees from confirmation.”</p> 
<p>He added, “I will not allow unqualified nominees, this White House, or the President to undermine the rule of law and our national security.”</p> 
<p>Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-eb39-d516-affe-fffd152d0000" target="_blank"><u>re-filed the resolution Thursday afternoon</u></a> with additional nominees, bringing the list to 97 nominations and teeing up a vote next week.

<p>A Senate GOP aide, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said that the additional nominees will put the Senate on track to confirm 420 nominees. </p> 
<p>“Until Senator Bennet spoke up, we were on track to confirm less than 410. Our sincere thank you to master strategist Michael Bennet," the GOP aide added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mike Johnson races to finalize elusive GOP health care plan</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> is racing to finalize a Republican health care plan in time to present it to his conference at their weekly meeting Tuesday, but his team still needs to decide on major contours of the plan, according to three people granted anonymity to describe internal conversations.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders are meeting Thursday to nail down what will go in the package, according to the three people. One major decision still to be made is whether to offer multiple individual bills for floor consideration or to assemble them into one piece of legislation. But top Republicans want to have a GOP alternative to vote on as Democrats hammer them over expiring Obamacare subsidies that will spike premiums for millions of Americans in the new year. </p> 
<p>If Johnson and fellow GOP leaders don’t make decisions about the way forward Thursday, one senior House Republican said, “it’s going to be bad.”</p> 
<p>The package is likely to be an assemblage of various GOP bills that have been working through House committees that are largely aimed at providing more options for health care coverage outside of the Affordable Care Act framework. One likely to be included would provide for "association health plans" allowing smaller businesses to join together to offer plans rather than going through ACA exchanges. Leaders are also likely to include options for expanding the use of health savings accounts, something President Donald Trump has endorsed but Democrats have generally opposed.</p> 
<p>It's also likely to include bipartisan legislation overhauling the role of pharmacy benefit managers and potentially other bills that could lower prescription drug prices — something Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/tony-fabrizio-health-drug-prices-00674841" target="_blank">advised a group of House Republicans</a> to focus on as Democrats seize on the expiring tax credits.</p> 
<p>Johnson said in a brief interview that he and leaders plan to walk House Republicans through the health care plan through this weekend and then circulate the framework early next week. He also confirmed what GOP leaders have said in private — they want to vote on a health care package before the end of the year. But House Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a>, who had been coordinating the health care deliberations, wouldn’t commit to that timeline shortly after Johnson spoke.</p> 
<p>Party leaders are facing massive pressure from GOP centrists who are assembling their own compromise plans to extend the expiring subsides with new eligibility requirements. But Johnson, Scalise and many House Republicans have no interest in continuing with the Obamacare framework.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.), who coauthored a new plan that would provide a one-year extension of the subsidies that has been endorsed by more than two dozen members in both parties, said "we need to act on this issue." </p> 
<p>"To do nothing is the wrong answer," she said.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/254452" data-person-id="254452">Brian Fitzpatrick </a>(R-Pa.), who is assembling a separate compromise bill that would include a longer subsidy extension, said his party's leaders were not going down a path that will prevent a spike in American's health care costs.</p> 
<p>“Is it a Republican-only solution? That’s not a serious solution," he said. "The million-dollar question is, is it bipartisan or not?”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer officially unveiled Democrats’ plan for a health care vote next week, saying Thursday on the chamber floor his caucus will propose extending soon-to-expire Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.</p> 
<p>“This is the bill, a clean three-year extension of ACA tax credits, that Democrats will bring to the floor of the Senate for a vote next Thursday, and every single Democrat will support it," Schumer said. "Republicans have one week to decide where they stand."</p> 
<p>The strategy aligns Senate Democrats with their counterparts in the House — and gives the party a message with which to hammer Republicans heading into next year's midterms. </p> 
<p>But the Democratic bill is guaranteed to fail. While many GOP senators say they would back a two-year extension, they’ve said income caps and other new restrictions would need to be added in order to garner sufficient Republican support.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans are still mulling whether or not to put up a counterproposal on health care for a vote next week. They are likely to discuss the issue during their closed-door lunch Thursday afternoon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Capitol agenda: Texas’ massive delegation is losing its sway</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday could determine whether the Lone Star State gets five more Republican-leaning seats next Congress. Yet the state’s Texas-sized influence is beginning to wane.</p> 
<p>The Texas GOP delegation is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/04/texas-house-republicans-power-fading-00676389" target="_blank">losing its clout</a> due to a combination of redistricting, retirements and bids for higher office.</p> 
<p>The group is on track to lose the seniority and committee gavels it once wielded to influence key decisions in the House. With six retirements looming and another five new GOP-leaning seats in the proposed map — the Supreme Court could decide as soon as Thursday whether to approve it — the state is looking at potentially 11 new members in a 30-member delegation.</p> 
<p>“There’s going to be a lot of introductory lunches, that’s for sure,” Rep. Jake Ellzey (R-Texas) told POLITICO, noting it’s going to be a “drastic change.”</p> 
<p>For decades, the GOP delegation was known for guarding its influence, holding weekly lunches to strategize, amassing seats on the influential steering committee that determines committee assignments and often voting as a bloc on key matters.</p> 
<p>But the fact that President Donald Trump started his aggressive redistricting campaign with Texas — and that it proceeded at all — reflects the state’s relative impotence in Trump’s Washington. Republicans wary of the effort eventually folded under pressure from the president, and since then, a fifth of the delegation has announced plans to leave.</p> 
<p>Those retirements include Budget Chair Jodey Arrington and Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on two key committees for over a decade. At the start of Trump’s first term, Texas had seven gavels, including influential Armed Services, Financial Services and Ways and Means panels and three coveted Appropriations subcommittee chairs. Now, Texans hold only three committee gavels — including Arrington — and no Texans serve in the House GOP’s elected leadership.</p> 
<p>“We were powerful,” said Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), who chairs the House Small Business Committee, recounting what the delegation was like when he first arrived in 2013. “But that all cycles.”</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Van Epps seated: </b>Speaker Mike Johnson will swear in Rep.-elect Matt Van Epps (R-Tenn.) on the House floor at 9 a.m., giving the GOP a 220-213 majority.</p> 
<p><b>— Health care talks: </b>Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) plan to introduce a new framework at 9:30 a.m. to reduce health premiums as lawmakers scramble to figure out what to do about expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. It includes a one-year extension of the subsidies with new guardrails to crack down on fraud and a menu of separate pay-for options — not in the form of subsidies — to keep premiums low.</p> 
<p>Senate Democrats are expected to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/senate-democrats-obamacare-extension-00676149" target="_blank">propose a three-year extension</a> of the subsidies, which Senate Majority Leader John Thune said was “designed to fail.”</p> 
<p><b>— NDAA hurdles: </b>Final legislative text on the annual defense authorization bill was originally expected Thursday but has been delayed as GOP leaders work through <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/03/ndaa-delays-defense-bill-00676098" target="_blank">eleventh-hour intraparty issues</a> that could put its passage in jeopardy. Leaders are now aiming to unveil bill text by the end of the weekend.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Lone Star State is used to having a Texas-sized impact on the House Republican Conference. And, by the numbers, its influence should be larger than ever.</p> 
<p>If a bold redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump goes forward, Texas could have a massive 30-member GOP delegation come 2027. And yet by the measures of clout and seniority — the real markers of power inside the House — the state is clearly on the wane.</p> 
<p>Six members are retiring — some to pursue other political ambitions, others quitting cold turkey. Assuming the redistricting plan is approved — a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/supreme-court-texas-redistricting-case-00659035" target="_blank">Supreme Court ruling on the matter</a> could come as soon as Thursday — another five Republicans would be freshman back-benchers from a state that once racked up committee gavels.</p> 
<p>The turnover has left many in the already huge delegation unsettled and wondering how the state’s clout declined so precipitously. Rep. Pete Sessions, Texas’ longest-serving Republican, said in an interview that it’s “the biggest change of any redistricting period” he has been through in a nearly 30-year career.</p> 
<p>“The timing of this across the board has been difficult to get your hands around,” Sessions said. He noted the redistricting and other retirements will “add youth and opportunity to the Texas delegation but a lot of the inexperience and a lot of things that come at a time when my party needs a lot of teamwork and collegiality.”</p> 
<p>A younger colleague, Rep. Jake Ellzey, also said the delegation is facing a “drastic change” over the coming years: “There's going to be a lot of introductory lunches, that's for sure.”</p> 
<p>Already there has been a remarkable shift since the beginning of Trump’s first term, when Texans held sway over seven House committees — including the powerful Armed Services, Financial Services and Ways and Means panels — as well as three coveted Appropriations subcommittee chairs.</p> 
<p>The GOP delegation was known for zealously guarding its influence, holding weekly lunches to strategize, amassing seats on the influential steering committee that doles out committee assignments and often <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/24/texas-republicans-house-speaker-740361" target="_blank">voting as a bloc</a> on key matters.</p> 
<p>Today Texans hold only three committee gavels, all on relatively backwater panels, and just one Appropriations subcommittee chair. One of those chairs, Budget’s Jodey Arrington, is retiring. No Texans serve in the House GOP’s elected leadership.</p> 
<p>“We were powerful,” said Rep. Roger Williams, who chairs the House Small Business Committee, recounting what the delegation was like when he first arrived in 2013. “But that all cycles.”</p> 
<p>No single member approaches the influence of the most formidable Texan in recent House Republican history — former Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who was often said to be more powerful than the speaker he served with, Dennis Hastert.</p> 
<p>Rep. Michael McCaul, who announced his retirement plans in September, was the top Republican on two key committees for 12 years. In an interview, he remembered DeLay brokering power when he was first elected. “And there was a time when I was one of seven committee chairs from Texas, and we had the majority of the chairmanships,” McCaul added.</p> 
<p>There are still some pockets of ambition in the delegation’s ranks, including Rep. August Pfluger, who heads the 180-plus-member Republican Study Committee. Many Republicans expect Pfluger to vie for an elected leadership role in the next Congress.</p> 
<p>But the fact that the redistricting push proceeded at all reflects the state’s relative impotence in Trump’s Washington. The president used Texas as the tip of the spear in his aggressive campaign to rewrite congressional districts midway through the usual Census-driven cycle, and wary Republicans folded in the face of an unrelenting pressure campaign from Trump’s top political advisers.</p> 
<p>One Texas Republican relayed his surprise and frustration to a group of fellow House Republicans on the floor as the push unfolded.</p> 
<p>“What the hell did we do to deserve this?” he said, according to one of the Republicans present.</p> 
<p>Since then, a fifth of the delegation has announced plans to leave. McCaul <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/14/mccaul-texas-reelection-retire-challenge-term-00563169" target="_blank">announced his plans</a> to retire in September, as did Rep. <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/11/congress/morgan-luttrell-texas-retire-00557843" target="_blank">Morgan Luttrell</a>, a highly recruited former Navy SEAL. Arrington followed, and Rep. Chip Roy launched a campaign for state attorney general, while Rep. Wesley Hunt <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/06/wesley-hunt-texas-2026-senate-republican-primary-00594621" target="_blank">decided to take on</a> incumbent GOP Sen. John Cornyn.</p> 
<p>Last week, Rep. Troy Nehls made a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/29/texas-lawmaker-nehls-00670795?experience_id=EXYF89KVT5UQ&amp;is_login_link=true&amp;template_id=OTJIR2CRKUD6&amp;variant_id=OTV632IE7RALS" target="_blank">surprise announcement</a> that he would be retiring, and some Texas Republicans believe there could be at least one more in their ranks who could call it quits before the state’s Dec. 8 ballot qualifying deadline.</p> 
<p>Rep. Ronny Jackson, Trump’s former White House doctor, has spoken privately to other Republicans in the past about leaving for a possible administration job, but he has filed for reelection. A spokesperson said Jackson is "committed to strengthening the House Republican majority and supporting President Trump’s agenda in Congress."</p> 
<p>Even the Texas Republicans who are sticking around are showing signs of frustration in the House rank-and-file. Some conservatives in the ranks are privately expressing unease about the millions of Texans set to get hammered with higher health care costs before next year’s midterms and are concerned about Republicans’ lack of a counterattack as they get hammered by Democrats.</p> 
<p>Rep. Nathaniel Moran, who represents a deep-red east Texas district, stood up during a recent closed-door GOP conference meeting to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/house-gop-leaders-pitch-members-on-unaffordable-care-act-00656362" target="_blank">confront party leaders</a> on why they haven’t been working on a plan to address expiring Obamacare tax credits until just weeks before the year-end deadline.</p> 
<p>Moran said in an interview this week that Democrats were making headway against the GOP with what he called a “sound bite policy” on health care. “So I would like to see … Republicans come to the forefront” with more substantial plans, he said.</p> 
<p>Other senior Republicans note that the cohesion of the big delegations including Texas’ has withered under speakers Kevin McCarthy and now Mike Johnson, who have continued a trend of centralizing decisionmaking in the leadership suites. Younger members are not given enough senior mentorship, according to another senior Republican, and White House officials “run wild” across the Capitol forcing members to march in lockstep with Trump.</p> 
<p>For more than four decades, the Texas delegation has scheduled regular Thursday lunches in the Capitol during session weeks to build camaraderie and discuss strategy. But because Johnson often aims to wrap up House business by 10:30 a.m. Thursdays, Republicans note, members are often scattered to catch flights by lunchtime — including younger members who are most eager to get home.</p> 
<p>“Certainly that change of schedule has thrown into play the integrity of the ability of a delegation to meet and speak and gather their balance and equilibrium,” Sessions said.</p> 
<p>Members are generally shrugging off the retirements. Moran said “it's a natural cycle” to life in Congress while Arrington said in an interview that “Texans are more inclined to see it as a temporary calling to serve temporarily and go home.”</p> 
<p>“For some people, that's six years. For some, it's eight years, and for others, it's 10,” said Arrington, who is leaving after eight years even though he has the chance to continue at least one additional term as Budget chair if Republicans keep the majority.</p> 
<p>Those who choose to leave have different perspectives on the experience. Nehls and Luttrell have identical twins. Nehls is behind his brother Trever’s bid to replace him in the House, but Luttrell said he didn’t expect his twin brother Marcus, also a retired SEAL, to do the same.</p> 
<p>Asked if he would encourage him to consider it, Luttrell laughed: “No, I would never do that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Senate Democrats eye vote on 3-year Obamacare subsidy extension</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats will propose a three-year extension of soon-to-expire Affordable Care Act subsidies for an expected floor vote next week, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss caucus strategy.</p> 
<p>Democrats get to decide what proposal the Senate votes on as part of a deal struck with Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51242" data-person-id="51242">John Thune</a> last month to end the government shutdown. The Senate is expected to hold that vote Dec. 11.</p> 
<p>The strategy likely helps Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51231" data-person-id="51231">Chuck Schumer</a> keep his caucus unified on the vote, and it aligns his caucus with House Democrats' plan to try to force a vote on a three-year extension through a discharge petition.</p> 
<p>But it will also limit any chance they would be able to peel off more than a couple of Republicans. Thune said in an interview Wednesday that pitching a clean three-year extension is “designed to fail.”</p> 
<p>To get a deal on the subsidies through the Senate, it would need 60 votes to advance. Some GOP senators, including <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51168" data-person-id="51168">Susan Collins</a> of Maine, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51218" data-person-id="51218">Lisa Murkowski</a> of Alaska and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/192907" data-person-id="192907">Thom Tillis</a> of North Carolina, have backed a two-year extension but have acknowledged there would need to be income caps and other restrictions to pick up more GOP support. Whether or not to include abortion funding restrictions is also a major sticking point.</p> 
<p>Spokespeople for Schumer didn’t immediately respond to a question about the plan. Schumer declined to tip his hand earlier Wednesday when asked after a meeting with House Minority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/196306" data-person-id="196306">Hakeem Jeffries</a> if Senate Democrats would offer a three-year extension.</p> 
<p>“Stay tuned,” he told reporters.</p> 
<p>Some of his members want Democrats to put up a more sweeping health care proposal, while others have been discussing a potential compromise with Republicans that would extend the subsidies but with new restrictions.</p> 
<p>Senate Republicans need to decide whether they will offer their own counterproposal for a vote next week. Senate Finance Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51173" data-person-id="51173">Mike Crapo</a> and Senate HELP Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66858" data-person-id="66858">Bill Cassidy</a> talked through their ideas, along with other GOP senators, at a closed-door Tuesday lunch.</p> 
<p>Thune on Wednesday evening said they had not yet made a “final decision” on whether they would put a proposal up for a vote next week.</p> 
<p>“We’ll kind of see what the temperature of our members is,” Thune said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House is backing an effort to attach most of a Senate-approved housing package to a must-pass <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_DRAFT20" target="_blank">annual defense bill</a>, according to three people with knowledge of the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss private talks.</p> 
<p>The administration’s support could breathe new life into the push to include the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_2651?q=road+to+housing" target="_blank">ROAD to Housing</a> package in the National Defense Authorization Act at the eleventh hour. Both Senate leaders are also backing the push, the people said.</p> 
<p>A White House official who was granted anonymity to relay the administration's position said: "We’re open to seeing this moving forward."</p> 
<p>The ROAD package, backed by Senate Banking Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/151800" data-person-id="151800">Tim Scott</a> (R-S.C.) and ranking member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/140963" data-person-id="140963">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.), includes an array of legislation aimed at boosting housing supply. The Banking panel approved the measure unanimously in July.</p> 
<p>Scott and Warren have pushed to include most of the package in the NDAA, but House Financial Services Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227472" data-person-id="227472">French Hill</a> (R-Ark.) has pushed back. Hill said in a statement that “any housing package must have the buy-in from the House Financial Services Committee.”</p> 
<p>“Given our Conference has not seen any text, it’s unclear how we could support its inclusion in the NDAA,” he said.</p> 
<p>Hill spoke on the House floor with Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> (R-La.) Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>Congressional GOP leaders are now considering whether to add a revised or scaled-down version of the Senate’s legislation to the Pentagon bill, but no final decisions have been made, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.</p> 
<p>House Financial Services ranking member <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51664" data-person-id="51664">Maxine Waters</a> (D-Calif.) expressed support for the ROAD package during a committee hearing Wednesday morning, calling it a “common-sense legislative package that would chip away at the [housing] crisis.” But she told reporters later in the day that she doesn’t “know what’s in” the latest proposal.</p> 
<p>“I’m supportive of absolutely getting all of my people on the ROAD bill — their bills into the NDAA package,” she said, referring to the fact that many of the measures in the Senate's housing bill have companion bills in the House. “If they have worked that out, I’m happy. But I want to know what it is. And I want to know how many of my members are covered.”</p> 
<p>House Financial Services has not seen the latest text reflecting what the White House supports, according to a House Democratic aide with knowledge of the matter.</p> 
<p>Trump officials and the president's top political aides are trying to push harder on housing policy, as high home costs and mortgages weigh on voters.</p> 
<p>Top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio spoke extensively about housing policy as a key area of potential focus for Republicans during a closed-door briefing with the Republican Study Committee Wednesday.</p> 
<p>The RSC itself is pushing housing as a key focus for a potential party-line bill the GOP could pass ahead of the midterms. Notably, Fabrizio encouraged House Republicans to work on advancing so-called portable mortgages, an idea some Trump officials <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/experts-slam-pulte-trump-50-year-mortgage-idea-00645379" target="_blank">have been mulling</a>. That would allow homeowners to essentially take their mortgage rate with them when they move.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are scrambling to hammer out a host of complex, 11th-hour intraparty policy fights in the massive <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_DRAFT20" target="_blank">annual defense policy bill</a>, delaying the release of final legislative text beyond the expected date of Thursday, according to four people granted anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.</p> 
<p>They are still pushing to release text of the sprawling bill by the end of the weekend, according to two of the people. But GOP leaders are going back and forth with White House officials about a raft of final issues, including <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/12/white-house-backing-push-to-attach-senate-housing-package-to-must-pass-defense-bill-00674916" target="_blank">Senate housing legislation</a> that the administration wants but a key House committee chair opposes.</p> 
<p>President Donald Trump and his deputies are eager to address housing costs, and top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio told a closed-door meeting of House Republicans earlier Wednesday that Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/tony-fabrizio-health-drug-prices-00674841" target="_blank">need to focus more on housing issues</a> ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p> 
<p>With White House officials digging in, congressional GOP leaders are now considering whether to add a revised or scaled down version of the Senate’s “ROAD to Housing” legislation to the Pentagon bill, but no final decisions have been made, according to the people. House Financial Services Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227472" data-person-id="227472">French Hill</a> has previously opposed the parts of the measure and said in a statement late Wednesday that “any housing package must have the buy-in” of his committee.</p> 
<p>“Given our Conference has not seen any text, it’s unclear how we could support its inclusion in the NDAA,” Hill said.</p> 
<p>Other issues GOP leaders are still working through include whether to add in <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/02/congress/china-investment-crackdown-in-flux-as-lawmakers-rush-to-finalize-defense-bill-00673705" target="_blank">new restrictions on U.S. investments in China</a>, as well as provisions that would expand coverage for in vitro fertilization and other fertility services for military families under the Defense Department’s Tricare health system.</p> 
<p>GOP leaders are reviewing the IVF expansion, which was included in both the House and Senate-passed defense bills. Pushed by Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/198768" data-person-id="198768">Tammy Duckworth</a> (D-Ill.), Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/369735" data-person-id="369735">Sara Jacobs</a> (D-Calif.) and others, the provision wasn’t included in <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/04/congress/tammy-duckworth-ivf-donald-trump-00192544" target="_blank"><u>last year’s defense bill</u></a> amid concerns about the practice from some conservatives.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> said in a statement that he “has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically.”</p> 
<p>The last-minute moves could weigh heavily on how easily Republican leaders can get the votes needed to pass the sprawling Pentagon bill, which the House aims to do next week.</p> 
<p>The annual National Defense Authorization Act typically passes with broad bipartisan support. Johnson won passage of a <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_3838" target="_blank">hard-right version of the defense bill</a> in September with just the support of a handful of Democrats, while the Senate cleared <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_S_2296" target="_blank">its own version</a> with support from both parties.</p> 
<p>Bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees made quick work of their negotiations on a compromise defense bill, which largely concluded before Thanksgiving.</p> 
<p>The legislation was then handed up to House and Senate leaders to hammer out what provisions that fall outside of Armed Services’ jurisdiction would be attached. Top lawmakers on those panels have cautioned against attaching unrelated issues that don’t have broad support and could tank the final bill.</p> 
<p>House and Senate leaders have already had to retreat on some fronts. Trump urged lawmakers to include a contentious moratorium on state regulations for artificial intelligence backed by House Majority Whip <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a> and other Republicans. But the effort foundered, and Scalise this week conceded the NDAA “wasn't the best place for this to fit.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chris Jaarda, who has spent the past two years as a senior policy adviser and counsel to House Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" target="_blank" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a>, has left the Hill to join Holland &amp; Knight as a partner in the firm’s lobbying practice.</p> 
<p>Jaarda’s portfolio in Johnson’s office spanned a variety of topics, including privacy, emerging technologies, foreign intelligence, homeland security and supply chain and production issues. His role also involved serving as a liaison between the speaker’s office and House panels such as the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, Oversight Committee, Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committee. Jaarda said in an interview that he worked closely on seven of the 11 titles in this summer’s GOP megabill.</p> 
<p>Now, he’ll advise the firm’s clients on their engagement at the state and federal levels as the Trump administration and statehouses begin to implement the law. (In August, Holland &amp; Knight hired Andrew Siracuse, another former Hill staffer who worked on the reconciliation bill under Texas GOP Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51170" target="_blank" data-person-id="51170">John Cornyn</a>.)</p> 
<p>Jaarda, who plans on registering to lobby, also has insights about key players on the Hill, especially as it pertains to the way Johnson has managed to navigate Republicans’ razor-thin House majority. “I think understanding that process, and what moves the needle on certain issues, hopefully will be very helpful” to the firm’s clients, he said.</p> 
<p>Jaarda earlier spent three years working for Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/175665" target="_blank" data-person-id="175665">Ted Cruz</a> (R-Texas), including serving as Cruz’s deputy chief of staff for policy and legislative director. Before that, he did stints for former Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), the Senate GOP Policy Committee and former Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), in addition to starting his own consulting firm.</p> 
<p>Jaarda is the latest House GOP leadership staffer to head downtown in the past year. Johnson’s policy director, Dan Ziegler, left the Hill in the spring to return to Williams &amp; Jensen. And a handful of top aides to House Majority Leader <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59655" target="_blank" data-person-id="59655">Steve Scalise</a>, including his longtime chief of staff, have decamped for the private sector as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Trump pollster’s health care advice for Republicans: Pivot to drug prices</title>
      <link>https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/03/congress/tony-fabrizio-health-drug-prices-00674841</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top pollster for President Donald Trump advised a group of House Republicans on how to defend against Democrats’ attacks over expiring Obamacare tax credits: focus on reducing drug prices instead.</p> 
<p>Tony Fabrizio showed new polling to members of the Republican Study Committee in a closed-door meeting held a few blocks from the Capitol Wednesday. He argued the most effective way for Republicans to counter Democrats’ health care messaging is to change the subject and pivot to reducing drug prices in tandem with Trump.</p> 
<p>The presentation was described by a House Republican aide and two people in the room who were granted anonymity to discuss the closed-door event. Speaker Mike Johnson, an RSC member, attended the briefing. Fabrizio did not return a request for comment. </p> 
<p>Notably, the House GOP aide said Fabrizio did not recommend any extension of the insurance subsidies, something he has <a href="https://fabrizioward.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pup-tcd-tax-credit-survey-memo.pdf" target="_blank">advocated for in the past</a>. The Trump administration has recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/trumps-cms-touts-12b-savings-from-medicare-drug-price-negotiations-00669231" target="_blank">refocused attention on drug pricing</a>, a topic the president tends to return to when Democrats try to hammer him on health care.</p> 
<p>Trump has tried to pressure House Republican leaders to address drug prices before, with little luck. He <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/01/congress/johnson-not-a-big-fan-of-drug-policy-white-house-wants-for-trumps-megabill-00320974" target="_blank">wanted to add a most favored nation provision</a> to the GOP megabill in the final hours before its passage this summer, a policy opposed by the drug industry and GOP leaders themselves, along with some other Republicans. Speaker Mike Johnson said at the time he was "not a big fan" of the policy.</p> 
<p>Fabrizio also spoke extensively about housing as a key area of potential focus for Republicans as high home prices and interest rates weigh on voters. The RSC itself is pushing housing policy as a key focus for a potential party-line bill the GOP could pass ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>Notably, Fabrizio encouraged House Republicans to work on advancing so-called portable mortgages, an idea some Trump officials <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/experts-slam-pulte-trump-50-year-mortgage-idea-00645379" target="_blank">have been mulling</a>. That would allow homeowners to essentially take their mortgage rate with them when they move.</p> 
<p>He also gave a postmortem rundown on the results from Tuesday’s Tennessee special election, where Republicans held onto the safe red seat albeit by a single-digit margin — raising concerns for the GOP ahead of next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>Fabrizio argued it was a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/tennessee-election-republican-midterms-fallout-00674124" target="_blank">closer race than Republicans would have liked</a> because they weren’t talking enough about affordability issues facing voters. He told the group to “stay the course and talk about the realities of the economy,” one House Republican present said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Elise Stefanik said Speaker Mike Johnson would lose an election to lead the House if a vote were suddenly called.</p> 
<p>In <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-house-speaker-c41659cb?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1" target="_blank">an interview with the Wall Street Journal</a> Tuesday night, the New York lawmaker said Johnson is an “ineffective leader” who is losing control of the Republican party.</p> 
<p>“He certainly wouldn’t have the votes to be speaker if there was a roll-call vote tomorrow,” said Stefanik, a close ally to President Donald Trump. “I believe that the majority of Republicans would vote for new leadership. It’s that widespread.”</p> 
<p>Johnson replaced former Rep. Kevin McCarthy to helm the lower chamber in 2023, accepting the speaker’s gavel after a historic series of multiple rounds of voting. He easily won reelection to the speakership earlier this year on a near-party-line vote.</p> 
<p>It’s not the first time Stefanik, who is running for governor, has criticized the speaker.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, she <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-feud-00674030" target="_blank">accused Johnson</a> of blocking provisions to the National Defense Authorization Act that would notify Congress if the FBI begins investigating federal candidates.</p> 
<p>Johnson, she said Monday in <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1995596731543671069" target="_blank">a post to X</a>, is “getting rolled by House Dems attempting to block my provision to require Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office.”</p> 
<p>Still, Johnson appears to have the favor of Trump, who has been able to keep a lid on most GOP internal disputes this year and was credited with mediating the quarrel between Johnson and Stefanik.</p> 
<p>But <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/12/03/young-republicans-to-host-far-right-german-leader-after-leaked-chat-00674051" target="_blank">in an interview with Playbook</a>, Stefanik pointed out that between Trump and Johnson, “one has historic support among Republican voters, and one has catastrophic, plummeting support among Republican voters.”</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats watching from the sidelines have cheered on the in-fighting with glee.</p> 
<p>“THE GIRLS ARE FIGHTING!” a <a href="https://mailchi.mp/dccc.org/the-girls-are-fighting-as-mike-johnson-and-elise-stefanik-brawl-online-mike-lawler-is-left-to-pick-his-favorite-party-boss?e=5f1378536e" target="_blank">Tuesday memo</a> from the DCCC highlighting the Stefanik-Johnson feud said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Henry Cuellar will seek reelection as a Democrat after Trump pardon</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar filed for reelection Wednesday as a Democrat and told reporters he had no intention to retire or switch parties hours after President Donald Trump announced pardons for him and his wife.</p> 
<p>“It came as a surprise,” Cuellar told a small group of reporters about the pardon. “I want to thank President Trump for this. … Now we clear the air. Nothing has changed, and we’re going to be ready to win re-election again.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s announcement of the pardons Wednesday morning immediately stoked speculation that the 11-term veteran might finally switch to the GOP after years of entreaties or simply retire — giving Republicans a much better chance to flip his competitive Rio Grande Valley seat.</p> 
<p>But Cuellar quickly assured a small group of senior Democrats that he would not switch parties, according to two people granted anonymity to describe the private conversations. He also filed reelection paperwork with Texas state officials Wednesday.</p> 
<p>“Nothing has changed — I'm a good old conservative Democrat,” Cuellar said Wednesday.</p> 
<p>Trump claimed on Truth Social that Cuellar’s prosecution was the result of his speaking out against former President Joe Biden’s immigration policy. Cuellar and his wife Imelda were indicted last year on more than a dozen corruption charges including bribery.</p> 
<p>“Henry, I don’t know you, but you can sleep well tonight — Your nightmare is finally over!” Trump posted.</p> 
<p>The clemency for Cuellar comes as the president faces backlash for his use of the pardon power, including for officials in his own party. Trump has also railed for years about Biden’s alleged “weaponization” of law enforcement, and the Cuellar pardon could serve to show that his interest in that subject crosses party lines.</p> 
<p>But it stands to complicate the GOP’s longstanding effort to oust Cuellar from office. He is near the top of the party’s 2026 target list, and a top Republican recruit <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/02/webb-county-judge-tano-tijerina-congressional-run/" target="_blank">entered the race Tuesday</a>.</p> 
<p>Trump’s glowing praise of the Texas Democrat in his announcement of the pardon Wednesday — and Cuellar’s determination to seek reelection — shocked Republicans who have tried to defeat him for years.</p> 
<p>Rep. Pete Sessions, informed of the news, said Cuellar’s electoral intentions show “there was not a quid pro quo" with Trump over the pardon. But the veteran Texas Republican and former NRCC chair declined to opine further.</p> 
<p>“Very interesting,” he said. “Very interesting.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bipartisan group of senators and House members led by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260077" data-person-id="260077">Josh Gottheimer</a> (D-N.J.) and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/348387" data-person-id="348387">Jen Kiggans</a> (R-Va.) will be meeting Wednesday afternoon with Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66858" data-person-id="66858">Bill Cassidy</a> (R-La.) to see if there’s a path forward on bipartisan health care legislation, according to a person granted anonymity to share plans for the closed-door session.</p> 
<p>The meeting is notable because Cassidy, chair of the Senate HELP Committee, has been working with Senate Finance Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51173" data-person-id="51173">Mike Crapo</a> (R-Idaho) on a party-line alternative to Democratic legislation that is expected to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Gottheimer and Kiggans have been trying to forge a compromise on the subsidies; both are members of the Problem Solvers Caucus and have been working with a variety of lawmakers on the issue.</p> 
<p>Bipartisan discussions on potential health plans remain fragmented. Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> is facing intense pressure from conservatives to let the subsidies expire, but vulnerable House Republicans are adamant that something needs to be done to address skyrocketing premiums before the end of the year. </p> 
<p>Gottheimer and Kiggans are also set to announce a new "CommonGround 2025" framework Thursday that would extend the expiring premium tax credits. It is endorsed by more than 30 House members of both parties, according to a media advisory issued Wednesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Jack Smith subpoenaed for closed-door House Judiciary interview</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to former special counsel Jack Smith, who led investigations into President Donald Trump, ordering him to appear at a closed-door session later this month.</p> 
<p>Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) demanded in a letter to Smith that the former DOJ official who oversaw cases around Trump’s retention of classified documents and efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election provide documents by Dec. 12 and sit for a deposition with the panel on Dec. 17. </p> 
<p>It is a marked escalation after Smith signaled an <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/14/congress/jordan-wants-jack-smith-testimony-00607878" target="_blank">openness to answering questions</a> and weeks of negotiations over the terms of an interview. Smith asked for a public hearing rather than a closed-door interview.</p> 
<p>Smith’s lawyer Peter Koski said in a statement that his client looked forward to meeting with the panel later this month but that he regretted he could not appear in a public setting.</p> 
<p>“Nearly six weeks ago Jack offered to voluntarily appear before the House Judiciary committee in an open hearing to answer any questions lawmakers have about his investigation into President Trump's alleged efforts to unlawfully overturn the election results and retention of classified documents,” Koski said. “We are disappointed that offer was rejected, and that the American people will be denied the opportunity to hear directly from Jack on these topics.”</p> 
<p>Republican lawmakers have become increasingly fixated on the probes launched during Joe Biden's presidency and Smith’s stewardship of the cases, arguing that the efforts amounted to a campaign to undermine Trump. They have sought to argue that Biden and his allies weaponized the Justice Department, even as Trump has publicly called on his attorney general to prosecute his political adversaries.</p> 
<p>The cause has become personal for some GOP members following revelations that the Justice Department requested some lawmakers' phone records as part of its investigative work. Jordan recently revealed that the Justice Department subpoenaed years worth of his phone data.</p> 
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the committee's top Democrat, defended the former special counsel and his tactics in a statement and questioned why Republicans are insisting on having Smith testify behind closed doors. But he also criticized the phone record request targeting Jordan, which was issued before Smith was named to his post.</p> 
<p>“Special Counsel Smith’s careful investigative steps stand in contrast to a separate subpoena issued for 2.5 years of Chairman Jordan’s personal phone records that was recently produced to the Committee and appears manifestly overbroad," he said, adding that Smith's requests "were narrowly tailored to obtain phone records for the days surrounding January 6."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House Oversight Committee has received new materials from major financial institutions as part of its investigation into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as photos and videos of Epstein's private compound from authorities in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p> 
<p>The files from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank have not yet been publicly released, though Democrats on the panel say they expect to release them in the coming days after a review. These documents are separate from the federal law enforcement records Congress voted to make public last month; the Justice Department is required to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/the-epstein-files-are-coming-what-should-we-expect-00660323" target="_blank">make those materials public</a> later this month.</p> 
<p>“[House Oversight Democrats] intend to release files to the public in the days ahead,” said Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel, in a post on X. A spokesperson for the committee’s Republican majority confirmed the receipt of the materials.</p> 
<p>Democrats publicly <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/e7n5g4wz0cjngv9u9qys2/AHNOf8vcSNtejTpIcQGaICs?dl=0&amp;e=2&amp;rlkey=c8fds6c4a8t6zwoiglx4c7kt3&amp;st=16dpmuw0" target="_blank">posted videos and photos</a> Wednesday that were provided by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned his infamous private retreat. <br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/4d/fa/41ab8b5c44dc80cb7c06b635337c/unlimiteduse-epsteinusvi-016.JPG" alt="An undated photograph of Jeffrey Epstein's island compound provided by authorities in the U.S. Virgin Islands, published Dec. 3, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee." data-portal-copyright="Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands via House Oversight Committee" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="An undated photograph of Jeffrey Epstein's island compound provided by authorities in the U.S. Virgin Islands, published Dec. 3, 2025, by the House Oversight Committee."/><p>They include shots inside the island compound, including a photo of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell with Pope John Paul II. Others showed various parts of the property.</p> 
<p>Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her part in the sex trafficking scheme.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers asked Wednesday for a meeting with Justice Department personnel to ascertain what information is in its possession and is subject to release. <br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/fd/40/72d64553488b9cc2bd4b9bc057fc/unlimiteduse-epsteinusvi-020.jpg" alt="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's island compound provided by authorities in the U.S. Virgin Islands shows Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell with Pope John Paul II, published by the House Oversight Committee on Dec. 3, 2025." data-portal-copyright="Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands via House Oversight Committee" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="" data-title="An undated photograph from Jeffrey Epstein's island compound provided by authorities in the U.S. Virgin Islands shows Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell with Pope John Paul II, published by the House Oversight Committee on Dec. 3, 2025."/><p>Reps.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter that that they are “particularly focused on understanding the contents of any new evidence, information or procedural hurdles that could interfere with the Department’s ability meet this statutory deadline.”</p> 
<p>The lawmakers, who were the lead sponsors of the Epstein files legislation, asked for a briefing no later than Friday and urged the DOJ to coordinate with the lawyers for Epstein’s accusers.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump pardoned Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the president announced in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, blaming former President Joe Biden for weaponizing the Justice Department against his opponents.</p> 
<p>“Sleepy Joe went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman's wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115656343773820545" target="_blank">Trump wrote</a>. “It is unAmerican and, as I previously stated, the Radical Left Democrats are a complete and total threat to Democracy.”</p> 
<p>Cuellar and his wife were <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/03/congress/cuellar-indicted-00155977" target="_blank">charged in 2024 with accepting $600,000</a> in bribes from foreign entities. The moderate Democrat — who has long been a battleground target for Republicans — was nonetheless reelected to his South Texas seat in November.</p> 
<p>Trump’s pardon of Cuellar comes just a day after national Republicans got their top recruit to challenge him in a seat made redder thanks to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/20/texas-republican-maps-redistricting-trump-00517274" target="_blank">Texas’ mid-decade redistricting</a>. Webb County Judge Tano Tijerina, a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/10/texas-webb-county-judge-tano-tijerina-republican/" target="_blank">former Democrat who switched parties last year,</a> announced his campaign for the 28th District as a Republican on Tuesday after months of speculation.</p> 
<p>Cuellar told a small group of Democrats Wednesday he is not planning to switch parties after Trump pardoned him, according to two people granted anonymity to describe the private calls. He just filed for re-election in South Texas.</p> 
<p>His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his pardon, but he thanked Trump in a social media post shortly after the president’s announcement. The longtime lawmaker had denied any criminal allegations in a statement following his indictment.</p> 
<p>“I want to thank President Trump for his tremendous leadership and for taking the time to look at the facts,” <a href="https://x.com/RepCuellar/status/1996254124354986003" target="_blank">Cuellar wrote on X</a>. “This decision clears the air and lets us move forward for South Texas.”</p> 
<p>On Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump accused the Biden administration of targeting Cuellar, even though he is a Democrat, due to the lawmaker’s position on immigration.</p> 
<p>The Texan had been a vocal critic of Biden and his immigration policies, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/12/henry-cuellar-pbdd-00096425" target="_blank">telling POLITICO in 2023</a> that he believed Biden was too influenced by his party’s left flank on immigration.</p> 
<p>“They will attack, rob, lie, cheat, destroy, and decimate anyone who dares to oppose their far left Agenda, and Agenda that, if left unchecked, will obliterate our magnificent country,” Trump wrote.</p> 
<p>Attached to the president’s Truth Social post was a letter sent by Cuellar’s children. They described their parents as “good, decent people who have spent their lives giving more than they’ve taken” and raised concerns that “our father’s independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began.”</p> 
<p>This isn’t the first time Trump has dropped charges against a Democratic official. In February, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trumps-justice-department-moves-to-drop-charges-against-eric-adams-00203483" target="_blank">Justice Department tossed a bribery case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams</a>, reportedly part of an effort to gain his cooperation on immigration enforcement in the city.</p> 
<p>The president has made extensive use of his clemency powers since retaking office, most recently to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/trump-honduras-pardon-drug-trafficking-00672632" target="_blank">pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández</a>. Hernández faced a 45-year prison sentence after being <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/juan-orlando-hernandez-former-president-honduras-sentenced-45-years-prison-conspiring" target="_blank">convicted on drug trafficking charges in 2024</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227481" data-person-id="227481">Elise Stefanik</a> declared victory over Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> Wednesday, saying she had secured the inclusion of a key provision she wanted attached to the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_DRAFT20" target="_blank">annual Pentagon policy bill</a> after a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-feud-00674030" target="_blank">remarkable public spat with the speaker</a> a day earlier. </p> 
<p>Others involved credited President Donald Trump for playing mediator after the New York Republican threatened to "tank" the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act as part of her public targeting of Johnson. The three spoke by phone Tuesday night about her threats, according to two people granted anonymity to describe the private call. </p> 
<p>Stefanik said in a <a href="https://x.com/elisestefanik/status/1996184177335480682?s=46" target="_blank">Wednesday norning X post</a> that “after a productive discussion” with Trump and Johnson last night, “the provision requiring Congressional disclosure when the FBI opens counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office will be included” as part of an agreement to pass the Pentagon bill. </p> 
<p>A floor vote on the package is expected next week. A spokesperson for Johnson declined to weigh in on the private conversations.</p> 
<p>Stefanik, a member of Johnson’s leadership team, accused the speaker Tuesday of personally excluding her measure from the defense bill and lying about it. Johnson said those allegations were “false” and countered that bipartisan committee leaders had not agreed to add it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Capitol agenda: GOP fears what Tennessee means for 2026</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson held onto a much-needed red seat in Tennessee Tuesday night — but fellow Republicans say this <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/tennessee-aftyn-behn-matt-van-epps-democrats-00674118" target="_blank">isn’t cause for celebration</a>.</p> 
<p>Johnson’s leadership’s team was bracing for a tighter-than-comfortable race in the special election to succeed former Rep. Mark Green.</p> 
<p>But the single-digit margin of victory for Matt Van Epps was still a hard pill to swallow after national Republicans pulled out all the stops to rescue their candidate on the final days of the campaign, with the speaker himself traveling to the district to make a final pitch.</p> 
<p>“It was too close,” said one House GOP leadership aide.</p> 
<p>The surprisingly-tight race between Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn “is a sign that 2026 is going to be a bitch of an election cycle,” one House Republican told POLITICO. “Republicans can survive if we play team and the Trump administration officials play smart. Neither is certain.”</p> 
<p>Retiring Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) warned “the GOP should not ignore” how close it came to losing a district President Donald Trump won by 22 points in 2024 — not to mention the Democratic gubernatorial victories in Virginia and New Jersey last month.</p> 
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) agreed it was a “dangerous” sign for his party. “In a year, it’s going to be a turnout election, and the left will show up,” Cruz said in an interview with Fox on Tuesday night. “Hate is a powerful motivator. They hate President Trump.”</p> 
<p>This close call in Tennessee adds to the ongoing headaches for Johnson back in Washington.</p> 
<p>The speaker is facing a revolt led by a member of his own leadership team, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), over news that the National Defense Authorization Act likely won’t include her provision to require the FBI to notify Congress when it opens investigations into candidates running for federal office.</p> 
<p>Stefanik, who is running for governor, announced Wednesday morning the provision was added back into the NDAA after talking to Johnson — a day after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-feud-00674030" target="_blank">accusing the speaker of blocking the provision</a> and “lying” about it. But with the language back in, Johnson risks losing Democratic support that could be crucial for getting the historically-bipartisan package over the finish line.</p> 
<p>Johnson could also be on the verge of being undermined by his own members who want a vote on legislation that would <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/02/congress/anna-paulina-luna-congressional-stock-trading-ban-00673180" target="_blank">ban congressional stock trading</a>. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) officially moved Tuesday to lay the groundwork to circumvent leadership and force that vote, with Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) saying he and Luna were “tired” of waiting.</p> 
<p>Also on Tuesday: Johnson <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/02/congress/college-sports-bill-heads-to-final-vote-despite-gop-defections-00673376" target="_blank">faced a small rebellion</a> on the House floor over a procedural move involving legislation to regulate name, image and likeness compensation in college sports. That could spell trouble around a final vote coming Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>And then there’s health care. Johnson is promising that House Republicans will <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/republicans-want-a-health-care-plan-they-dont-know-what-will-go-in-it-00673969" target="_blank">come up with a health policy proposal</a>. But there’s no sign he’ll be able to bring together moderates like Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who wants to extend the enhanced Obamacare tax credits, and conservatives who are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/03/obamacare-subsidies-expire-this-month-many-republicans-are-shrugging-00672949" target="_blank">downplaying the effects</a> of letting the subsidies lapse.</p> 
<p>As retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Tuesday, midterm backlash for the GOP could be substantial if Republicans don’t do something to prevent premiums going up come January.</p> 
<p><b><i>What else we’re watching:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b></p> 
<p><b>— Venezuela fallout: </b>Significant <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/boat-strike-republican-trump-loyalty-00673439" target="_blank">cracks in GOP unity</a> are growing amid Trump’s campaign to kill alleged drug traffickers off the coast of Venezuela. </p> 
<p><b>— Hawley’s health care pitch: </b>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is rolling out a bill to allow all taxpayers to deduct up to $25,000 in medical expenses. The bill also allows out of pocket expenses on health care premiums to be deducted.</p>

It's one of the last outstanding issues for lawmakers to resolve as they look to release compromise bill text Thursday.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even by the high standards of chaos for the 119th Congress, Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> being accused Tuesday by a member of his own leadership team of protecting the “deep state” was a remarkable development.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/227481" data-person-id="227481">Elise Stefanik</a>’s rare move to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/02/congress/stefanik-accuses-johnson-lying-00672634" target="_blank">publicly accuse the speaker</a> of being a liar and then, in a separate provocation, signing on to an effort to force a vote on legislation Johnson has kept bottled up is the latest symptom of a House Republican Conference seemingly on a razor’s edge.</p> 
<p>Increasingly, rank-and-file House Republicans are bringing their spats with Johnson into the open, suggesting the speaker is losing further control over his restive members as his already slim majority threatens to narrow further and potentially devastating midterm elections loom.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/260571" data-person-id="260571">Kevin Kiley </a>(R-Calif.), who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/kevin-kiley-shutdown-gop-critic-00608517" target="_blank">openly challenged Johnson’s decision</a> to keep the House out of session for seven weeks this fall and criticized him for not pushing back on the GOP’s mid-decade redistricting campaign, said in a brief interview Tuesday that he saw Stefanik’s anger as part of broader trend.</p> 
<p>“I do think that there's a lot of frustration right now in the House with the effectiveness or lack thereof of this body in recent months,” he said. “The House has … in some cases ceded its own authority, hasn't taken the lead on a lot of important policy measures and has even taken steps now to limit the agency of individual members.”</p> 
<p>For much of his two-year tenure, Johnson has been able to keep a handle on the infighting thanks to President Donald Trump’s stranglehold on the Republican Party, with the president personally intervening at key points this year to settle internecine disputes.</p> 
<p>But many sense that is changing as the speaker suffers public setbacks — such as his recent failure to prevent passage of a bill mandating the release of Justice Department files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Things could fray further depending on how the GOP fares in <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/02/congress/house-republicans-tennessee-special-election-00672582" target="_blank">Tuesday’s special election in Tennessee</a>.</p> 
<p>"That model only works if no one challenges him and gets away with it," said one senior House Republican granted anonymity to speak frankly about conference dynamics. "And that's not what's happening now. … People are less willing to stay quiet.”</p> 
<p>In particular, several high-profile GOP women have clashed with the speaker over various issues in recent months. Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/337881" data-person-id="337881">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> of Georgia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado were instrumental in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/epstein-files-bill-congress-00655286" target="_blank">pushing through the Epstein bill</a>. Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/364729" data-person-id="364729">Anna Paulina Luna</a> of Florida filed her second discharge petition of the year Tuesday, seeking to force a vote on a bill banning member stock trading that the speaker has so far declined to advance. And several women in the House GOP raised concerns about leaders’ handling of Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.), who is facing multiple accusations regarding his conduct and ethics.</p> 
<p>Stefanik is in another category altogether. A year ago, she was the No. 4 House GOP leader before relinquishing her post in anticipation of her confirmation as ambassador to the United Nations. But Trump withdrew her nomination amid concerns about the thin GOP majority — a move for which Stefanik has privately faulted Johnson.</p> 
<p>Johnson granted her an unelected junior leadership role as a consolation prize, but she has decided her political future will not lie in the House, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/07/elise-stefanik-new-york-governor-campaign-launch-00641679" target="_blank">launching a campaign for New York governor</a> instead of seeking re-election. And now she appears to be all-in on a scorched earth campaign against the speaker.</p> 
<p>"Elise is running for governor and frankly does not give a fuck anymore about playing nice," said a second House Republican granted anonymity to speak frankly about the dispute.</p> 
<p>The precipitating cause for Stefanik’s public outburst, in her telling, was a leadership-level decision to exclude legislation requiring that Congress be informed of counterintelligence probes into candidates for federal offices from the annual defense policy bill — a must-pass measure to which lawmakers are keen to attach their personal priorities.</p> 
<p>After Stefanik <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/02/congress/stefanik-accuses-johnson-lying-00672634" target="_blank">posted her displeasure</a> to her X account, Johnson tried to tamp down the furor Tuesday. The speaker, who sometimes jokes he’s more of a mental health counselor, told reporters he couldn’t understand why Stefanik “didn’t just call me” and that the two could have handled the dispute in private.</p> 
<p>“Just more lies from the Speaker,” Stefanik retorted, <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1995886289527214190" target="_blank">again on X</a>, mocking Johnson’s claims of ignorance. “This is his preferred tactic to tell Members when he gets caught torpedoing the Republican agenda.”</p> 
<p>House Republicans close to Stefanik argue there are more GOP members who are upset about the congressional notice provision falling out of the Pentagon bill. Notably, House Judiciary Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/51745" data-person-id="51745">Jim Jordan</a> (R-Ohio) said he had not yet thought about whether he would join Stefanik in withholding his support for the bill over its exclusion.</p> 
<p>“We want this protection in there,” he told reporters. “I think it makes sense.”</p> 
<p>Just hours after Stefanik’s comments, Johnson faced down a brief revolt over a procedural measure on the House floor led by hard-line Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other incensed Republicans that would have derailed GOP leaders’ floor plans for the week.</p> 
<p>As that crisis was still unfolding, Luna launched her <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/24/house-discharge-petitions-mike-johnson-00666557" target="_blank">discharge petition</a> to force a vote on a congressional stock trading ban — and Stefanik quickly announced she was signing on to the move undermining the speaker’s authority.</p> 
<p>Members of Johnson’s leadership circle and other senior Republicans were privately shocked by Stefanik’s sharp public criticism of the speaker — and that she didn’t later decide to delete them — according to three people granted anonymity to describe conversations that unfolded Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Johnson’s staff have reached out to Stefanik’s team and are seeking to resolve the spat privately, according to two other people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p> 
<p>The speaker’s allies argue the disgruntled Republicans are just that — people with axes to grind against Johnson.</p> 
<p>But Stefanik is getting backup from other malcontents inside the House GOP, including Greene, who was once seen as being on the opposite pole of the Republican conference. Both women were kept in close consultation by the previous speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and have since fallen out with Johnson.</p> 
<p>After helping to engineer the successful Epstein files vote, Greene <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-from-congress-after-clash-with-trump-00665972" target="_blank">announced her imminent resignation</a> — itself a slap at Johnson, given the tight GOP majority — and publicly railed against the House’s diminished power and Johnson’s speakership. She weighed in again Tuesday after Stefanik aired her accusations about the Pentagon bill.</p> 
<p>“No surprises here,” Greene said in her <a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1995869033590321660" target="_blank">own X post</a>. “As usual from the Speaker, promises made promises broken. We all know it.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican lawmakers are looking to craft their own health care policy overhauls by the end of next week, when Senate Democrats get a vote on expiring Obamacare subsidies. So far they don’t agree on what their competing plan should look like.</p> 
<p>In separate closed-door meetings Tuesday, House and Senate Republicans debated what they could put forth as they face the reality that health insurance premiums will skyrocket if enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits lapse after Dec. 31. Speaker Mike Johnson for the first time definitively promised his anxious members he would put forward some kind of health care blueprint in the coming days, while Senate Republicans discussed how to lower health care costs including through a revamp of health savings accounts. </p> 
<p>But GOP leaders in both chambers face deep divisions within their ranks about how to proceed, including whether to extend the credits at all and force Republicans to vote for the first time to affirm Obamacare. With Tuesday’s conversations producing little clarity, GOP lawmakers said they are still far away from a plan they could unite behind by the end of next week.</p> 
<p>“Have you ever heard of a Rorschach test? Let’s smear it all over the wall,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said about the state of the GOP’s health care discussions. </p> 
<p>Some Republicans on Capitol Hill worry that the failure to come up with any plan in the coming days could be a political nightmare heading into the 2026 midterms, with GOP candidates being dogged by questions about increased health care costs. </p> 
<p>Retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) Tuesday warned of a potential backlash during the midterms if the subsidies expire, predicting Democrats would pummel Republicans in 2026 by highlighting a “number of sympathetic cases” where Americans have seen their health insurance costs go up.</p> 
<p>“There’s a lot of harmonization that needs to be done,” he said about the GOP’s health care talks. </p> 
<p>During their weekly lunch Tuesday, Senate Republicans heard from Finance Chair Mike Crapo and HELP Chair Bill Cassidy about their progress in developing a Republican proposal that could be put on the floor alongside the Democratic plan. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is giving Democrats a vote as part of a deal he struck to re-open the government.</p> 
<p>As part of the lunch, Republicans discussed providing more flexibility for how health savings accounts are used, imposing income caps on ACA subsidies and requiring ACA enrollees to make minimum payments on premiums, according to senators in attendance. </p> 
<p>Cassidy, a physician, has been an evangelist for boosting health savings accounts as an alternative to extending the tax credits. He’s poised to use a HELP Committee hearing on the topic Wednesday to tout this proposal.</p> 
<p>Thune is facing competing pressures within his conference over whether the ACA subsidies should be extended or allowed to sunset. Some GOP senators said after Tuesday’s lunch they expected there would be a vote on some kind of Republican health care measure next week, but Thune wouldn’t commit to that timeline, telling reporters only that his members would continue to discuss ideas. </p> 
<p>Crapo, in an interview, said it would be a “collective decision” from the Senate GOP Conference about whether his proposal with Cassidy would get a vote next week. </p> 
<p>Republicans are also still waiting to see what the Democratic proposal will be. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after a closed-door lunch with his own caucus that they discussed the idea and to “stay tuned” on where they would land. Democrats are likely to offer a clean extension of the subsidies, but haven’t said how long that extension would be. </p> 
<p>Across the Capitol, Johnson pledged Tuesday for the first time that House Republicans will put forward a health care plan soon. Many House Republicans left a closed-door conference meeting with the sense that GOP leaders could produce a framework by the end of this week. </p> 
<p>But House GOP leaders are confronting their own internal squabbling, with one person close to leadership, granted anonymity to speak candidly, describing that goal as “ambitious.” </p> 
<p>Leaders of the House Republican Conference have also pushed to omit any ACA subsidy extension from their upcoming health care plan, alarming GOP moderates who worry their reelection prospects hinge on the subsidies’ survival.</p> 
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise got an earful on the concerns about proceeding without an ACA extension during a lunch meeting with the centrist Republican Governance Group, according to four Republicans in the room. </p> 
<p>One of the Republicans, granted anonymity to discuss the private conversation, said that nearly every member of that caucus complained to Scalise that “something needs to be done” on health care before the end of the year. Many of the members present advocated for an ACA subsidy extension. </p> 
<p>Scalise didn’t make any promises but said the “will of the conference” would decide whether Republicans could back health care provisions like an extension of the ACA subsidies — though a majority of House Republicans don’t support it. </p> 
<p>“We had a good conversation about all the work that's been done by the three committees of jurisdiction,” Scalise said in an interview after the meeting, referring to House Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means and Education and the Workforce.</p> 
<p>“Of course, members that aren't on those committees, you know, haven't been aware of some of the things that have come out, but we also wanted to get their feedback,” Scalise added.</p> 
<p>Some Republicans are holding out hope for a bipartisan breakthrough, as GOP leaders pursue what would likely be party-line options.</p> 
<p>House Problem Solvers Co-Chair Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) is working on a bill that reflects the leaked health care framework the White House was planning to reveal last week but held back amid conservative backlash. He told reporters Tuesday he has discussed the bill with the White House and it is “not addressing” abortion restrictions — a bid to entice Democrats.</p> 
<p>"We're trying to get a bill that can get 218,” Fitzpatrick said. "I think it's the most serious attempt out there."</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Ayanna Pressley won’t challenge Sen. Ed Markey for his Senate seat and instead plans to seek reelection to her House seat, she announced today, ending weeks of speculation about the progressive Democrat’s political future.</p> 
<p>“Hearing from so many people from throughout our Commonwealth encouraging me to run for the United States Senate was deeply humbling and a testament to the strength of our movement. It would be an honor to serve the whole Commonwealth—but with our daughter in her last year at home before college and a district that has been in the crosshairs of this White House, I am certain that the Massachusetts 7th is where I belong in this moment,” Pressley said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Markey, who will be 80 when he’s up for reelection next year, is already facing a challenge from Rep. Seth Moulton. The Salem Democrat has centered his campaign on a call for generational change in the wake of the 2024 elections.</p> 
<p>Pressley <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/04/congress/ayanna-pressley-for-senate-00636295" target="_blank">was considering her own bid for Senate</a>, and a recent <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/25/metro/full-poll-results-massachusetts-voters/?p1=Article_Inline_Related_Link" target="_blank">Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll</a> showed her neck-and-neck with Markey in a three-way Democratic primary. But polling also showed her entrance into the race would narrow Markey’s lead over Moulton, raising concern among progressives in the state that a three-way race could open a lane for the more moderate congressman.</p> 
<p>“Now, more than ever, is the time to dig deep, to lean into mutual aid, and to use every tool available to stand in the gap in defense of our neighbors and our democracy,” Pressley said.</p> 
<p>In a statement responding to Pressley’s announcement, Moulton called her “a powerful advocate for justice and opportunity in Massachusetts,” and Markey described the Squad member as “a champion for the 7th Congressional District, for Massachusetts, and for our nation.”</p> 
<p>“I share her commitment to the fight against authoritarianism, to take back the House and the Senate in 2026, and I am deeply grateful for her continued partnership,” Markey said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is pushing forward with a discharge petition to circumvent Speaker Mike Johnson and force a vote on a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/725" target="_blank">congressional stock trading ban</a>, she said in an interview Tuesday.</p> 
<p>The politically explosive topic is still divisive among House Republicans, but broadly popular with the public. Luna (R-Fla.) said she's done with waiting around for accountability on Capitol Hill.</p> 
<p>Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), who is working on the effort with Luna, agreed many Republicans are “tired” of GOP leaders pushing off the legislation.</p> 
<p>It’s just the latest internal GOP fight Johnson has to deal with. At the same time Luna and Burchett formally launched their discharge petition effort Tuesday afternoon, Johnson faced a revolt among his members on the House floor over a procedural move involving legislation to regulate name, image and likeness compensation in college sports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Thune says abortion language a sticking point in health care talks</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday that while bipartisan discussions are ongoing around the fate of soon-to-expire Affordable Care Act subsidies, abortion restrictions are a major sticking point.</p> 
<p>“There are conversations that continue, but as you know the Hyde issue is a difficult and challenging one on both sides,” Thune told reporters.</p> 
<p>The fight over the so-called Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/24/congress-republicans-abortion-health-00577631" target="_blank">has been looming over any potential deal</a> to extend the enhanced Obamacare tax credits. And GOP lawmakers, not to mention a cadre of influential anti-abortion groups, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/republicans-trump-obamacare-abortion-00669389" target="_blank">quickly noticed the White House’s framework was silent</a> on the issue.</p> 
<p>The White House ultimately held off on releasing that framework as it faced a mountain of GOP criticism from conservatives who felt caught off guard that Trump would back a two-year extension of the subsidies — even when paired with new income caps and other restrictions.</p> 
<p>The Senate is expected to vote next week on a proposal from Democrats to extend the ACA subsidies, but Democrats haven’t yet detailed what bill they will put on the chamber floor.</p> 
<p>Republicans are separately working on a potential counterproposal that would come from Sens. Mike Crapo and Bill Cassidy, chairs of the Senate Finance and HELP Committees, respectively. GOP senators also have yet to decide whether they’ll roll out that plan in time for a vote next week, though, and the substance remains in flux.</p> 
<p>Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Monday night that while efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement persist, many lawmakers believe they are ultimately headed toward a failed vote next week. Some senators are already looking at Jan. 30, the next government funding deadline, as the real cut-off for a health care deal.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think we’re close to a 60-vote threshold yet,” Thune said of bipartisan health care talks.</p> 
<p>There’s also uncertainty on the other side of the Capitol about how Republicans will respond to the looming expiration of the subsidies, which could cause premiums to skyrocket in the new year. Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at his weekly press conference that he “didn’t commit to” a short-term extension during a closed-door House GOP members’ meeting Tuesday morning but that “there will be a Republican response to this.”</p> 
<p>“What I’ve got to do is build consensus deliberately around the best ideas,” Johnson said. “We’re pulling those ideas together … I can’t project in advance what that will be because I don’t know what the consensus is in that room.”</p>

      <title>Stefanik accuses Johnson of lying, ‘blocking’ her defense bill provision</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Elise Stefanik is taking aim directly at Speaker Mike Johnson over signals a provision she has championed won’t be included in the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_DRAFT20" target="_blank">annual defense policy bill</a> the House wants to pass next week — marking a notable and unusual split inside the House GOP leadership team.</p> 
<p>Stefanik, a New York Republican who serves as a member of Johnson’s leadership team, said in <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1995856738994565416" target="_blank">a social media post</a> Tuesday morning she would help tank the National Defense Authorization Act if it doesn’t incorporate her provision that would require the FBI to notify Congress when it opens investigations into candidates running for federal office.</p> 
<p>“This is an easy one,” the New York Republican posted on social media Tuesday morning. “This bill is DOA unless this provision gets added in as it was passed out of committee.”</p> 
<p>Stefanik also blamed Johnson for the expected omission.</p> 
<p>“[T]he Speaker is blocking my provision to root out the illegal weaponization that led to Crossfire Hurricane, Arctic Frost, and more,” she wrote on X. “He is siding with Jamie Raskin against Trump Republicans to block this provision to protect the deep state.”</p> 
<p>Stefanik’s proposal, which would require the public disclosure of all “FBI counterintelligence investigations into presidential and federal candidates seeking office,” is designed to combat what many Republicans consider politically motivated investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 election and former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe into President Donald Trump’s efforts to subvert the election in 2020.</p> 
<p>Asked about whether he thwarted the provision’s inclusion in the NDAA, Johnson said Stefanik’s retelling of events is “false.” He said he supported the provision and that there could still be a path for its passage in some other legislative vehicle.</p> 
<p>“I don’t exactly know why Elise just won’t call me,” he said, recalling that he told his colleague over text, “What are you talking about? This hasn’t even made it to my level.”</p> 
<p>Johnson explained the bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, who he suspected have jurisdiction over this issue, had not agreed to include the language, leading to the provision being dropped from the defense bill. A spokesperson for Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, deferred to Johnson’s explanation.</p> 
<p>Stefanik quickly responded in <a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1995886289527214190" target="_blank">another post on X</a>, “Just more lies from the Speaker,” while insisting the Intelligence Committee, on which Stefanik sits, has jurisdiction over her provision.</p> 
<p>Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have been negotiating the NDAA for weeks and could roll out a compromise package as soon as Thursday; Stefanik said in her social media post that she got early details of that package in an Intelligence Committee briefing.</p> 
<p>The narrow GOP majority in the House means that Johnson can barely afford to lose any Republican support if Democrats reject the legislation en masse, but it’s far from guaranteed Stefanik’s opposition will doom the NDAA on its own.</p> 
<p>While most Democrats opposed the hard-right version of the Pentagon bill the House passed in September, more Democrats might come on board to support a compromise measure and make up for a shortfall of votes on the Republican side of the aisle. The NDAA is typically a broadly bipartisan package.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House GOP leaders are trying to steady their restive conference as they seek to avert disaster in a Tennessee special election for a ruby-red GOP-controlled seat on Tuesday night.</p> 
<p>NRCC Chair <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/43694" data-person-id="43694">Richard Hudson</a> told House Republicans in their closed-door meeting Tuesday morning that Republican Matt Van Epps will win the race. But he also said members need to remember special elections are special, according to four people in the room, all of whom were granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting.</p> 
<p>National Republicans have had to intervene to attempt to rescue Van Epps from a potential defeat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a conservative stronghold President Donald Trump won by more than 20 points.</p> 
<p>The race between Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/02/a-nationalized-tennessee-special-election-has-both-parties-on-edge-00671736" target="_blank">attracted millions in outside spending</a> from both sides, despite the typically uncompetitive nature of the district.</p> 
<p>Republicans in the room for Hudson's remarks Tuesday morning, however, did not feel much better about the state of the conference and the special election ahead of next year's midterms.</p> 
<p>"It was not overly comforting," one House Republican who attended the meeting said, noting that some GOP members quietly glanced over at each other as the North Carolina congressman argued a win is a win.</p> 
<p>Another House Republican predicted the GOP conference would spend some time reeling from the fallout of the race, given that it shouldn't have been competitive in the first place.</p> 
<p>“If our victory margin is single digits, the conference may come unhinged,” one senior House Republican said. A loss would be catastrophic and the conference would "explode," the Republican added.</p>]]></content:encoded>
