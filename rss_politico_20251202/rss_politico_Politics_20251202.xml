      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top consultant to Rep. Nancy Mace’s campaign for South Carolina governor announced his resignation Monday, saying the gubernatorial hopeful has “decided to turn her back on MAGA.”</p> 
<p>Austin McCubbin, a longtime Republican operative, bashed Mace <a href="https://x.com/austinmccubbin/status/1995536685191373122" target="_blank">in a post on X</a> and accused her of trying to “hug the political cactus that is the Rand Paul [and] Thomas Massie wing of the Party” and questioned the third-term member of Congress’ ties to the Protect Freedom PAC — a Paul-aligned committee.</p> 
<p>In his post, McCubbin claimed Mace told him she directed a friend to steer a “7-figure check” to the PAC, calling her “wittingly or unwittingly a proxy for Rand Paul’s 2028 presidential campaign.”</p> 
<p>That conversation, he said, was the catalyzing moment behind his decision to leave the campaign. POLITICO has not independently verified the claim.</p> 
<p>“My name has been used publicly, while going back on her word to pay me, to trade on my Team Trump status and to work on her behalf with the White House, and I am 100% breaking with her campaign out of loyalty to the President,” he wrote.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Mace, in a statement in response to McCubbin’s post, said: “Mr. McCubbin didn’t raise a dime for the campaign or better yet, never even bothered showing up. When he demanded $10,000 a month for ‘services’ and was told no, he ran straight to X. Good luck with that.”</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/gop-race-sc-governor-heats-up-without-trumps-endorsement-00631063" target="_blank">President Donald Trump’s endorsement</a> is all but certain to help propel his preferred candidate into Columbia’s top post. Mace — like the other candidates in the crowded field — has been angling for the president’s endorsement since her entry to the race in August.</p> 
<p>“My advice to the President, my friends in the White House, and South Carolina Trump voters: scratch her name from the list,” McCubbin wrote.</p> 
<p>Mace’s campaign for governor announced McCubbin’s hire as one of the campaign’s “lead consultants” <a href="https://nancymace.org/trump-south-carolina-state-director-joins-nancy-mace-for-governor/" target="_blank">in a press release</a> earlier this year, touting his close ties to the successful Trump campaign operations in the Palmetto State during the 2024 election. The two had also worked together previously: McCubbin managed Mace’s first reelection bid in 2022.</p> 
<p>“This is about loyalty,” McCubbin wrote, calling current Gov. Henry McMaster a “great governor” who has been “very loyal” to Trump. “South Carolina needs someone cut from the same cloth, where you know their word is their bond,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indiana state House Republicans have released a draft congressional map that would give the GOP an edge in all nine of the state’s congressional districts — potentially netting the party two seats in the Hoosier State — though the map’s passage is still far from certain.</p> 
<p>The biggest changes in the proposed map come in the state’s two Democratic-leaning districts, held by Reps. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/381227" data-person-id="381227">Frank Mrvan</a> and <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/59657" data-person-id="59657">André Carson</a>. Mapmakers split Marion County — home to Indianapolis — into four different districts, essentially diluting the Democrats' strength in the area.</p> 
<p>While the map is in line with President Donald Trump’s request for a GOP sweep, it still faces a number of obstacles in order to pass.</p> 
<p>State House Speaker Todd Huston has consistently said his caucus could pass the new map, and Speaker <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/242539" data-person-id="242539">Mike Johnson</a> huddled with lawmakers this weekend in what was described by one person briefed on the call as very "rah rah" ahead of them convening.</p> 
<p>The map’s fate in the state Senate, where President Pro Tem Rodric Bray remains opposed, is still uncertain. The White House and other outside groups continue to ramp up pressure on lawmakers resistant to redistricting, and one even <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/indiana-republican-targeted-in-pipe-bomb-threat-over-redistricting/" target="_blank">faced threats of a pipe bomb over the weekend</a>.</p> 
<p>Republicans who oppose redrawing have said its best to focus the GOP’s energy on flipping a district outright instead of changing the playing field.</p> 
<p>“It seems like the public is talking about this in terms of a binary choice: either 7-2 or redistricting and get 9-0,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/redistricting-indiana-resistance-00663698?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack" target="_blank">Bray told POLITICO last month</a>, explaining his reluctance to take on a redraw. “That is not clear at all to me, because we don’t know who’s going to run.”</p> 
<p>The draft map's release comes after months of back and forth between the White House and Indiana lawmakers, including two visits to the state from Vice President JD Vance.</p> 
<p>The state House is expected to vote on the map this week, and the state Senate is meeting next week to weigh the version passed by the House. Turning Point USA, one of the GOP groups pushing for a new map, is planning a rally at the statehouse Friday.</p> 
<p>If state lawmakers approve the map, Indiana would become the fourth GOP-led state to redraw ahead of the midterms. So far, Republicans have drawn districts that could net nine seats across Texas, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri, though legal challenges remain.</p> 
<p>A panel of federal judges <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/federal-judges-block-new-texas-congressional-map-00656680?media_author_id=62880495589&amp;media_id=3771088890070257611_62880495589&amp;ranking_info_token=GCBlYzhmNTFlNGZiYmQ0ZTkwYjI3ZjgwMDdhMmFmMjM1YiX2tbwFJpjph5INGBMzNzcxMDg4ODkwMDcwMjU3NjExKANuaGEA&amp;utm_source=ig_text_feed_timeline" target="_blank">blocked Texas’ gerrymander last month</a>, but the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/texas-supreme-court-map-case-00665951" target="_blank">has allowed it to stay in place for now</a> as it continues to consider the case ahead of the state’s filing deadline next week.</p> 
<p>Democrats have found redistricting success, too, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/california-redistricting-prop-50-passes-00635910" target="_blank">through California’s Proposition 50</a> — which could capture the party five seats of their own — as well as a court-ordered redraw in Utah. Utah’s GOP-controlled <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/utah-redistricting-congressional-map-appeal-00668098" target="_blank">legislature plans to appeal</a> the court’s decision.</p> 
<p>In Virginia, Democrats took their first steps to redraw and will continue the process early next year. Maryland and Illinois <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/democrats-redistricting-california-wins-00638350" target="_blank">continue to face pressure from within the party</a> to pursue their own gerrymanders, but similar dynamics to Indiana have left some state lawmakers unwilling to get on board.</p> 
<p>Republicans still have their own potential states on the board. Florida is expected to start discussing the issue later this month, and Kansas and Kentucky could join in January. Other <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/28/the-republicans-thwarting-the-white-houses-redistricting-hopes-00625911" target="_blank">GOP efforts in Nebraska and New Hampshire have faltered</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats are charting a path back to power in the House as Republicans falter heading into the midterms. But first they have to contend with more than a dozen primaries across the country that are exposing deep ideological divisions within their ranks.</p> 
<p>Democrats will undergo grueling intraparty battles across the country, from purple seats with retiring incumbents to battleground districts where they hope to go on offense to safe blue seats where the primary will all but decide the eventual winner. In one case, interest groups are squaring off against each other in a central California district amplifying party divides.</p> 
<p>Animating these races are factional, ideological and demographic divides that have been brewing for years in a party that’s become more of a vehicle for opposition than one with a proactive message. Now the splits are peaking just as Democrats, buoyed by this month’s off-cycle election sweep, feel more optimistic about regaining control over the House, which would require a net gain of three seats. They also see a path — albeit much steeper — to retake the Senate.</p> 
<p>Republicans — who have a long history of intense House primaries — face a far more relaxed environment next year, allowing their candidates to stockpile cash while hotly contested Democratic races consume valuable resources.</p> 
<p>Democrats have long been grappling with a younger faction hankering to take on the establishment that is pushing policies and tactics that agitate mainstream politicians who believe their methods will yield general election victories. And the generational divides opened by Joe Biden’s decision to step off the presidential ticket in the face of immense internal pressure last year still ripple throughout the party.</p> 
<p>Some Democrats are already growing concerned about the number of primaries their party is contending with.</p> 
<p>“The beauty of a democracy is that anyone can run. But sometimes the disaster of a democracy is, they do,” said Rep. Mike Thompson, who faces a primary from a younger Democrat for his California seat. “We need to be focused. We need to be making sure that we're looking at taking back the majority, not fighting amongst ourselves.”</p> 
<p>Some Democrats say the growing enthusiasm among newcomers to run for office signals a positive future for the party as it continues to grapple with its vast losses last year.</p> 
<p>“No matter the primary dynamic, Democrats are united in our common mission to get a Congress that stops catering to the billionaires, and instead focuses on the needs of hardworking families struggling to get by under Republican rule,” Viet Shelton, spokesperson for House Democrats’ campaign arm, said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Others believe that contested primaries will help rebuild the party’s frayed relationship with its voters. <b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p>“We have a trust problem,” said Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.). “We have to make the case to people that we are not just fighting for them for the sake of fighting, but we're fighting for them because we have the empathy to understand the real day-to-day struggles.”</p> 
<p>Here’s a look at some of the hottest primaries unfolding around the country:</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">The open seats</h5> 
<p>Arizona’s 1st District was a top target for Democrats even before Republican incumbent David Schweikert decided to run for governor. Now a pair of repeat candidates are splitting groups that spend heavily in primaries.</p> 
<p>Marlene Galan-Woods has the backing of EMILYs List and BOLD PAC, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm, while Amish Shah has support from AAPI Victory Fund and ASPIRE PAC, which both support Asian-American candidates. Democratic groups continue to recruit more candidates for the race, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss private plans.</p> 
<p>A similar dynamic is playing out in Nebraska’s blue-leaning 2nd District, where GOP Rep. Don Bacon has decided not to run for reelection. BOLD PAC and EMILYs List have lined up behind Denise Powell, while the Congressional Progressive Caucus is with state Sen. John Cavanaugh for the Omaha seat.</p> 
<p>The mudslinging has begun between the opposing camps, with some corners of the party privately expressing concerns about Cavanaugh’s fundraising and that his voting record and fundraising could make him vulnerable to GOP attacks in a general election.</p> 
<p>After Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/jared-golden-retire-2026-election-00638182" target="_blank">abruptly retired earlier this month</a>, Democrats have been quickly forced to regroup in a district President Donald Trump carried by 9 points last year.</p> 
<p>Former Gov. Paul LePage has staved off any serious primary on the Republican side, while Democrats are contending with a fight between one-time Golden challenger Matt Dunlap and former Senate candidate Jordan Wood, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/12/congress/jordan-wood-maine-2nd-district-00647047" target="_blank">who switched to the open district</a> following Golden’s announcement.</p> 
<p>Democrats in the area are still recruiting, but it’s an uphill fight. One gubernatorial candidate, former state Senate President Troy Jackson had expressed interest in a bid but <a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/democratic-candidate-governor-troy-jackson-cd-2/69534964" target="_blank">ultimately decided against it</a>. Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/11/06/politics/elections/national-democrats-actively-recruiting-candidate-maine-2nd-district-n6hjn1me0n/" target="_blank">is also considering a run</a>, according to an ally, but Francis has not spoken publicly about the race.</p> 
<p>Whoever enters the race needs to act quickly. Wood has carried over cash from his well-funded Senate bid, and Dunlap has a head start over others in the progressive lane thinking about jumping in.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">The pickup opportunities</h5> 
<p>Democrats angling to pick off Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania’s 7th District are working against each other in a messy five-way primary. The Lehigh Valley seat has flipped between parties four times in the past two decades and was one of the closest House races in the country last year when Mackenzie won it for the GOP.</p> 
<p>Firefighter union head Bob Brooks has earned a raft of endorsements from across the party spectrum — from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.) to Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis and a host of unions. Carol Obando-Derstine has the backing of the district’s last Democratic representative, moderate Susan Wild, whom Mackenzie unseated in 2024, as well as EMILYs List and BOLD PAC.</p> 
<p>They’ve both been outraised by Ryan Crosswell, a former Republican who resigned from the Department of Justice following Trump’s demand that the agency drop its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. He’s drawn support from VoteVets and New Politics, which back veterans running for office.</p> 
<p>Gov. Josh Shapiro could tip the scales — the popular Democratic governor is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/democratic-party-future-pennsylvania-battleground-house-primary-rcna235400" target="_blank">expected to follow Davis</a> in backing Brooks.</p> 
<p>Democrats also face a primary headache in California’s San Joaquin Valley for the seat held by GOP Rep. David Valadao. The seat became bluer under the state’s new voter-approved map, but it has still swung between the parties in recent years. Visalia school board trustee <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/11/congress/randy-villegas-david-valadao-00286801" target="_blank">Randy Villegas</a> has backing from the party’s left wing, including from Sanders, the Progressive Caucus PAC and BOLD PAC. But Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains has rolled out a large slate of endorsements from sitting state and federal lawmakers as well as organized labor and groups like EMILYs List.</p> 
<p>“Election Night 2025 was a clean sweep for EMILYs List women and made clear that the path to flipping the House in 2026 runs through electing bold women leaders,” EMILYs List President Jessica Mackler said in a statement.</p> 
<p>There’s even quiet handwringing happening in western Montana over a brewing primary for the seat held by GOP Rep Ryan Zinke. Democrats are bullish on flipping a seat Trump won by nearly a dozen points last year, but party leaders are raising private concerns about the past <a href="https://www.aclumontana.org/app/uploads/2021/04/hb_200_-_mira_veto_request.pdf" target="_blank">lobbying work</a> on sanctuary cities and transgender issues done by <a href="https://x.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1970186539394031952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1970612075065155990%7Ctwgr%5Ed2d4db6ca124f406e849cba96ba90b73faac6a29%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.queerty.com%2Fthis-firefighter-might-run-for-congress-in-montana-hes-a-total-smoke-show-20250924%2F" target="_blank">smoke jumper</a> Sam Forstag, who is considering whether to enter the three-person race.</p> 
<h5 class="story-text__heading-medium">The comeback bid</h5> 
<p>If the national redistricting fight continues, it could further shake up at least one primary field.</p> 
<p>Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District has flipped between parties four times over the past two decades and could be made bluer by Virginia Democrats in a redraw. Former Rep. Elaine Luria is trying to mount a comeback bid, but Navy reservist James Osyf is already in the race and has posted healthy fundraising totals.</p> 
<p>“We're in the process of redistricting, and everyone expects the 2nd to be significantly different,” said Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), who represents a neighboring district.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump has held his coalition together throughout much of the first year of his second term in office like few other figures could — albeit at times with bailing twine and a red MAGA cap — but cracks are starting to show, according to the latest results from <a href="https://www.politico.com/polling" data-cms-id="0000019a-3aa3-d77a-adda-3babed030000" data-cms-href="https://www.politico.com/polling">The POLITICO Poll</a>.</p> 
<p>And it’s clear whoever tries to pick up the MAGA mantle ahead of 2028 has some serious work to do to keep the coalition together.</p> 
<p>For starters, a significant portion of 2024 Trump voters — more than a third — do not consider themselves to be MAGA Republicans. And not only are they less loyal to Trump than self-identified MAGA Republicans, the poll suggests some of them have already begun to turn on him: Non-MAGA Trump voters are much more likely to blame Trump for the state of the economy, say he has too much power and be pessimistic about the future.<br></p><p>The results underscore just how <i>sui generis</i> the cohort that reelected Trump was — and foreshadow the GOP’s coming challenges.</p> 
<p>More than half of Trump’s voters last year — 55 percent — describe themselves as MAGA, but a critical 38 percent do not, according to the survey, which comprised 2,098 U.S. adults online and was conducted Nov. 14-17, with a margin of sampling error at plus-or-minus 2 percentage points.</p> 
<p>And it’s here where the fissures start to emerge: Among those self-described MAGA voters, 47 percent say the current economy still belongs fully to Biden, compared to just 26 percent of non-MAGA Trump 2024 voters.</p> 
<p>This divide becomes even starker on areas Republicans typically don’t own, like health care, where the White House is struggling to forge a path to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies: 85 percent of MAGA Trump voters trust Republicans more to bring down health care costs, whereas just 55 percent of non-MAGA do — with 19 percent instead trusting Democrats and 27 percent saying they don’t know.</p> 
<p>When it comes to trusting a given party on the economy, 88 percent of those MAGA voters back Republicans generally; but only 63 percent of non-MAGA Trump voters support Republicans, with 28 percent saying neither party or don’t know.</p> 
<p>On affordability, the issue that Trump has said delivered him the election, and the one his own White House deputy chief of staff James Blair has said he will be “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/donald-trump-affordability-2025-elections-james-blair-00637711?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">very focused on</a>,” non-MAGA Republicans are more concerned by the cost of living than their MAGA counterparts: 59 percent to 48 percent.</p> 
<p><i>Among the other findings centering on the economy:</i><br></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>The non-MAGA cohort is less likely to feel Trump has taken the chance he had to change things in the economy: 65 percent of MAGA compared with 46 percent of non-MAGA.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li>MAGA Republicans feel their personal financial situation has improved over the past five years (52 percent to 24 percent), whereas non-MAGA GOPers are virtually tied (37 percent to 36 percent).</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li>In a fascinating divide, 73 percent of MAGA Republicans expect their personal financial situation to improve over the next 5 years, compared with 57 percent of non-MAGA Republicans.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li>Similarly, MAGA feels better off than the average American (49 percent to 17 percent), whereas non-MAGA is torn (30 percent to 29 percent).&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>What does this all mean ahead of the fast-approaching midterms? Already, we have evidence from the off-year elections that the 2024 Trump coalition isn’t holding, with Latino and young male voters shifting back to Democrats. On generic ballot vote intention, 92 percent of MAGA Republicans backed the Republican candidate, while 62 percent of non-MAGA did.<br>There’s something in the MAGA Republican voter mentality — a kind of economic optimism — that is durable even amid the current turmoil. Trump’s definition of reality permeates their own.</p> 
<p>And the GOP has less than four years to turn Trump voters into reliable Republican voters.<br></p><p><i>Like this content? Consider signing up for POLITICO's </i><a href="https://www.politico.com/playbook" target="_blank"><i>Playbook newsletter</i></a><i>. </i><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to huddle via conference call with Indiana House Republicans this weekend ahead of their upcoming state House session to redraw congressional maps, according to two people familiar with the planning and an invitation viewed by POLITICO.</p> 
<p>The meeting, ahead of next week’s session, represents an escalation of Johnson’s involvement in mid-cycle redistricting, a process driven by the White House: He has routinely said it’s an issue for individual states and one in which he has no direct involvement.</p> 
<p>House Republicans are expected to talk with Johnson on a conference call at 1 p.m. Saturday before convening on Dec. 1.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/redistricting-indiana-resistance-00663698" target="_blank">POLITICO reported</a> last week that Johnson called GOP Indiana Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray last Wednesday, after Bray, whose caucus has largely resisted redistricting, said Senate Republicans would not convene to advance new maps.</p> 
<p>In the call, Johnson expressed the importance of holding Republicans’ thin majority in the House ahead of the midterms, according to Bray. Indiana Republicans are weighing redrawing the 1st and 7th congressional districts, potentially yielding Johnson two additional seats.</p> 
<p>But earlier this week, Bray reversed course, saying his caucus would make a final decision on redistricting when they are expected to reconvene on Dec. 8.</p> 
<p>Multiple Indiana Republicans close to the process, and granted anonymity by POLITICO to discuss a matter that has resulted in personal threats to their safety, said they believe the Senate is still a handful of votes away from having support for the matter.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is going to war with Democrats over the military. It could backfire on him.</p> 
<p>The president’s attacks on six Democrats who recorded a video encouraging military members to buck unlawful orders are elevating members of a faction that just delivered big off-year wins for their party. Most hail from swing states or districts, identify as centrists and are leveraging their national security backgrounds to argue that Democrats can retake the patriotic lane.</p> 
<p>Trump is also boosting some potential 2028 presidential hopefuls, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, while further undercutting the GOP’s attempts to make New York progressives like Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the face of the Democratic Party.</p> 
<p>“Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump are providing Mark Kelly with the kind of visibility that almost no amount of money could buy,” said Barrett Marson, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, referring to the Defense secretary who ordered an investigation of Kelly. “Every 2028 contender wishes they could be attacked like this by the Trump administration.”</p> 
<p>Since Trump accused the six of “sedition” and even suggested they could be executed, they’ve racked up millions of views on social media, done the cable news circuit and blasted out fundraising appeals highlighting the attacks.</p> 
<p>It’s heightened the stature of even those who have already been the subject of speculation about their 2028 aspirations. Kelly, who was on the short list to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate last year, has already <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook-remaking-government/2025/07/23/reviews-are-in-on-the-first-2028-dem-hopefuls-00471732" target="_blank">visited a raft of early primary</a> and general-election battleground states this year. But only after Trump’s attack was he invited on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” this week.</p> 
<p>In recent months, Slotkin has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/24/slotkin-has-a-war-plan-to-beat-trump-dont-be-weak-and-woke-00308176" target="_blank">testing what she calls a “war plan”</a> to “contain and defeat Donald Trump” in speeches outside of her state, meeting with <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/11/14/slotkin-finds-dems-at-a-crossroads-00651647" target="_blank">low-propensity voters</a> and theorizing about what she calls “Project 2029.” Now she’s brought those themes to a series of interviews and public appearances over the past week.</p> 
<p>As Democrats debate how far to lean into themes of patriotism more often claimed by conservatives, a group of lawmakers organized by Slotkin released a <a href="https://x.com/ElissaSlotkin/status/1978930764692455430?s=20" target="_blank">video with anti-authoritarian themes</a> ahead of the “No Kings” protests last month. A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811" target="_blank">follow-up video last week</a> called on troops not to obey unlawful orders, prompting Trump’s explosion.</p> 
<p>The president posted on social media they were committing “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” by suggesting military members ignore their chain of command and shared a post calling for traitors to be hanged. The White House later denied Trump was threatening the lawmakers with death. Since then, the Pentagon has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/24/pentagon-to-investigate-sen-mark-kelly-for-anti-trump-video-00666894?" target="_blank">opened an investigation</a> into Kelly, who is a retired Navy captain, and the six lawmakers claim the FBI <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/25/democrats-fbi-trump-00668584" target="_blank">has made inquiries</a> through congressional authorities.<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/9c/cc/3f39da1f4b4a8b675b81bf61bdc9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2162570114" alt="Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), another Democrat with a military background, said " data-portal-copyright="Samuel Corum/Getty Images" data-has-syndication-rights="0" data-license-id="" data-licensor-name="Getty Images" data-title="Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), another Democrat with a military background, said "/><p>Democrats, particularly those with military backgrounds, have leapt to their colleagues’ defense, echoing their message about following the law and accusing Trump of weaponizing the government against his political opponents.</p> 
<p>“Trump knows that we’re a threat” to Republicans’ grip on Washington, said Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a military veteran whose Serve America PAC supports several of the Democrats in the video. “These are great leaders who can take the fight to Trump and MAGA.”</p> 
<p>“It’s classic Trump — he ratchets everything up to an 11 and it blows up in his face,” said Austin Cook, a Democratic strategist and former Slotkin spokesperson. “Not only did it reinforce everything swing voters have always hated about him, but it’s also given this group the biggest megaphone they’ve ever had.”</p> 
<p>But Tim Edson, a GOP strategist and former political director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the video will only confirm the GOP base’s preconceived, negative views of Democratic officials.</p> 
<p>“Republicans believe these Democrats are deranged with hatred of Trump, and it’s just their latest attempt to undermine lawful policies simply because they’re Trump’s policies,” Edson said. “These embarrassing antics only rally Republicans to the president.”</p> 
<p>Some Democrats think it’s too early to tell how things will shake out for the “seditious six,” as some Trump officials are <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6385589967112" target="_blank">calling the lawmakers</a>.</p> 
<p>“Whether it works or not will depend on what comes next, if an illegal order actually does come down they get to be leaders saying ‘I told you so,’” texted one strategist who has consulted for Democratic veterans and was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “If one doesn’t, they’ve simply made themselves victims to Trump’s latest attacks. Most Democrats fail at playing on his turf.”</p> 
<p>Kelly doubled down on the video’s message during his talk-show appearance Tuesday night and noted some of his Republican colleagues are expressing support: “People are starting to take a look at this and saying, ‘Wow, this is just nuts that he's going after U.S. senators and members of the House for something they said.’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some North Carolina Republicans are worried President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown in the battleground state could backfire.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration has touted its North Carolina surge as a successful operation targeting the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/17/operation-charlottes-web-dhs-arrests-worst-worst-weekend-enforcement-operations" target="_blank">“worst of the worst”</a> criminals, but some Republicans in the state — which will feature one of the most expensive and hotly contested Senate races next year — fear that message is not breaking through with voters.</p> 
<p>The White House has largely focused its immigration sweeps on blue states that Trump officials have decried as sanctuaries for unauthorized immigrants. But the move to expand immigration arrests into North Carolina, mostly in the Charlotte area, offered the first test for whether the White House’s strategy can hold up in a purple state.</p> 
<p>Former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory warned that recent local coverage, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YorpQK7yXNw" target="_blank">an incident at a Charlotte shopping center</a>, when masked agents arrested a man who said he was a U.S. citizen, and a <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article312956767.html" target="_blank">raid at a local country club</a>, may hurt the GOP on an issue it has long dominated.</p> 
<p>“Republicans had the upper hand on immigration, as long as they were going after the criminals and the gangs, but I think they’re losing the upper hand on that issue because of the apparent disjointed implementation of arrest,” McCrory said in an interview. “From a PR and political standpoint, for the first time, immigration is maybe having a negative impact on my party.”</p> 
<p>He added, “If I were the administration, I would be really emphasizing who they’ve arrested and the negative impact they’ve had on the community, but we’re not hearing that.”</p> 
<p>The concerns surrounding Trump’s Tar Heel State clampdown underscore a tension at the center of the president’s immigration agenda. The White House’s message, since January, has tied illegal immigration to violent crime in U.S. cities. But immigration officials are simultaneously under sustained pressure from the White House to increase arrests and deportation numbers, an effort that requires targeting immigrants well beyond violent criminal offenders — potentially treacherous territory for swing-state Republicans.</p> 
<p>Edwin Peacock III, a moderate Republican who lost an at-large Charlotte City Council race to Democrats earlier this month, warned of the raids leaving “a real sour aftertaste” with voters.</p> 
<p>“Is the price of doing this worth it?” Peacock added. “I don’t see this cloud moving away [from] what will be in the voters’ minds.”</p> 
<p>In line with the administration’s messaging, North Carolina Republicans have sought to keep public attention on criminal arrests. But their narrative has been overshadowed by viral social media footage highlighting arrests of immigrants without criminal records and local media reports documenting the fear coursing through churches, schools and local businesses, these Republicans said.</p> 
<p>National <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/us/trump-deportation-illegal-immigrants-voters-poll.html" target="_blank">polls in recent months</a> show voters largely support removing immigrants living in the country illegally but believe the Trump administration’s tactics have gone too far. <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HHP_Nov2025_KeyResults.pdf" target="_blank">Other polls show</a> that voters support deporting immigrants with criminal records living in the country illegally, but that support falls when those surveyed are asked about the broader pool of immigrants. And <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/latino-voters-trump-democrats-00646300" target="_blank">Republicans are losing Latino support</a>, after Trump made significant inroads with those voters — including in North Carolina — last year. From July through October, the proportion of Latino voters who say the president’s deportation agenda has gone too far has increased from 66 percent to 79 percent, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-latino-voters" target="_blank">according to a CNN poll</a>.</p> 
<p>Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307604" data-person-id="307604">María Salazar</a> (R-Fla.) this week noted 200 people were arrested over 48 hours in Charlotte. Seventy percent of them didn’t have a criminal record, according to the Department of Homeland Security, Salazar added in a CNN interview.</p> 
<p>“Kick out the ones that are bad hombres, the ones who have criminal records, the murderers and the rapists,” she said. “But do not touch the lady who has been here for 10, 20 years, contributing to the economy.”</p> 
<p>Patrick Sebastian, a GOP pollster based in North Carolina, said voters “draw a clear line” between deporting immigrants who are living in the country illegally and working but not breaking other laws, and unauthorized immigrants who have committed crimes.</p> 
<p>“In purple states, there’s broad support for removing the latter — and the left looks foolish protesting that,” Sebastian said. “But the other narrative has gotten more play over the past week, and that could be a problem for Republicans.”</p> 
<p>Trump administration officials have defended the administration’s North Carolina efforts, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem telling Fox this week that the agency is going after the “worst of the worst,” people who have “committed robberies, assaults, DUIs, getting them off the streets and keeping people safe.”</p> 
<p>A senior White House official, granted anonymity to speak about internal thinking, argued that the president is making good on his campaign to execute mass deportations. The official said the previous administration allowed for millions of unauthorized immigrants to enter the country.</p> 
<p>“The only way to fix that problem and solve it is to aggressively deport these illegal criminals,” the official said. “And so the administration is definitely going to keep doing that.”</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1991597952826306901?s=20" target="_blank">Department of Homeland Security said</a> Thursday that “Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon,” as some North Carolina residents remain on edge. Some local businesses are closed, and residents have gone into hiding. <a href="https://apnews.com/video/man-films-car-window-being-smashed-by-agents-as-immigration-enforcement-starts-in-charlotte-nc-63df61299b4d49e2935dc6b0a1b824b9" target="_blank">Viral videos filmed</a> by locals have made national news, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRInBifiRwi/" target="_blank">Democratic Gov. Josh Stein warned</a> that “masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb” were targeting American citizens and “racially profiling.”</p> 
<p>A DHS spokesperson said Thursday the enforcement surge in the Charlotte area has resulted in 370 arrests targeting “some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” though the agency refused to say how many of those arrested had criminal records. <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/17/operation-charlottes-web-dhs-arrests-worst-worst-weekend-enforcement-operations" target="_blank">Earlier this week</a>, DHS said that over two days, 44 of the 130 people arrested had committed crimes that include aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on a police officer, battery, driving under the influence and hit-and-runs. The spokesperson said the arrests also included two known gang members.</p> 
<p>“You’re seeing social media creating a hyper sense of what may be going on, and it doesn’t always provide a full context. You’ve seen, in response, the administration talking through, ‘here’s what’s actually going on. Here are the criminals that we are taking off the streets,’” said North Carolina GOP chair Jason Simmons. “You’re talking about individuals that have committed abhorrent acts — murder, sexual assault, again, trafficking of all kinds.”</p> 
<p>Meanwhile ICE and Border Patrol’s presence in North Carolina has become a feature in the contentious Senate race.</p> 
<p>Michael Whatley, the former Republican National Committee chair running for the open Senate seat, has used the raids to attack his opponent, former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nc-senate-candidate-says-ice-charlotte-ops-result-ex-gov-opponent-repeatedly-blunting-cooperation" target="_blank">In an interview on Fox News</a> this week, Whatley said if Cooper hadn’t vetoed bills requiring local law enforcement to honor ICE detainers, “then these people would not have been on the street.”</p> 
<p>Since he entered the race in July, Whatley has primarily attacked Cooper’s record as governor, <a href="https://x.com/NRSC/status/1991499144872227232" target="_blank">calling him “soft on crime.”</a> That became a particularly potent attack in August, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/08/trump-blames-democrats-murder-ukrainian-refugee-00551419" target="_blank">after a video of the murder of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail went viral</a>.</p> 
<p>“Removing criminal illegal aliens isn’t politics — it’s about keeping our communities safe,” Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to Whatley’s campaign, said in a statement. “If deporting illegal aliens who’ve molested children, assaulted women, or been convicted of weapons charges is something Democrats want to oppose, that says everything about how far left Roy Cooper and the NC Democratic Party have drifted. Michael Whatley stands with law enforcement and with North Carolina families — period.”</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://x.com/RoyCooperNC/status/1990442383125725505" target="_blank">Cooper criticized</a> the Trump administration’s operation for “randomly sweeping up people based on what they look like.”</p> 
<p>And in a statement, Cooper campaign spokesperson Kate Smart defended the governor’s record: “Roy Cooper is the only candidate who spent his career prosecuting violent criminals and keeping thousands of them behind bars, and numerous North Carolina sheriffs spoke out against this legislation at the time because of a lack of resources; a problem that Washington D.C. insider and Big Oil lobbyist Michael Whatley has made worse because of his support for cuts to local law enforcement.”</p> 
<p>The raids come weeks after Democrats swept off-year elections across the country, including in municipal and county-level positions in North Carolina. Peacock, who lost his own at-large Charlotte City Council bid, said he warned his fellow Republicans that this month’s elections were the “midterms before the midterms.”</p> 
<p>“I know Whatley and his team aren’t looking at [Charlotte] as a place they can win, but what they’re probably not considering yet is that this region, this city, could define your loss because [Democratic turnout] could be at such exponential levels compared to traditional [norms],” Peacock said.</p> 
<p>One GOP strategist working on races in North Carolina, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said there’s a risk that the picture of a citizen being separated from their family, rather than the arrests of unauthorized immigrants with criminal records, will stick, adding, “You don’t know what the enduring image is going to be in voters’ minds.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has long claimed that he — and he alone — dictates the future of the MAGA movement. And a topsy-turvey Friday will put that to the test.</p> 
<p>A weekend wellness check on the MAGA coalition: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who on Friday announced <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-from-congress-after-clash-with-trump-00665972?cid=apn" target="_blank">her resignation</a>, is spurned by its leader. And incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, held up as a midterm Republican bogeyman, is now welcomed by him.</p> 
<p>In the space of a whipsaw few hours from Friday and into Saturday morning, Trump — who has said he knows what “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2025/11/16/taylor-greene-trump-needs-to-refocus-go-back-to-america-first/" target="_blank">MAGA wants better than anybody else</a>,” — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/22/trump-victory-lap-greene-retires-00665993" target="_blank">celebrated the impending departure</a> of “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown” on Truth Social (“Marjorie went BAD,” he said) and fangirled over Mamdani (“a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani”).</p> 
<p>“A world turned upside down,” Steve Bannon, the onetime White House aide and MAGA media booster, said in a text.</p> 
<p>MAGA’s Friday trip to The Upside Down all unfolded in a week during which Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/thomas-massie-trump-jeffrey-epstein-00654214" target="_blank">another frequent intraparty Trump target</a>, effectively cracked Trump’s hold on his congressional coalition with their Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p> 
<p>Taken together, this week is the freshest reminder that the MAGA movement has always been defined more by id than ideology, the political shaped by the personal — presenting quite the challenge for whomever must hold the coalition together after Trump.</p> 
<p>Trump and Mamdani’s Friday meeting ended worlds away from where most expected it to go. The get-together, which Fox News previewed as a “showdown with socialism,” ended as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/trump-mamdani-make-love-not-war-00665861" target="_blank">friendly back-and-forth</a> between the democratic socialist and president.</p> 
<p>“We had a meeting today that actually surprised me,” Trump told reporters during the public portion of the get together.</p> 
<p>For some of the president’s most ardent supporters, Trump’s praise of Mamdani — a man he previously warned would lead to ruin in New York City, and who some of Trump’s closest allies (<a href="https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1991995672288182396" target="_blank">like Elise Stefanik</a>) spent months setting up as their personal campaign trail foil — was agonizing.</p> 
<p>“What’s the purpose of people voting in 2026 if the Democrat policies are ‘rational?'” Trump whisperer Laura Loomer said in a interview, referencing Trump’s answer to an Oval question in which he said of Mamdani, “I met with a man who’s a very rational person.”</p> 
<p>“I’m a little confused,” she continued, “because, like, I need to know for the sake of my own edification what the administration’s stance is on Mamdani.”</p> 
<p>The White House dismissed any handwringing about the direction of the president's movement.</p> 
<p>"As the architect of the MAGA movement, President Trump will always put America First. He’s secured the border; tackled Biden’s inflation crisis; lowered drug prices; ended taxes on tips, overtime, and social security; deported criminal illegal aliens; implemented important reforms to put American workers first; and more," White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.</p> 
<p>“The fact that President Trump met with the newly elected mayor of New York City shows he is willing to talk to anyone to Make America Great Again," she continued. "Only Politico would try to spin bipartisanship as a bad thing.”</p> 
<p>Political horseshoe moments in Trump’s Washington rarely last. But even some of Trump’s closest allies tried to separate themselves from Friday’s meeting. Stefanik — his onetime pick for United Nations ambassador who is now running for New York governor — has repeatedly called Mamdani a “jihadist,” a label Trump explicitly rejected on Friday.</p> 
<p>“We all want NYC to succeed. But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one,” Stefanik posted on social media on Friday, repeatedly invoking the pejorative despite Trump’s about-face.</p> 
<p>Still, Democrats — particularly those close to the incoming mayor — were thrilled with how Friday went down. “Trump respects strength and winners,” said Rebecca Katz, founding partner at Fight Agency, whose firm made ads for Mamdani.</p> 
<p>And some Democratic strategists focused on 2026 celebrated Trump undermining Republicans’ attempts to paint Mamdani as the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/republicans-try-to-remake-national-democratic-candidates-into-mamdani-copycats-00636887" target="_blank">midterm bogeyman</a> he entered the day as. Did Speaker Mike Johnson’s entire 2026 strategy just crumble?</p> 
<p>“Pour one out for the NRCC/NRSC staffers who saw their 2026 ads go up in smoke. Sad!” said the veteran Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson.</p> 
<p>Still, many are convinced that it is only a matter of when — not if — Trump’s embrace of the New Yorker will evaporate.</p> 
<p>“Plenty of time for that to come if it does,” said GOP strategist Doug Heye. “Either of them coming out of that meeting on the attack would have been a mistake, especially given they’ve both tapped into voters who feel systems are broken and things cost too much.”</p> 
<p>And some Democrats — particularly Mamdani’s intraparty critics — are convinced it all fades, and GOP messaging continues apace. Alex Hoffman, the Democratic strategist and donor adviser, said: “He will become the bogeyman as soon as he starts implementing policy and saying ‘socialist’ as the sitting mayor.”</p> 
<p>But for Democrats, Friday’s friendly confab presented a possible path forward for handling the president.</p> 
<p>In a year when Democrats have struggled with how to engage Trump, in which at least one of them <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/us/politics/gretchen-whitmer-trump-democrats.html" target="_blank">hid behind a folder</a> in a White House meeting and left the base wondering about her 2028 sauce, Mamdani just put on a masterclass, Katz and other Democratic strategists said.</p> 
<p>Their theory of the case: In his meeting, he offered a template for handling Trump and Trumpism. Trump thinks Democrats are weak; Mamdani projected strength. His body language was neither embarrassed nor defensive. He did not moderate any of his positions. He didn’t grandstand, nor was he pugilistic.</p> 
<p>“Some Democrats made the decision that they had to reject Zohran completely if they didn’t agree with all of his policies,” Katz said. “That was a mistake. Zohran doesn’t have all the answers, but he does have a way at looking at situations that is different from typical Democrats in Washington. We need a lot of wins in 2026. Let’s work together to figure out how to get them.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House Democrats are jumping into an upcoming special election in Tennessee, dumping $1 million on an increasingly nationalized battle for a deep-red congressional seat as President Donald Trump gets involved in the race.</p> 
<p>House Majority PAC, the super PAC aligned with the lower chamber’s Democratic leadership, announced plans on Friday to spend $1 million on TV and digital ads to boost state Rep. Aftyn Behn. The Tennessee Democrat faces Republican Matt Van Epps next month in a district Trump won by 22 points in 2024.</p> 
<p>The spending represents a dramatic escalation for national Democrats, who have so far not spent significant cash on the long-shot race. Republicans have pumped far more — over $1.7 million — into it, including through the Trump-allied super PAC and the Club for Growth.</p> 
<p>This week, Trump and Kamala Harris waded into the contest, with the president hosting a telephone rally for Van Epps, while Harris appeared at a canvass launch for Behn on Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Privately, Democrats acknowledge it’s at best a narrow path to victory, but are voicing newfound optimism about their ability to win — or at least narrow past margins — on Republican turf after their consistent overperformance at the ballot box since Trump’s 2024 rout.</p> 
<p>The Tennessee race marks the House Democrats’ super PAC’s first special election involvement this cycle.</p> 
<p>Ahead of April special elections in Florida for two congressional seats in districts that Trump won by more than 30 points, Democratic candidates raised millions, mostly from online donors, but HMP and other Democratic super PACs steered clear. Republican-aligned super PACs spent more than $1 million on each race, and both Democratic candidates overperformed expectations, while still losing by roughly 15 points each.</p> 
<p>Democratic enthusiasm is also showing up in the Tennessee candidates’ fundraising totals.</p> 
<p>Behn raised just over $1 million since the start of October, according to a report her campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday. More than half the total was from donors giving less than $200. Van Epps raised $590,000 over the same period, with nearly half his funds coming from other political committees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s supporters are relaunching the political party he formed last year — potentially creating a pathway for him to run for president again in 2028 and offering a home for disaffected Kennedy-aligned voters who backed Republicans in 2024.</p> 
<p>A group of former Kennedy campaign staff, volunteers and backers have resurrected the We The People Party, the minor party Kennedy created to gain ballot access in some states during his long-shot independent presidential campaign.</p> 
<p>Levi Leatherberry, chair of the We The People Party and a former Kennedy campaign staffer, said the organization is aiming to drastically expand its ballot access in the next three years. The nascent campaign’s first target is New York, where a Kennedy-aligned gubernatorial candidate could put the party on the state’s ballot.</p> 
<p>“We only need to get to, like, 26 states for it to be as useful as it will be to any presidential candidate,” Leatherberry said of the party’s ballot access mission in an interview. “That's our focus. Building out, so we are actually useful, we're actually something to be reckoned with.”</p> 
<p>The revitalized party is hoping to fold in voters across the political spectrum who identify with the medical freedom movement — the same voters Kennedy targeted with his campaign, and the same voters President Donald Trump and Republicans are hoping to appease through the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.</p> 
<p>Leatherberry said he hopes the We The People Party will eventually be on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. But he hinted that the party could create leverage for Kennedy or another ideologically aligned candidate without gaining ballot access nationwide.</p> 
<p>“And yeah, we will be able to run national candidates,” he added.</p> 
<p>The reboot comes amid some tension between Kennedy and some of the president's most ardent supporters. Over the summer, Trump whisperer Laura Loomer <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/08/13/laura-loomers-next-target-00506395" target="_blank">attacked Kennedy and Stefanie Spear</a>, one of Kennedy's top aides at Health and Human Services and a key cog in his 2024 president run.</p> 
<p>Loomer claimed Spear was laying the groundwork for a 2028 presidential run for Kennedy. Kennedy defended Spear and called speculation he would run for president a "flat-out lie” and an attempt to “drive a wedge” between him and Trump. "Let me be clear: I am not running for president in 2028,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/15/rfk-jr-2028-election-00512168" target="_blank">he said in August</a>.</p> 
<p>Leatherberry said he has not spoken to Kennedy since taking over leadership of the party. Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment sent through a HHS spokesperson.</p> 
<p>Shortly after Kennedy abandoned his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of an independent bid, his campaign formed the We The People Party to circumnavigate cumbersome ballot access requirements for independent candidates. In some states, ballot access is significantly easier for candidates backed by a political party than for independents.</p> 
<p>Even though Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump before Election Day, his name appeared on the ballot in 31 states. In nine of those states, he appeared on a We The People Party line.</p> 
<p>Aides close to the president have been eager to keep Kennedy and his MAHA supporters in the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/26/rfk-jr-isnt-staying-in-his-lane-trump-is-thrilled-00310770" target="_blank">tent ahead of the midterms</a>, viewing them as crucial supporters who helped fuel Trump's victory in 2024. After a vaccine regulator had been forced out under pressure from Loomer, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles intervened and worked with Kennedy <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/14/rfk-trump-prasad-wiles-sarepta-loomer-maha-00508819" target="_blank">to get him reinstated</a>.</p> 
<p>In September, Leatherberry and other Kennedy supporters formally relaunched the We The People Party with an eye toward 2028. In a livestreamed organizing event, Leatherberry laid out a vision of gaining ballot access in dozens of states before the midterms and then endorsing a candidate in a national convention ahead of the next presidential election. That hypothetical candidate, Leatherberry said, would avoid the costly and litigious signature gathering process required of independent candidates in most states.</p> 
<p>“Our candidate will be on — free, day one,” Leatherberry <a href="https://x.com/Holden_Culotta/status/1972701621592203614?s=20" target="_blank">said in September</a>. “That means we can already nominate a presidential candidate, or national candidates, or local candidates for free.”</p> 
<p>Although Leatherberry hopes the party can recruit candidates in down-ballot races to expand the party’s influence quickly, thus far only one candidate has accepted a We The People Party endorsement: Larry Sharpe, a longtime Libertarian Party member who served as a Kennedy campaign surrogate in 2024 and is currently running his third consecutive campaign for governor of New York.</p> 
<p>New York has some of the most burdensome ballot access requirements in the country — it was the only state without any independent or third-party presidential candidates in 2024. Sharpe himself failed to make the ballot in 2022, running as a write-in candidate instead, and a judge ruled <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/rfk-jr-denied-ballot-access-in-new-york" target="_blank">Kennedy could not appear on New York’s ballot</a> last year due to his improperly listing his residency.</p> 
<p>But if Sharpe gets enough support in the gubernatorial race on the We The People Party line next year, it would make it possible for Kennedy — or anyone else — to run on that line in 2028.</p> 
<p>Sharpe defined the party as united in its distrust of both Republicans and Democrats, and the two-party system at large — without any core ideological underpinnings.</p> 
<p>“It is basically an anti-establishment party,” Sharpe said. “Anti-establishment is very vague.”</p> 
<p>Some of Kennedy's supporters have also extended that wariness toward the Trump administration. Some MAHA supporters have targeted Spear, Kennedy's close aide, and Wiles, the White House chief of staff, claiming both were undermining the movement. </p> 
<p>Kennedy <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/14/rfk-susie-wiles-stefanie-spear-trump-maha-00653250" target="_blank">flew to their defense</a>. “The MAHA movement has no better friend in Washington than [Wiles] who has supported every effort to end the chronic disease epidemic and restore health freedom to every American,” he wrote on social media earlier this month.</p> 
<p>Leatherberry also indicated interest in working with Tulsi Gabbard, the Democrat-turned-Trump campaign surrogate now serving as the Director of National Intelligence, and with Rep. Thomas Massie, the Libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican whose <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/thomas-massie-trump-jeffrey-epstein-00654214?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=1737ba36-e6d3-4962-b3e7-fbe23b4c3faa" target="_blank">repeated antagonization of Trump</a> has inspired a well-funded primary challenge.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Gabbard declined to comment. A spokesperson for Massie did not respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Leatherberry insisted he’s neutral on whether Kennedy should run for president, or whether the We The People party should endorse a presidential candidate in 2028. But Sharpe said he hopes Kennedy will run as a third-party candidate to carry the torch for the anti-establishment voters the party represents.</p> 
<p>“I think he kind of has to,” Sharpe said. “Unless someone else steps up. And at the moment, I don’t see anybody else stepping up.”</p>

   The Conversation 11-21-25 
 </politico-generic-embed>Driscoll is a veteran of the Iraq War, and as a result, has felt the effects of Pentagon decisions firsthand. He’s set out to reshape the U.S. Army and the Pentagon into an agile institution that can make better use of existing resources and channel the best practices of the private sector.</p> 
<p>“When you are creating defensive and offensive solutions, you have to think even 10 years out when the war really gets to its most catastrophic moment, ‘What are the very basic tools of warfare that can't be impacted by the enemy,” Driscoll said.</p> 
<p>In this week’s episode of The Conversation, Driscoll sits down with POLITICO’s Dasha Burns to delve into the future of warfare, his plans for reinvigorating the Army’s technology and the innovation spurred by conflict.</p> 
<p>“I think the best guess is if the United States entered a conflict with a peer in a couple of years, it would be a hybrid war where nearly every human being on the battlefield would be empowered and enabled with a digital tool,” Driscoll said. “I think we believe every infantryman in the United States Army will carry a drone with them into battle.”</p> 
<p>CNN "NewsNight" host Abby Phillip also joined Dasha to chat about her new book, “A Dream Deferred: Jesse Jackson and the Fight for Black Political Power,” Jackson’s influence on today’s political landscape and Phillip’s approach to her own roundtable show.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic National Committee took out $15 million in loans in October, according to a new filing with the Federal Election Commission submitted on Thursday.</p> 
<p>The national party committee framed the line of credit as an early investment to boost its candidates in New Jersey and Virginia earlier this month, and help build up state parties ahead of next year’s midterms. But the need for a loan still puts the DNC in sharp contrast with its GOP counterpart, the Republican National Committee, which was sitting on $86 million at the end of September.</p> 
<p>DNC Chair Ken Martin said the early investment was already helping the party win elections this month and position itself for what is to come.</p> 
<p>“We can’t win elections or fight back against Trump if the D.N.C. downsizes operations like it often does after a presidential cycle,” Martin said in a statement. “I made a bet that investing early would build power, rack up wins and rally supporters back to the table. That bet is paying off.”</p> 
<p>The loans were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/us/politics/dnc-loan-democrats.html" target="_blank">first reported by the New York Times</a>.</p> 
<p>The DNC also spent $16.9 million in October, the most it has spent in any single month this year. Driving that total was election-related spending: The national party spent over $6 million in New Jersey and Virginia to boost Democratic gubernatorial candidates, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Pennsylvania to help retain control of the state’s Supreme Court.</p> 
<p>Democrats won all those races.</p> 
<p>The national party committee also continues to send roughly $1 million each month to state party committees, and has a larger staff than it did at this time in 2017. It reported $18.3 million cash on hand at the end of October.</p> 
<p>The DNC has taken out loans before, although usually not this early in the cycle or of this magnitude all at once. In Trump’s first term, when the national party similarly faced fundraising lags, it reported $3.2 million in debt in November 2017 — this same time in the cycle — and more than $7 million a few months later, according to past FEC filings. The DNC has not reported more than $15 million in total debt since February 2014.</p> 
<p>But the national party has faced slower fundraising this year as many major donors <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/18/dnc-fundraising-donor-problems-midterms-00512473" target="_blank">have stayed on the sidelines</a> amid the DNC’s rebuilding efforts. The party’s fundraising numbers have improved slightly in recent months, and it raised $7.5 million from donors in October, not far off from the same month in 2021.</p> 
<p>The party committee’s cash totals were also hit earlier in the year as it paid off $18 million in lingering expenses from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Larry Summers once drove Cornel West out of Harvard in a very public fight. Now, Summers is back in the spotlight, and West can’t help but point out the irony.</p> 
<p>“There's a certain level of, not just hypocrisy, but a certain kind of chickens coming home to roost here,” West said in an interview Wednesday. “It's just sad that [Summers] has been preoccupied with the 11th commandment, ‘Thou shalt not get caught,’ rather than the other 10.”</p> 
<p>Last week, a tranche of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/here-are-9-of-the-most-shocking-revelations-in-the-latest-batch-of-epstein-documents-00649853" target="_blank">newly released emails</a> revealed that Summers had, over the course of a decade, corresponded with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including soliciting romantic advice as he pursued an extramarital affair. This week, Summers announced a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/larry-summers-steps-back-from-public-commitments-deeply-ashamed-by-epstein-revelations-00655712" target="_blank">retreat from public life</a>, including stepping away from <a href="http://politico.com/news/2025/11/19/larry-summers-steps-back-from-harvard-responsibilities-00661238" target="_blank">his teaching duties at Harvard</a>.</p> 
<p>Two decades ago, Summers chastised West for engaging in behavior that could be deemed “embarrassing” to the university or could interfere with his teaching, such as engaging in politics and recording a rap CD. The feud led to West’s resignation from Harvard.</p> 
<p>Since leaving Harvard in 2002, West, a public intellectual and activist, has taken faculty positions at Princeton and Union Theological Seminary; he published eight books and recorded a pair of hip-hop albums; he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/10/12/cornel-west-campaign-breakup-green-party-00121048" target="_blank">ran for president</a> in 2024.</p> 
<p>West, reached by telephone, seemed unsurprised by the revelations that Epstein considered himself Summers’ “wing man.” (At the time of correspondence, Epstein had already been sent to prison on state charges of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18.)</p> 
<p>“He's a neoliberal gangster, the way Trump's a neofascist gangster,” West said of Summers. “There's not a lot of integrity, honesty and decency. There is a lot of cold-heartedness and mean-spiritedness in both of them, even though they come from different ideological camps.”</p> 
<p>West, a devout Christian, quickly qualified his statement. “I don't say that in order to trash them,” he said. “I think that they both could be better human beings, but they don't seem to be interested in it too much.”</p> 
<p>West’s much-publicized feud with Summers began shortly after Summers’ arrival to Cambridge in 2001. Per West’s account, chronicled in his 2004 book "Democracy Matters," Summers, the newly installed Harvard president, summoned West — then a university professor in African American studies — to his office and chastised him for his political engagement, for recording a hip-hop CD, for contributing to grade inflation and for not producing philosophically rigorous academic work. He said West needed to “learn to be a good citizen at Harvard and focus on the academic needs of students, not the wages of workers,” per West’s account.</p> 
<p>Summers “questioned my academic accomplishments and my political affiliations,” West later wrote, “without bothering either to read any of my work or to develop an understanding of how it has been regarded by the wider academic community.”</p> 
<p>West claimed Summers apologized to him “more than once,” but Summers went on to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/04/us/black-scholars-mending-a-rift-with-harvard.html" target="_blank">tell The New York Times</a> he had not apologized. “I then knew just what an unprincipled power player I was dealing with,” West wrote, calling him “a bull in a china shop, a bully in a difficult and delicate situation, an arrogant man, and an ineffective leader.”</p> 
<p>Does that characterization still stand, two decades later? West thinks so. “The sad thing is that he, like Trump, has been able to get away with it for so long,” West said Wednesday. “Anytime you have that kind of gangsta behavior with impunity, no accountability, there's no answerability. He doesn't take responsibility up until now.”</p> 
<p>That responsibility came by way of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/larry-summers-steps-back-from-public-commitments-deeply-ashamed-by-epstein-revelations-00655712" target="_blank">a terse statement</a>, released Monday, in which Summers acknowledged he is “deeply ashamed” of his actions and decided he would “be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.” On Wednesday, he announced he would <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/larry-summers-steps-down-from-openai-00658779?utm_campaign=mb&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morning_brew" target="_blank">resign from OpenAI’s board</a>.</p> 
<p>When West spoke to POLITICO Wednesday evening, Summer’s resignation from his teaching duties at Harvard <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/20/summers-leaves-teaching-at-harvard/" target="_blank">were not yet public</a>, even though the university was facing increasing pressure — including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/elizabeth-warren-larry-summers-harvard-epstein" target="_blank">from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)</a>, a former Harvard Law professor — to dump him.</p> 
<p>West wasn’t so convinced that Summers should have been ousted from Harvard.</p> 
<p>“I think people should be able to teach at Harvard who have a variety of different degrees of moral character,” West said. “I don't think you have to be St. Francis of Assisi or have the spirit of Fannie Lou Hamer to teach at Harvard. … I always give Brother Summers, and anybody else, a chance to just choose to be a better person. He’s still alive. He can bounce back.”</p> 
<p>It’s a “sad thing,” West continued, “when you have professors who are willing to hang out with gangsters like Epstein, and therefore, all of the criticism that's moral and spiritual he deserves. I don't know that the inference means that he can just no longer teach at Harvard or any other place. I'm a little reluctant to move in that direction. I tend to come out of the Black freedom struggle, which says, lift every voice, which makes me a very strong libertarian.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Barack Obama is embracing his role as mentor-in-chief, huddling with nearly three dozen freshman House Democrats at the Capitol Hill home of Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) at a Wednesday night event hosted by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p> 
<p>The event — moderated by Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) — saw Obama buck up Democrats and offer insights on surviving Republican majorities.</p> 
<p>“I get feeling discouraged sometimes,” Obama told the room over soda, water, crackers and crudite, according to excerpts provided by his office to POLITICO. “I get feeling worn out, tired, and embattled. But in our second term, Denis McDonough, my chief of staff, used to pass out stickers based on a conversation that he and I had had that talked about, ‘we do not succumb to cynicism — cynicism is our enemy.’ And it's pervasive in this town.”</p> 
<p>He added that McDonough had stickers printed that read: “fight cynicism<i>.”</i></p> 
<p>“And that, I think, is our most important battle, right?” Obama said. “We don't give into that, and then we're going to be able to figure out the same stuff.”</p> 
<p>Obama emphasized to attendees that he had “been in your shoes. Because when I was — everybody remembers the Democratic National Convention in 2004 — when you were. …well, you were in elementary school” — a line that drew laughter.</p> 
<p>Obama also compared that moment more than 20 years ago to this one in the Democratic Party’s search for a path out of the wilderness.</p> 
<p>“But what people don't recall is that John Kerry lost that election,” Obama said. “And we didn't control the House, and we did not control the Senate. And Tom Daschle, who was then the Democratic leader of the Senate, lost, which is unheard of. And Karl Rove, who was the chief architect of George Bush's campaigns and political career was – could be found on all the TV stations, talking about the ‘permanent Republican majority’ that had been created.”</p> 
<p>The former president continued, describing a similar sense of despair in 2004 that Democrats felt after 2024 when President Donald Trump swept all seven battleground states and decisively beat former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p> 
<p>But it ultimately turned out well for Democrats two decades ago, Obama said.</p> 
<p>“And two years later, Nancy Pelosi was the first woman speaker of the House of Representatives. And four years later, somehow, I ended up being president. The reason I tell you that is not for you to, you know, feel complacent,” he said. “It's to indicate that the work that you are doing right now, the investment you're making, the focus that you're applying, the issues that you are developing, the interactions that you're having with your constituencies. All that is creating the momentum and the opportunity for change.”</p> 
<p>Obama took five questions on several topics, including on lessons learned on the Affordable Care Act fight. On that point, he told Rep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.) that he overestimated Republicans’ willingness to work with him, saying he could have learned that lesson quicker.</p> 
<p>“We wasted a lot of time trying to engage the ideas of Republicans on a good faith basis,” Obama said.</p> 
<p>Obama lingered with McBride in a photo line amid the event, according to a person familiar with the gathering granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation, and has complimented her on her high-profile media appearances and her messaging, including her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-sarah-mcbride.html" target="_blank"><u>interview with Ezra Klein</u></a> earlier this year.</p> 
<p>Obama has never been far from the campaign trail over the last year, and his post-presidency has focused on boosting the next generation of Democratic leaders. He stumped for candidates in New Jersey’s and Virginia’s off-year elections, and has had <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/29/obama-democrats-trump-talarico-00535507" target="_blank"><u>&nbsp;phone calls</u></a> with incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Texas Senate candidate James Talarico, among others.</p> 
<p>Ahead of the 2024 elections, he hosted several small group sessions in his office with the goal of offering a sounding board, according to a person close to him granted anonymity to speak candidly, including with a group of Obama administration alumni, emerging voices within the party and in-cycle senators.</p> 
<p>This is only the second time in his post-presidency that Obama has met with freshman Democrats: He also did so <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/26/politics/obama-meets-with-house-freshman" target="_blank"><u>in 2019</u></a>. Obama spoke on the last episode of the Marc Maron podcast recently of his “move from player to coach” in the Democratic Party.</p> 
<p>“His goal,” a person close to the former president said, “is to build a sustainable Democratic Party that can survive without him.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats believe they have an opening to reclaim Latino voters that fled the party last year — but a prominent Latino-focused group argued the party needs to present a message that’s more than just anti-Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>Trump’s approval among Latino voters has tapped new lows, continuing a months-long plunge in support among the voting bloc Republicans are relying on to sustain their strongholds in the midterms, according to polling sponsored by Latino voter group Somos Votantes and its affiliated PAC that was shared first with POLITICO.</p> 
<p>Trump’s personal favorability is underwater by 26 points among Latino voters, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12IhI9kAQPbOjwl-AcBcT0c5sVNTn8gzA/view" target="_blank">according to a survey</a> conducted by GSG. The drop continues a sustained slump among the demographic that has only worsened since the beginning of the year, and sank another 6 points <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/somos-poll-00563264" target="_blank">since September</a>.</p> 
<p>But the new polling offers an equally grim outlook on Trump’s handling of the economy — an issue the administration has touted as one of their top achievements and a ballot issue both sides of the aisle have identified as a main decider in top races. Trump is underwater by 30 points on the issue, dipping from 38 percent approval in May to 34 percent in November.</p> 
<p>“The reality is that Donald Trump promised to slash prices on day one,” said Melissa Morales, Somos’ president. “That was something that he repeated over and over and that he certainly hasn't delivered on. What we need to see as we move into next year is that Latino voters are looking for a positive economic vision to believe in. The side that can deliver that in a real way will win over Latino voters.”</p> 
<p>Latino voters who swung toward Trump in 2024 <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/latino-voters-trump-democrats-00646300" target="_blank">rebounded back toward Democrats</a> in this cycle’s off-year races, with the Democratic candidates in both New Jersey and Virginia winning heavily Latino areas. Democrats have heralded these wins as a sign that their messaging on affordability offers the party a chance to harness Latino voters back to the party base, a takeaway Morales said the survey reaffirms.</p> 
<p>“The Democratic message can’t just be anti-Trump,” she said. “It has to be providing Latino voters with a positive economic vision for the future and giving them something to believe in.”</p> 
<p>“That's the sort of vision that Latino voters are looking for right now, and that if Democrats want to win Latino voters back over, that they will have to provide,” she added.</p> 
<p>Republicans have largely dismissed the party’s recent struggles with Latinos, saying the GOP will bounce back by the midterms. They point to their inroads with Latino voters in recent cycles, noting Trump’s historic gains in 2024 as well as a string of wins in some majority-Latino congressional districts.</p> 
<p>“Democrats have ignored Hispanic communities over the past nine years while millions of working families rejected their radical, socialist agenda,” Christian Martinez, the National Republican Congressional Committee’s national Hispanic press secretary, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/11/latino-voters-trump-democrats-00646300" target="_blank">told POLITICO last week</a>. “Republicans will continue to earn the support of Hispanic voters because we are working to deliver opportunity, security, and a better life.”</p> 
<p>A majority of Latino voters in the Somos poll overwhelmingly reported extreme concern with the rising cost of living at 64 percent. The polling suggested that Democrats could capitalize on this concern, with Latinos largely holding Republicans responsible for the state of the economy: 45 percent say they blame the GOP for the rising cost of living, compared to 24 percent who blamed Democrats.</p> 
<p>“Latino voters are genuinely worried about making sure that they make ends meet,” said pollster Rosa Mendoza. “And I think Republicans having that be one of their core messages as they were heading into the election in 2024, and yet being very much on the back burner — it’s not helping them.”</p> 
<p>Global Strategy Group conducted the national poll of 800 Latino registered voters from Nov. 4 to 12. It has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A panel of federal judges has blocked Texas’ newly redrawn congressional map — which made five districts in the state more favorable to Republicans — saying the plan appeared to be an illegal race-based gerrymander.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1150387/gov.uscourts.txwd.1150387.1437.0.pdf" target="_blank"><u>2-1 ruling</u></a>, the court ordered Texas to rely instead on the boundaries legislators drew in 2021. The new map, the majority concluded, appears likely to be unconstitutional and was drawn at the urging of the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>“The map ultimately passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor — the 2025 Map — achieved all but one of the racial objectives that DOJ demanded,” U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Galveston-based Trump appointee, wrote for the panel majority.</p> 
<p>The decision is a massive blow in the White House’s push to redistrict across the country. Texas’ five-seat map represented the biggest gains for the GOP through redrawing. Texas appealed the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court later Tuesday. </p> 
<p>Brown was joined by U.S. District Judge David Guaderrama, an El Paso-based Obama appointee. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith, a Houston-based Reagan appointee, dissented but did not immediately release an opinion explaining his reasoning.</p> 
<p>The majority repeatedly derided the Justice Department’s effort to goad Texas into targeting the four districts with non-white majorities — known as “coalition districts.” That effort, Brown said, began on July 7, with <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/7-7-2025-DOJ-Letter-re-Unconstitutional-Race-Based-Congressional-Distric.pdf" target="_blank"><u>a letter from DOJ’s Civil Rights Division</u></a> that was “challenging to unpack … because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors.”</p> 
<p>According to the court, the letter selected the four districts “based entirely on their racial makeup” and was the key factor that spurred Texas Republicans to take up the extraordinary redistricting effort. The bulk of Brown’s 160-page opinion delves into the mindset of the state lawmakers and advisers who drew the new maps, suggesting that their motives clearly aligned with DOJ’s race-based push and that their characterization of the new maps as based only on race-blind partisanship were not believable.</p> 
<p>The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request to comment. </p> 
<p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office, in a statement, pushed back against the ruling and suggestion that the newly drawn maps are unfair or biased. </p> 
<p>"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings," he stated. "This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.”</p> 
<p>The court also downplayed the notion that scrapping Texas’ new maps would lead to chaos in the midterm elections. Though the judges acknowledged that it would scramble the calculus of some candidates who had announced their bids for office based on the new maps, they said filing deadlines had not yet elapsed.</p> 
<p>“Simply put, the 2026 congressional election is not underway,” Brown wrote. “In any event, any disruption that would happen here is attributable to the Legislature, not the Court. The Legislature—not the Court—set the timetable for this injunction. The Legislature—not the Court—redrew Texas’s congressional map weeks before precinct-chair and candidate-filing periods opened. The State chose to ‘toy with its election laws close to’ the 2026 congressional election, though that is certainly its prerogative.”</p> 
<p>The state’s candidate filing deadline is rapidly approaching: Dec. 8. Courts and state election officials are generally hesitant to move deadlines, but they can if necessary.</p> 
<p>Two other states — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/12/missouri-map-redistricting-midterms-00557990" target="_blank"><u>Missouri and</u></a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/north-carolina-new-house-district-gop-gerrymander-00618225" target="_blank"><u>North Carolina</u></a> — have passed maps that net Republicans one red-leaning seat each. And in Ohio, which was legally required to redraw its maps this year, Republicans and Democrats cut a deal that made <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/ohio-redistricting-gerrymander-new-map-00631254" target="_blank"><u>two Democratic-held seats redder</u></a>, but Democrats insist both will remain competitive in 2026.</p> 
<p>Democrats have also filed legal challenges in North Carolina and Missouri, and they have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/09/democrats-hopes-courts-redistricting-fight-00551030" target="_blank"><u>long prioritized the courts</u></a> as a way to stop Republican gerrymandering efforts.</p> 
<p>Without the Texas map in place, Democrats’ five-seat pickup in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/05/prop50-newsom-strategy-00630313" target="_blank"><u>California through Proposition 50 fully thwarts</u></a> the GOP’s gains so far, though other red states are still being pressured by the White House to take up the issue ahead of next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>The decision is likely to put even more pressure on Indiana Republicans, who are being asked to draw a new map that would give the GOP two more red-leaning districts. So far, Indiana GOP Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray has resisted <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/14/indiana-redistricting-trump-vance-00652288" target="_blank"><u>calls to alter maps in the state</u></a>, making a path forward very difficult for the redistricting effort.</p> 
<p>Lawmakers in the Hoosier State are already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/17/trump-set-to-primary-indiana-republicans-who-oppose-redistricting-00654352" target="_blank"><u>facing threats of primaries</u></a> from the White House after Bray said his caucus did not have the votes to pass a new map, and President Donald Trump said Republican Gov. Mike Braun “must produce on this” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115570749579575260" target="_blank"><u>in a social media post Tuesday</u></a>.</p> 
<p>The ruling in Texas is the latest in a saga that took the summer by storm, when Texas Democrats decamped from the state in an effort to stop the new map from being passed.</p> 
<p>On Tuesday, the Democrats who led that effort hailed the court’s decision.</p> 
<p>“Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans’ voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing,” Texas Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is unleashing his anger at Indiana Senate Republicans for not backing the GOP redistricting effort, posting his displeasure three times to Truth Social in the last 24 hours and calling President Pro Tempore Rod Bray a “Total RINO.”</p> 
<p>“In the entire United States of America, Republican or Democrat, only Indiana “Republican” State Senator Rod Bray, a Complete and Total RINO, is opposed to redistricting for purposes of gaining additional Seats in Congress,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115567070909453272" target="_blank">posted Trump</a> on Monday afternoon, who has seen Republican lawmakers in four states now reject his mid-cycle redistricting scheme. In another Monday post, Trump said competitors were <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115567081810209795" target="_blank">lining up</a> to primary Bray. </p> 
<p>Bray is not the only Republican in Indiana who doesn’t back redistricting. On Monday, Indiana state Sen. Blake Doriot of Goshen issued a statement saying that he was a Trump supporter but that he opposed redistricting. </p> 
<p>"I have long been a Trump supporter, and I want President Trump to continue to be successful with a Republican-led House so he can continue fixing our woke colleges, fighting illegal immigration and crime, and encouraging us to speak about our great nation and be proud of who we are as Americans – not apologize for it,” Doriot said in a statement. </p> 
<p>The news comes as Trump is set to issue a retributive endorsement as early as Monday against one of a handful Indiana Senate Republicans who opposes the White House’s mid-cycle redistricting plan.</p> 
<p>Among the holdouts targeted by the White House: Republican state Sen. Jim Buck of Kokomo, who is facing a primary from Tipton County Commissioner Tracey Powell. Trump could back Powell Monday, according to a person familiar with his thinking speaking exclusively with POLITICO, following through on MAGA’s and White House allies' long-running threats to primary opponents of their mid-decade redistricting effort intended to protect their slim House majority in the midterms next year.</p> 
<p>Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115565882166681770" target="_blank">posted on Truth Social</a> Monday morning that he “will be strongly endorsing against any State Senator or House member from the Great State of Indiana that votes against the Republican Party, and our Nation, by not allowing for Redistricting for Congressional seats in the United States House of Representatives as every other State in our Nation is doing, Republican or Democrat.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for Buck did not respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>The White House is extending invitations to Indiana lawmakers for Oval Office visits. The latest invitation accepted is by State Sen. Scott Baldwin, who confirmed the invite in a phone interview. </p> 
<p>Baldwin has already announced his support for redistricting.</p> 
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Trump’s post came after Bray announced on Friday that the chamber will not convene in December to redraw maps, drawing Trump’s ire to and a threat to withdraw his support for Bray, State Sen. Greg Goode and Gov. Mike Braun. Goode <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/indiana-republican-trump-redistricting-swatted-00654098" target="_blank">was the victim of a swatting incident</a> over the weekend.</p> 
<p>Bray said his decision was influenced by the lack of votes supporting the measure, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/16/trump-indiana-gop-redistricting-primary-00653932" target="_blank">Trump on Sunday</a> argued that meant Braun was not doing enough to secure GOP support.</p> 
<p>“Considering that Mike wouldn’t be Governor without me (Not even close!), is disappointing!” Trump said in a post to Truth Social. “Any Republican that votes against this important redistricting, potentially having an impact on America itself, should be PRIMARIED.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another member of the conservative Heritage Foundation has resigned following a video posted by the organization’s president defending Tucker Carlson’s interview with Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/100057876226212/posts/1235634391709090/?mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=xmx7HNfBMTuj2T4j#" target="_blank">In a post to Facebook</a>, board member Robert P. George said he can no longer remain part of the foundation without a “full retraction” of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/30/heritage-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-00631200" target="_blank">video released last month</a> by the organization’s president, Kevin Roberts.</p> 
<p>“Although Kevin publicly apologized for some of what he said in the video, he could not offer a full retraction of its content. So, we reached an impasse,” George said.</p> 
<p>Carlson’s interview with Fuentes — who has previously expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler — received <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/31/mcconnell-heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson-00631510" target="_blank">widespread condemnation</a> for antisemitism, and the aftermath has exposed fault lines among conservatives.</p> 
<p>In his Oct. 30 video, Roberts denounced the "venomous coalition” criticizing both Fuentes and Carlson, adding that Carlson is a “close friend.” He said that though he disagrees with and even “abhors” things Fuentes said, he did not believe in “canceling” him or Carlson. On Sunday, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnyf-oHslkc" target="_blank">also defended Carlson</a>, telling reporters “you can’t tell him who to interview.”</p> 
<p>Fuentes, a well-known provocateur on the right, has previously said that “organized Jewry” is leading to the disappearance of white culture.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSzreQWCRPg&amp;t=601s" target="_blank">Roberts later said</a> he “didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy,” and that his video script was written by an aide who has since resigned.</p> 
<p>George on Monday said that Roberts is a “good man” who acknowledged a “serious mistake.”</p> 
<p>“What divided us was a difference of opinion about what was required to rectify the mistake,” George added.</p> 
<p>A spokesman for the Heritage Foundation confirmed George's resignation in a statement to POLITICO, thanking him for his service and calling him a "good man" before defending Roberts. </p> 
<p>"Under the leadership of Dr. Roberts, Heritage remains resolute in building an America where freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society flourish. We are strong, growing, and more determined than ever to fight for our Republic," the spokesman said. </p> 
<p>George, the McCormick professor of jurisprudence and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University, had been a Heritage trustee since 2019, according to the foundation’s website.</p> 
<p>His resignation is one of several in light of Roberts' video, including at least five members of the foundation’s antisemitism task force, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heritage-foundation-kevin-roberts-tucker-carlson-interview-nick-fuentes/" target="_blank">according to CBS News</a>.</p> 
<p>“I pray that Heritage’s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is “created equal” and “endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,” George said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Greg Goode, who Trump posted was a “RINO” he was “Very disappointed in” Sunday was targeted hours later by what Vigo County Sheriff Derek Fell called a “swatting” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VigoSheriff/posts/%F0%9D%97%A6%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%98%82%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%B5%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BB-%F0%9D%97%A9%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%B4%F0%9D%97%BC-%F0%9D%97%96%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%98%82%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86-%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%B4%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%98%81-%F0%9D%97%99%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%97%B2-%F0%9D%97%96%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%B9%F0%9D%97%B9-%F0%9D%97%B3%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BF-%F0%9D%97%A6%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%98%83%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B2on-sunday-november-16th-ar/1144384521144503/" target="_blank">in a statement</a>.</p> 
<p>Despite Trump’s social media post insinuating otherwise, Goode has not publicly announced his position on redistricting.</p> 
<p>Fell said that around 5 p.m. Sunday “an email was sent to the Terre Haute Police Department advising harm had been done to persons inside a home, located in southeastern Vigo County,” Fell said. “This information was immediately relayed to the Sheriffs Office, at which point deputies responded to the home, which was the home of Senator Greg Goode. Attempts were initially unsuccessful to raise anyone at the residence, but ultimately contact was made with persons inside the home.”</p> 
<p>Fell added that Goode and others “were secure, safe, and unharmed. Investigation showed that this was a prank or false email (also known as ‘swatting’).”</p> 
<p>In a statement, <a href="https://x.com/gregoryjgoode/status/1990220564498108845?s=20" target="_blank">Goode said</a> he and his family were "victims," and thanked Fell and Terre Haute Police Chief Kevin Barrett for their "professionalism."</p> 
<p>The news comes as efforts to redistrict have ground to a halt in Indiana on Friday, after Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/14/indiana-redistricting-trump-vance-00652288?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank">refused to reconvene the chamber</a> to redraw congressional maps in favor of Republicans.</p> 
<p>The president threatened earlier Sunday that a list of Senate Republicans resistant to gerrymandering the state would be "released to the public later this afternoon," which so far seems to have not materialized by this evening.</p> 
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.</p> 
<p>Earlier this month, Goode held a <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/03/indiana-republican-senator-undecided-holds-redistricting-town-hall-terre-haute-vigo-county/86949497007/" target="_blank">town hall in Terre Haute</a> on redistricting, and 71 people spoke out against it and nobody spoke for it.</p> 
<p>On Tuesday, Indiana lawmakers are expected to convene at the Indiana Statehouse for organization day, a largely ceremonial and administrative event kicking off next year’s session. Already, pro-redistricting advocates have announced a statehouse rally calling for redistricting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“All I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.</p> 
<p>The president continued to share several posts lambasting Taylor Greene on Truth Social into Friday night — including reposting comments that called the representative "a cheap political football," a "sellout" and another that said her "political future just ended," all in the span of a couple minutes.</p> 
<p>The outburst marked a notable fissure in the MAGA coalition that vaulted Trump to office and has helped him carry out his agenda but has fractured in recent months, particularly over files related to Epstein.</p> 
<p>Greene had been an unusually pointed critic of Trump, saying he should spend less time on overseas travel and foreign affairs and more addressing domestic issues such as the looming expiration of Obamacare subsidies that will cause health insurance for many to soar.</p> 
<p>But Epstein appears to be the main factor in the breach. Greene and MAGA figures have long called for the government to release files from the investigation, something Trump had also appeared to support until he returned to office.</p> 
<p>Congress is expected to vote Tuesday on <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/12/house-epstein-files-vote-00647392" target="_blank">legislation to force the release of federal files</a> related to Epstein. After Trump denounced her, Greene <a href="https://x.com/repmtg/status/1989518703507963940?s=46" target="_blank"><u>said in a social media post</u></a> of her own that she had sent him a text message about the late sex offender, saying that’s what appeared to set him off.</p> 
<p>“It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” she said. “But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”</p> 
<p>She added: “I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s criticism of Greene comes at a politically fraught moment for Republicans, who are feeling squeamish after a crushing off-season election cycle in which Democrats swept all major races in part by messaging on the shutdown and affordability. Democrats are hoping this momentum will carry them into the midterms, when they hope to regain control of the House.</p> 
<p>The president said that a viable Republican who runs against Greene — who he now sees as “Far Left” — in a primary election next year would receive his endorsement.</p> 
<p>“I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day. I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics,” he said. “If the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support.”</p> 
<p>Trump has used Truth Social to level similarly harsh attacks against Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) who, like Greene, has skewered Trump and other Republican leaders by calling for the full release of the Epstein files and pushing to cut back presidential war powers. Last month, Trump encouraged Ed Gallrein, a retired Navy Seal, to run against Massie during the primary elections next year, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) later said he would help Massie clinch a victory.</p> 
<p>“Did Thomas Massie, sometimes referred to as Rand Paul Jr., because of the fact that he always votes against the Republican Party, get married already???” Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115551054294277065" target="_blank"><u>wrote on Truth Social.</u></a> “Boy, that was quick! No wonder the Polls have him at less than an 8% chance of winning the Election. Anyway, have a great life Thomas and (?). His wife will soon find out that she’s stuck with a LOSER!”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INDIANAPOLIS — President Donald Trump’s effort to force mid-decade redistricting suffered a major setback Friday, after Indiana’s GOP state Senate leader declared the chamber will not convene in December to redraw maps.</p> 
<p>In response, Trump's team has begun summoning Indiana lawmakers to meet with the president in the Oval Office as early as next week, according to two sources familiar with the request, including one who had fielded an invite over the phone Friday.</p> 
<p>"Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state's congressional maps,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said in a statement, after conducting a private test vote on Friday afternoon with his caucus. “Today, I'm announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December."</p> 
<p>It’s a massive blow to the White House’s efforts to shore up a Republican House majority next year via redistricting, and comes from a state Trump easily won last November. It marks the fourth state where efforts have stalled despite pressure from Trump and his political team.</p> 
<p>Bray’s announcement on Friday immediately incensed those in Trump’s orbit.</p> 
<p>“Our party can no longer afford to harbor these gutless, self-serving traitors who stab us in the back while accomplishing absolutely nothing,” <a href="https://x.com/alexbruesewitz/status/1989423360816681063?s=20" target="_blank"><u>Trump ally Alex Bruesewitz said on X</u></a>. “The entire MAGA movement will be mobilizing to Indiana to PRIMARY and OUST every last RINO blocking these essential reforms to RESCUE our nation, this will include the totally clueless and weak State Senate President.”</p> 
<p>Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana several times and expended political capital on the Hoosier state effort, flying twice on Air Force Two here to court lawmakers, and he had welcomed Indiana lawmakers to the White House. Trump himself entertained Bray and state House Speaker Todd Huston in the Oval Office to discuss the matter in August.</p> 
<p>Vance’s office did not immediately comment on the development. </p> 
<p>And while Republican-backed efforts continue to stall across the country, Democrats are beginning to ramp up their efforts. After four GOP states redrew nine red-leaning seats — starting with Texas — California voters approved a ballot measure that could net Democrats five seats of their own. Virginia is poised to follow suit with two potential seats, and the party is ramping up its pressure on Maryland and Illinois.</p> 
<p>It’s no sure thing yet — as some states are expected to move forward with redistricting in January — but the battle is looking increasingly likely to end in a draw.</p> 
<p>GOP Gov. Mike Braun, who had called for a special session but cannot force a vote on the issue, called on the state’s Senate to “do the right thing and show up to vote for fair maps.”</p> 
<p>“Hoosiers deserve to know where their elected officials stand on important issues,” Braun said in a statement.</p> 
<p>One person close to the redistricting process, granted anonymity to discuss conversations that are not yet public, said that Bray’s description of the vote tally is not accurate.</p> 
<p>“The House has the votes and the Senate is very close to having the votes,” the person said, adding that Bray “claims to be protecting his members, but the reality is that he’s hurting his members and the voters who elect them by betraying Republicans and lying to the public.”</p> 
<p>Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.) — whose seat was likely to be redrawn — hailed the decision on Friday.</p> 
<p>“Prayer, people, and partnerships power change,” Carson said. “Hoosiers do things differently. We’re about collaboration, not division. We’re about independent thinking — not taking orders from Washington. I want to thank Senator Bray and all the Republican and Democratic members of the Indiana Statehouse who held firm on Hoosier values. This is a win for all of us."</p> 
<p>Outside of Indiana, other GOP efforts are also struggling. In Kansas, Republican state House Speaker Dan Hawkins said earlier this month that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/04/kansas-redistricting-push-trump-00636758" target="_blank"><u>his chamber does not have the two-thirds vote required</u></a> to call a special session over Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Hawkins responded to the disagreement in his caucus by stripping leadership posts from holdouts and has vowed to take the issue up during the January regular session.</p> 
<p>Efforts in Nebraska and New Hampshire have also stalled, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/28/the-republicans-thwarting-the-white-houses-redistricting-hopes-00625911" target="_blank"><u>thanks to reluctant Republicans</u></a> unafraid of White House threats.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats are trying to blunt the Republican advantage on the widely popular no-tax-on-tips policy as both parties look to strengthen their appeal to the working class ahead of the midterms.</p> 
<p>The most intense of these battles is unfolding in Nevada, where five percent of workers earn tips, about double the national rate. Republicans are looking to flip three of the state’s four congressional districts — which include some regions where the tourism and gambling economy dominates. They have already spent millions on ads targeting Nevada Democrats for voting against <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_1" target="_blank">the GOP megabill</a> that included the tax deduction for tipped workers, which was pushed by President Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>"Everyone knows that that was a massively influential message by the president," said Robert Uithoven, a GOP strategist who is running the campaign of Lydia Dominguez, one of the Republicans vying for the party's nomination to take on Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/307341" data-person-id="307341">Susie Lee</a> (D-Nev.). Uithoven noted that Trump won Lee's district — which he said includes a large number of workers employed on the Vegas Strip — and carried the state.</p> 
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, have blitzed through Las Vegas, Reno and the state’s other tourist hotspots, proclaiming that Republicans generated no such boon for tipped workers there. </p> 
<p>“They’re going to see it, they’re going to feel it. They’re already feeling it,” Lee said in an interview with POLITICO. “It's a raw deal for tipped earners, because it's not permanent, and it's so much smaller than what the wealthiest Americans got out of that bill.”</p> 
<p>The skirmishing comes as both parties look to control the narrative on the affordability of groceries, housing and other staples, along with the state of household incomes — issues expected to have outsized influence on next year’s midterms.</p> 
<p>Moreover, Republicans are trying to better market the omnibus legislation they passed this summer, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/03/congress/trump-megabill-rebrand-midterms-00541138" target="_blank">which hasn’t proven as popular as they hoped</a>. They are zeroing in on individual portions of the megabill that are broadly appealing to working-class voters, and deductions for tipped workers could score the party much-needed political gains after a crushing off-year election defeat last week.</p> 
<p>“Nevadans know who put more money back in their pockets, and it wasn’t the Democrat frauds who are trying to claim credit,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP’s campaign arm. “Out of touch Democrats <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/193559" data-person-id="193559">Steven Horsford</a>, <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/member/66866" data-person-id="66866">Dina Titus</a> and Susie Lee can’t lie their way out of this one.”</p> 
<p>Nevada Democrats bristle at Republicans’ characterization of them as followers — not leaders — on tax breaks for tipped workers. They note that the idea was a seminal part of their 2024 campaigns, and chastised their opponents for failing to back an alternative measure, which they said would have offered tipped workers more meaningful breaks, and the elimination of subminimum wages. </p> 
<p>The bill fizzled out in Congress, which — according to Horsford, who drew up the measure — indicates the GOP’s efforts are disingenuous.</p> 
<p>“My bill, the <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_1314?q=%22TIPS+Act%22" target="_blank">TIPS Act</a>, does all the things that the tipped workers asked for because I asked them what they wanted included in the bill as I worked on it. That’s where the Republicans got their bill wrong from the beginning. They listened to one person, Donald Trump, and not the workers,” he said.</p> 
<p>Titus, who has introduced <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_119_HR_3662" target="_blank">legislation on the issue</a> that would also raise the regular minimum wage, said: “Exempting tips from income taxes is only part of the solution to increasing the wages of tipped workers." </p> 
<p>The Democrats' counteroffensive is part of a larger portrait Democrats have spent months drawing up in hopes of demonstrating that the GOP’s promise of beefier refund checks next filing season will be moot for the working class. They’ve pointed to several statistics: Over a third of tipped workers<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240624/no-tax-tips-act-background-tipped-workers" target="_blank">do not make enough money to pay federal income taxes</a>. Two in five tipped workers<a href="https://x.com/gidlukens/status/1938336090215137739?s=46&amp;t=CXMzot_Mnt2cwoVN3IVm7w" target="_blank">rely on Medicaid and other public assistance</a> that the GOP has slashed or could let expire. </p> 
<p>And they note that the tax break will lapse in three years unless Congress extends it, while the cuts to public benefits would be permanent.</p> 
<p>“D.C. Republicans are giving temporary crumbs to working families,” said Lindsay Reilly, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party’s House campaign arm. “Meanwhile, millions of families are at risk of losing their health care, hundreds of hospitals could close, and countless Americans could lose their jobs — all to pay for permanent tax cuts for billionaires.”</p> 
<p>Nevada Democrats also say Trump’s coarse diplomatic relations with Canada have eroded the state’s tourism economy, which is heavily dependent on Canadian visitation, and squandered any windfalls the GOP tax deduction on tips could generate.</p> 
<p>“When you have less tourism there, there’s less cars to park, there’s less rooms to clean, there’s less tables to serve,” said Lee, who represents Nevada’s third district, which includes southern Las Vegas. “That’s less tipped income.”</p> 
<p>There’s perhaps no group more important for the parties to win over on the issue in Nevada than Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents the state’s hospitality workers. But in the union’s eyes, both sides are flailing.</p> 
<p>In late October, the union sent a letter to Treasury and the IRS rebuking the limitations of the tax cut in the GOP megabill and asking for the same things Democrats have pushed for: a permanent extension of the tip tax deduction that would also cover automatic gratuities and eliminate the subminimum wage. Neither the agencies nor congressional Republicans have indicated they’re willing to offer concessions since then, to the union’s frustration, said Ted Pappageorge, its secretary-treasurer.</p> 
<p>But that shouldn’t serve as a reprieve for House Democrats, even if they earned the union’s endorsement last year, he continued.</p> 
<p>“There has to be a real fight with the Democratic Party about a message that is very clear that we are going to tackle the cost of living and support working class, kitchen table voters,” Pappageorge said. “We’ve been very clear, we’re going to talk to Republicans, Democrats and independents, and we’re going to run our own members because we don’t see Democrats focusing on working class issues in a way that is going to win in the midterms.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rep. Seth Moulton (D–Mass.) is not one to shy away from criticism of his own party. He made waves in the past when he insisted that the Democrats’ approach to dialogue on transgender issues was stifling. Moulton has also been vocal about the need for generational change in an aging Washington.</p> 
<p>This time, the Massachusetts congressman is speaking out about the deal that ended the longest government shutdown in history and how Senate Democrats missed an opportunity to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies.<br></p><p>“If Republicans were somehow gaining advantage here, if the polling was shifting in their favor, if they had done well in the elections last week, then I might say, ’Okay, I get it. It doesn't seem like this strategy is working, so let's give up,’” Moulton said. “But Schumer has just snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.”</p> 
<p>Moulton is a veteran who served four tours in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer. He’s also challenging Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey for his seat in the 2026 midterms — a feat that former Rep. Joe Kennedy III attempted and lost in 2020.</p> 
<p>“Senator Markey is a good guy,” says Moulton. “He served the country for half a century. I mean, he's been in office longer than I've been alive. He and I agree on many of the issues. He says the right things, he has great press releases, but how much has he actually gotten done?”</p> 
<p>In this week’s episode of The Conversation, Moulton talks with POLITICO’s Dasha Burns about how he believes Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is failing his party, why age needs to be a major consideration for lawmakers and how Senate Democrats could have done more to guarantee access to affordable health care.</p> 
<p>Plus, POLITICO’s Senior Congressional Editor Mike DeBonis joins Dasha to discuss how the shutdown finally came to an end, which party ended up better off afterwards and how this event may shape Congress in the year to come.</p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report misstated when former Rep. Joe Kennedy III has run against Sen. Ed Markey. It was in 2020. This report also previously misstated former Rep. Joe Kennedy III's title. He is a former congressman.]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In breaking ranks to end the federal government shutdown this week, Nevada’s two Democratic senators showcased the shifting politics of the once solidly blue state, home to a diverse, working-class population that relies heavily on tourism.</p> 
<p>In the national battle for party expansion, Republicans have the edge in the Silver State.</p> 
<p>Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen joined an octet of members in the Senate Democratic Caucus who backed ending the shutdown. Their home state politics made their gambit an electoral calculation and an economic necessity, even as it angered some Nevada Democrats, according to interviews with more than a dozen political strategists, staffers and elected officials in the state.</p> 
<p>“Nevada isn't a blue state — it's a swing state with a Democratic lean and a Republican trend line,” said Mike Noble, a pollster who focuses on the Southwest. “Both senators are reading the room, and brinksmanship doesn't play well with the middle.”</p> 
<p>The GOP advantage in Nevada has been building for several years. <a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/republicans-take-voter-registration-lead-in-nevada-for-first-time-since-2007" target="_blank">Republicans overtook Democrats in voter registration</a> for the first time in nearly two decades this year, the result of a dedicated campaign from the Nevada Republican Party. Polls show GOP Gov. Joe Lombardo with a slight lead in his reelection bid, which will be one of the most competitive gubernatorial races next year. And Republicans are trying to flip Democrats’ three House seats in Nevada next year. In 2024, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win the state in 20 years, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2024-election/results/nevada/" target="_blank">beating Kamala Harris by 3.1 points</a>, while Rosen won reelection by just 1 point.</p> 
<p>"Nevada has really tightened up," said Robert Uithoven, a GOP strategist from the state .</p> 
<p>Republicans and Democrats are fiercely courting Nevada’s working class. In 2024, Trump appealed to the state’s service, hospitality and construction industries <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/14/trump-harris-taxes-tips-nevada-00173909" target="_blank">with promises to end taxes on tips and overtime</a> — both policies that were passed in the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill.” And his campaign also made significant investment in reaching Latinos, who make up one in five registered voters.</p> 
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping that the sluggish economy, GOP-backed health care cuts and aggressive deportations under Trump will help them win back anxious Nevadans.</p> 
<p>“If you hear someone who is saying we are not going to tax your tips, that's compelling,” said Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill, who is running in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. “That economic message is consistently what we need to drive home as Democrats and get away from that corporate message."</p> 
<p>Nevada’s economy is tethered to the tourism industry, fueled by hourly wage hospitality workers. The state has seen a massive downturn in travel this year after major post-pandemic increases, which — coupled with <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/09/23/plunge-in-home-sales-contributes-to-drop-in-construction-employment-say-experts/" target="_blank">a sharp drop-off in construction jobs</a> — sparked concern among economists and local officials, who largely gauge the health of the local economy on its tourism industry.</p> 
<p>The state’s heavy reliance on federal aid also makes it more susceptible to partisan swings. The freeze on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program resulting from the government shutdown hurt the 15 percent of Nevadans who receive SNAP benefits, among <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Nevada" target="_blank">the highest shares of any state</a>. And recent disruptions around air travel significantly affected flights coming and going from Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. On Saturday, the airport recorded <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/analyst-says-flight-reductions-may-not-be-as-bad-as-expected-3535423/" target="_blank">198 flight delays</a>.</p> 
<p>Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the politically influential Culinary Union, praised the two senators for “clearly fighting for working-class folks” but noted that now is the time to “get the government going and get the benefits moving.”</p> 
<p>“At the end of the day, it's about who is going to be in the corner of working-class folks,” he said. “The Democrats' ship has been wandering the last few years, and the voters have been very clear about that.”<br></p><img src="https://static.politico.com/77/de/cb2557764bec891cef4662a9fbe7/election-2024-nevada-senate-24729.jpg" alt="Sen.

Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) speaks to supporters during an election watch party in Las Vegas on Nov. 6, 2024"/><p>Both Cortez Masto and Rosen signaled they sided with Republicans on ending the shutdown because of its severe effects on workers. Cortez Masto, who also voted to end the shutdown over a month ago, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/03/catherine-cortez-masto-draws-democratic-ire-amid-shutdown-fight-00593757" target="_blank">defended her recent vote</a> by citing the pinch felt by small businesses and other workers. Rosen, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rosen.senate.gov/2025/11/10/rosen-statement-on-government-funding-health-care-deal-vote/" target="_blank">said she hit a breaking point in recent days</a> as she saw the effect of “fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt.”</p> 
<p>“How do you stay the course when people are rummaging through the trash for food because Donald Trump took away their SNAP benefits?” said one Rosen aide, granted anonymity to speak openly. “At some point, you’re hurting the people you’re trying to help by not putting an end to the Trump cruelty.”</p> 
<p>Rosen is up for reelection in 2030; Cortez Masto in 2028.</p> 
<p>Scott Gavorsky, the GOP Elko County chair, predicted the senators would have dealt with blowback from voters had they prolonged the shutdown, especially in areas that have trended to the right, like in the rural region he represents that helped Lombardo flip the governorship in 2022. “Memories are long out here,” he said.</p> 
<p>But the pair is already facing backlash. Some Nevada Democrats voiced frustration with their decision to break from the caucus after Democrats stuck together for over a month.</p> 
<p>Democratic State Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch said she’s heard from many constituents in her swing district in Washoe County, which encompasses Reno, over their “concern about whether we are actually putting the brakes on a reckless authoritarian administration.”</p> 
<p>“I have heard overwhelming shock and dismay and concern that we have now given up the fight, and what are we getting out of it?” she said.</p> 
<p>A Democratic state party strategist, granted anonymity to speak freely, called the agreement with Republicans to vote on extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits at the heart of Democrats’ shutdown negotiations a bonus.</p> 
<p>“At the end of the day it isn't focused on political tactics, it’s focused on ending this pain,” the strategist said.</p> 
<p>The tourism-dependent state experienced the nation’s highest unemployment rates during the 2008 recession and 2020 pandemic shutdown, after it had become one of the fastest-growing economies in the nation from 1970 to 2008.</p> 
<p>Trump’s 2015 ascent came just in time to exploit Nevadans’ lingering pessimism, said Andrew Woods, the director of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’ Center for Business and Economic Research. Then, when Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak shut down Nevada’s casinos for 78 days during the 2020 pandemic, the state’s unemployment rate ballooned again, reaching 28 percent in April 2020.</p> 
<p>“That sense of security was taken away,” Woods said. “It made the state purple.”</p> 
<p>Republicans are making a big play in Nevada in next year’s midterms, hoping to flip three seats including the one held by Democrat Susie Lee, who represents many workers on the Las Vegas strip.</p> 
<p>But Trump’s Nevada victory was fueled by economic dissatisfaction, and recent polling suggests Nevadans aren’t much more satisfied now. In an October poll <a href="https://www.noblepredictiveinsights.com/post/nevadans-caught-between-hope-and-a-hard-place" target="_blank">from Noble Predictive Insights</a>, 50 percent of respondents said the state is worse now than it was four years ago, and just 24 percent said it is better. Their top issues were affordable housing and inflation.</p> 
<p>“The electorate is definitely more driven by economic anxiety than ideology these days,” said Mike Noble, the pollster.</p>]]></content:encoded>
